Thanks, Juan, for the review.  I have pushed a new patch set that fixes a problem I discovered in re-testing my fix, which is that if the LoadingUtils::loadResourcesInModelSet method is the first code to access the PapyrusToolkit class, then that class's initialization fails on a SWT illegal-thread-access exception.  This happens, for example, when the very first thing you do on launching the workbench is to try to load a submodel unit.

With regard to the problems I'm seeing with invalid menu actions, read-only states of resources, and units showing at the top level of the Model Explorer, I have attached a video to the bugzilla that shows what I'm seeing.  On the master branch I also see the incorrect menu actions on a not-yet-loaded unit, but attempting to load it runs into all kinds of exceptions and error dialogs, so attempts to reproduce the rest of the issues on master are blocked.

I don't think this could be a Mac-specific problem, but I could be convinced  :-)

I wonder... What happens if you unload a modified resource? Is this really a non-dirtying operation? Should this even be allowed?

The dirtying operation is whatever changed the contents of the resource such that it needs to be saved.  Loading and unloading resources doesn't change the abstract state of the model.

But, I do agree that there should be some kind of prompt to require saving before unloading the resource.  I don't think the user should have the option of unloading anyways without save because that can leave dangling references in other resources to new objects that were added to that resource but never saved.  This would be something new, but as critically important as not hanging the UI thread.
