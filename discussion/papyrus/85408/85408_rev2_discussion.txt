Bug 507860 - [Model Import] Update the model import to add port label
into composite structure diagrams

* modify the Qvto transfo to generate a decorationNode for Port_Shape
* add junit test to test that for each port shape we have a name label
decoration node

Looks good; I have only minor comments.

But also a question because I don't understand the QVTo transform very well in general.  If the source RSA diagram deliberately omits the label for some port (the user deleted it), then this won't create an unwanted label in the Papyrus diagram, right?  It only adds conversion of an existing port label?
Line:247, extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa/transform/RSAStructureDiagram.qvto -> Some indentation and whitespace around operators would make this more readable.  And the oclAsType(Location) cast can be factored out:

  var thisLayoutConstraint := (self.layoutConstraint.map toLayout(self.diagram)).oclAsType(Location)

for even better legibility ;-)

Line:525, extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa/transform/RSAStructureDiagram.qvto -> Why is the 'Name' type now excluded?  (I don't know whether it can be expected to occur)

Line:137, tests/junit/extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/migration/rsa/tests/regression/StructureDiagramTest.java -> Just a small typo.

Line:143, tests/junit/extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/migration/rsa/tests/regression/StructureDiagramTest.java -> Did you format this file?  I would have expected these two lines to be further indented.

I recommend setting the Java Save Actions preference to format the file automatically.

Yes, it will not add an unwanted label in the papyrus diagram. in fact, the idea is to take the "PortName" Decoration Node as it was defined in RSA file and transform it to "Port_NameLabel" DecorationNode. so if the user delete explicitly the port label in the RSA diagram, the visible attribute of PortName node will be set to false, and it will be also set to false for the newly created Port_NameLabel. This fix only add the missed Port_NameLabel decoration node since in the previous version of the transformation, the decoration node typed "PortName" was not transformed that's why I removed the Name and the PartName type test because if the semantic element is a port, the RSA type is PortName and not Name or PartName.

Line:247, extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa/transform/RSAStructureDiagram.qvto -> Done

Line:525, extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa/transform/RSAStructureDiagram.qvto -> No, if the semantic element is port, there is no decoration node typed "Name" or "PartName", the decoration node is typed "PortName" I think that Camille put the Name and the PartName for all test for quickly have the transfo working, but for some Node, we will not find decoration node typed "Name" or "PartName" and this was exactly the cause why the PortName_Label was not created (port have no label in papyrus diagram'

Line:137, tests/junit/extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/migration/rsa/tests/regression/StructureDiagramTest.java -> Done

Line:143, tests/junit/extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/migration/rsa/tests/regression/StructureDiagramTest.java -> No :( I thought that the formatting is automatic :( I used to type ctrl shift F to format java code, but I should as you said enable the formatting while saving, but I think that in Papyrus RT Checkstyle  do this no ?

Line:525, extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa/transform/RSAStructureDiagram.qvto -> Very clear.  Thanks!

Line:143, tests/junit/extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/migration/rsa/tests/regression/StructureDiagramTest.java -> No, CheckStyle only validates some aspects of formatting.  It never modifies the text.
