Undo/redo works well.  Thanks!  It looks odd, though, that undo/redo changes the selection in the Model Explorer even when focus is currently in a diagram editor.  Especially if I have "link with editor" turned on in the explorer because in that case, the linking of the selection doesn't actually happen (which is a good thing, but looks like a bug).  I would expect the changed selection on undo/redo to be reflected in the diagram, but it isn't.  It's only selection changes caused by mouse or keyboard in the explorer view that are propagated to the diagram.

Anyways, that can all be avoided simply by having the RevealResultCommand do its thing only if its view part is currently active.  That's actually better than what I suggested last time (I suggested then that the command should operate on whatever is the current view, but that would be bad, because that view may provide IRevealSemanticElement but not be the explorer, which would be confusing at best).
Line:1, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer.newchild/messages.properties -> Also, "Preferences page for ..." is redundant.  Perhaps just "Behaviour after creation ..." ?

Line:1, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer.newchild/messages.properties -> Should not have space before the colon.

Line:2, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer.newchild/messages.properties -> The code supports selection of all new elements in case there's more than one.  How about just "Select the new element(s)" ?

Line:34, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer.newchild/plugin.xml -> This is a nice touch!
However, the name of the menu action has two problems:  (a) because it opens a modal dialog, the label should be suffixed by an ellipsis; and (b) the name should accurately reflect its purpose.  "Default Selection" is too specific because there could be more new-child-menu preferences in the future.  I think something like "New Child Menu Preferences..." would be a better menu item label here.

Line:25, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer.newchild/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/newchild/messages/Messages.java -> Why not the Eclipse/Equinox style of messages class?

Further to your comments, I modified the different labels before the minor changes sink to oblivion (or to transform into bug task).

The issue about synchronisation with diagram, I didn't see generic solution which can publish event or something else to synchronise all selection listener (I confess I tried with view part's selection provider but nothing happens).
