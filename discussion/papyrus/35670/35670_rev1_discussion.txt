Redoing a new element creation that was undone does not select-reveal the (re)created element.

I understand that we can't just do as an EMF-generated editor does and attach a command-stack listener that selects the affected objects of whatever was the last command executed/undone/redone, because it could have been a command in the diagram or other context that should not alter the Model Explorer selection.   So, the idea of the command wrapper is neat.

However, the command-wrapper would be more reusable/safe if it didn't explicitly look for the Model Explorer view (maybe there are multiple instances of it!) but instead checked that the currently active view provides the IRevealSemanticElement protocol.  Also, it should account for selecting the object(s) affected by undo and redo.  In the case of redo, that's the same as execute, but in the case of undo, the affected object should be the one that the new object had been created in.

Also, why select-reveal only the first result?  If multiple objects were created, I would expect all of them to be selected.  At least, this is how EMF-generated editors work.
