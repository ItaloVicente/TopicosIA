Yes, I wasn't suggesting that the synchronization should be made to work, but actually that the selection management only be done if the Model Explorer view is (still) the active view when undoing/redoing.  But on further reflection, I think that would also be confusing, and seeing the impact of undo/redo on the model is useful whatever the context.
