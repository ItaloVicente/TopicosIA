DESCRIPTION:

Bug 526158 - [ElementTypes] Element types editor freezes

- Disable translation option in provider, in addition to first patch now for stereotype-application related
  functions. While this solves the problem, it's not clear if this is a good solution, as it modifies
  generated files (at least, a re-generation from the genmodel does not remove the added code)
  I propose the patch as workaround, until a better solution is found
