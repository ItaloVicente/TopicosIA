DESCRIPTION:

Merge branch 'bugs/570097-architecture-builder' into bugs/568494-toolsmiths-dev

Bug 570097: [Toolsmiths] Architecture Domains: Validation Builder

Architecture plug-in builder:
- initial Architecture plug-in builder at parity (plus a bit) with the menu action
- JUnit test coverage
- externalization of strings in architecture, types, and common builder plug-ins
- documentation updates for architecture plug-in validation and the architecture view

Fixes in Architecture View:
- fix Architecture view to update when preferences are changed, especially
  to show contexts registered from models in the workspace
- fix the ArchitectureDomainManager API to report all registered model URIs,
  including from preferences (used by Architecture view and Load Resource
  dialog in the Architecture Model Editor)

Fixes for builder framework problems found in testing:
- workspace-aware package registry doesn't get dynamic EPackages
- dependency checking doesn't check for bundle containing referenced icon
- custom model checker supertypes checking doesn't cross EPackage boundary
- missing check for referenced icons' existence

Some follow-up on Element Types Configurations plug-in builder:
- add Element Types builder test for case of types set referenced
  by a registered architecture model, which presents no problem
- update the test fixture to register architecture models imported
  in test projects for the duration of the test, required for the
  new test case
- add validation of icon resources in Element Types Configurations models
  as was done for Architecture Context models

Enhancements to common plug-in builder framework:
- support checking for cross-referenced resources in the build.properties
- look up packages in the resource set's registry, not the shared instance
  (because Architecture Models are loaded in a resource set with workspace packages)
- support loading resources to be validated in a resource set with a custom
  package registry (again for Architecture Models)

Architecture Framework improvements:
- support references to locally loaded element type configurations in the
  palette configuration editor
- give the Architecture Model Editor access to packages registered in the workspace

Architecture Model Editor Fixes:
- fix the class cast exception on attempt to load registered Architecture Models
- while we're at it, only show models not already loaded in the editor

Bug 539694: The Architecture models raises bad errors

- new ClasspathHelper utility to search for classes on the JDT
  workspace classpath
- reimplement "class exists" constraints using the ClasspathHelper
- requires passing information about class types down the plug-in
  dependency graph, which is done by annotation of the
  command-class attributes in the Ecore models

Line:8, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.architecture/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> why inner class?

Thanks for the review, Patrick! I know it was a big one.
Line:8, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.architecture/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> That's the pattern that EMF generates. The outer class extends EMFPlugin, which isn't a bundle activator but which provides API such as access to strings (for validation messages etc.) in the plugin.properties. The inner class is a bundle activator to which the outer class delegates in an OSGi deployment. The outer class "plugin" singleton can be used without OSGi.
