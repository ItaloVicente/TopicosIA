DESCRIPTION:

Merge branch 'bugs/570097-architecture-builder' into bugs/568494-toolsmiths-dev

Bug 570097: [Toolsmiths] Architecture Domains: Validation Builder

Architecture plug-in builder:
- initial Architecture plug-in builder at parity (plus a bit) with the menu action
- JUnit test coverage
- externalization of strings in architecture, types, and common builder plug-ins
- documentation updates for architecture plug-in validation and the architecture view

Fixes in Architecture View:
- fix Architecture view to update when preferences are changed, especially
  to show contexts registered from models in the workspace
- fix the ArchitectureDomainManager API to report all registered model URIs,
  including from preferences (used by Architecture view and Load Resource
  dialog in the Architecture Model Editor)

Fixes for builder framework problems found in testing:
- workspace-aware package registry doesn't get dynamic EPackages
- dependency checking doesn't check for bundle containing referenced icon
- custom model checker supertypes checking doesn't cross EPackage boundary
- missing check for referenced icons' existence

Some follow-up on Element Types Configurations plug-in builder:
- add Element Types builder test for case of types set referenced
  by a registered architecture model, which presents no problem
- update the test fixture to register architecture models imported
  in test projects for the duration of the test, required for the
  new test case
- add validation of icon resources in Element Types Configurations models
  as was done for Architecture Context models

Enhancements to common plug-in builder framework:
- support checking for cross-referenced resources in the build.properties
- look up packages in the resource set's registry, not the shared instance
  (because Architecture Models are loaded in a resource set with workspace packages)
- support loading resources to be validated in a resource set with a custom
  package registry (again for Architecture Models)

Architecture Framework improvements:
- support references to locally loaded element type configurations in the
  palette configuration editor
- give the Architecture Model Editor access to packages registered in the workspace

Bug 539694: The Architecture models raises bad errors

- new ClasspathHelper utility to search for classes on the JDT
  workspace classpath
- reimplement "class exists" constraints using the ClasspathHelper
- requires passing information about class types down the plug-in
  dependency graph, which is done by annotation of the
  command-class attributes in the Ecore models

There's a lot in this Gerrit patch; please read the commit comment for details.

Of particular note is that this includes a commit to fix bug 539694, which blocks completion of the Architecture Plug-in Builder feature. But there is also a separate Gerrit patch for this commit targeting the master branch.

That looks very good to me, with the addition of many JUnit tests, documentation and also management of local or deployed artifacts.
I only one issue during testing, that I initially thought related to this improvement. I have a ClassCastException when trying to load a registered architecture in the architecture basic editor, but I checked before the patch, same exception is thrown. 
Here is a part of the stack trace I could get:
java.lang.ClassCastException: class org.eclipse.emf.common.util.URI$Hierarchical cannot be cast to class java.lang.Comparable (org.eclipse.emf.common.util.URI$Hierarchical is in unnamed module of loader org.eclipse.osgi.internal.loader.EquinoxClassLoader @36ecf9f6; java.lang.Comparable is in module java.base of loader 'bootstrap')
	at java.base/java.util.ComparableTimSort.countRunAndMakeAscending(ComparableTimSort.java:320)
	at java.base/java.util.ComparableTimSort.sort(ComparableTimSort.java:188)
	at java.base/java.util.Arrays.sort(Arrays.java:1249)
	at org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.architecture.editor.ExtendedLoadResourceAction$RegisteredArchitectureDialog.createDialogArea(ExtendedLoadResourceAction.java:116)

Thanks, Rémi. I found this also in my work on bug 570486 and fixed it there. But I had thought of porting my fix into this patch, so now I am more motivated to do so. :-)
