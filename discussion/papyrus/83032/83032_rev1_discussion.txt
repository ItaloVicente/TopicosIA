- let connection anchor calculate the position for all cases, no need to handle different cases (north, east, ...) => code is simpler
- more precise by using a precise rectangle figure before the conversion to absolute (implies scaling)
- specific support for handling the case that port is not exactly on the bounds (1 pixel deviation) on a rectangular figure

This useful information should be in the commit comment.

Apart from that, I am happy to see code removed/simplified, but I don't feel qualified to approve these changes.  I don't understand why the code was as it was previously.

Port position is a sensitive matter (we already had many regression on this point) and it would be for the best to add unit tests (ex: PortPositionLocatorTest)

I agree. Do you know which things we need to test or what is perhaps already covered by existing tests? I've manually checked the composite structure and the state-machine diagram (with entry/exit points) at different zoom levels. The latter is interesting, since the state borders are rounded.
Concerning, the test implementation itself, I do not have the knowledge to implement graphical tests right now.

@Ansgard: I would prefer avoid graphical test.

For example :I suggest to extract a method that get the position from parentRecatangle and currentRectangle.
You can put it in PortPositionLocatorUtils if you want then create a basic junit test that check the algo in PortPositionLocatorUtilsTest.

It's pure java/junit on geometry algo

Could add Junit Test for this method.
Because I do rememeber how many modifications that have bee done for this class
