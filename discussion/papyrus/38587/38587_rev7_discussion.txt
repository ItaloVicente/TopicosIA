DESCRIPTION:

Papyrus test generation framework for diagram editors

Changes by Christian W. Damus <give.a.damus@gmail.com>:

Rebase onto latest Mars post M6 master branch.

Fix .ignores: ensure that only contents of xtend-gen/ folders are ignored,
not the folders themselves

Convert Xtend codegen templates to UTF-8 encoding

Update the QVTo transformation to support the statically generated
UTP profile.  This requires:

- invoking the UMLResourcesUtil API for stand-alone set-up
- updating the profile-registration workflow component to support
   the registration of a statically generated profile
- updating the QVTo transformation to ensure that applicable
   stereotypes are resolved in the proper ResourceSet context to
   avoid losing all applied stereotypes in the generated test model.
   This, in turn, requires a Java black box to handle the EMF-specific
   concerns of resource-set context that QVTo is not aware of

Fix build.properties files to include all sources.

Fix compilation problems in the integration of the generated tests into
the master suite bundle.  Update the Tycho build to include the test generation
framework bundle.  Update the build and Oomph setup to include the UPR profile
bundle dependency.

Fix numerous codegen problems:

- base model does not reflect correct package name for palette tests
- inject replaceable templates instead of making them all static
- add generation of import statements in suites
- fix references to test constants interface
- fix references to diagram creation command

Fix remaining compilation errors in Use Case tests:

- look up the DiagramUpdater class to compute correct import
- factor out creation of generated files into an utility extension
- factor out generation of the copyright header comment
- add some imports to templates that were missing them

Refactor Xtend codegen templates to:

- improve management of imports
- improve names of AllXyzTestsGen suite classes
- don't generate test classes that have no test cases
- share common code to simplify the specific test case templates

Regenerate all diagram test bundles that have UTP test models.  Some
changes had to be applied after the fact to fix up problems, as follows:

  Class Diagram:
  * missing ElementImports in the TestClassDiagramChildLabelNodeGen
    context, but easily fixed with Organize Imports

  Component Diagram:
  * extraneous ElementImports in source diagram for edit part classes
    that don't exist (fixed by Organize Imports)

  Composite Structure Diagram:
  * diagram creation command name breaks from the usual pattern. Need
    to be able to specify it in the source UML model?
  * same for the IXyzDiagramTestsConstants interface in the test bundle
  * extraneous ElementImports in source diagram for edit part classes
    that don't exist (fixed by Organize Imports)

  Profile Diagram:
  * the IXyzDiagramTestsConstants interface doesn't conform to the
    conventional naming pattern, easily fixed by renaming it
  * source UML model has ElementImports for edit-part classes that
    don't exist.  Organize Imports fixes that

  Sequence Diagram:
  * the UMLDiagramUpdater class doesn't have a static INSTANCE field
    (this diagram hasn't been regenerated from the Mars version of the
    diagram codegen templates)
