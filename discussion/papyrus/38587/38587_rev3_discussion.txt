DESCRIPTION:

Papyrus test generation framework for diagram editors

Changes by Christian W. Damus <give.a.damus@gmail.com>:

Rebase onto latest Mars post M6 master branch.

Fix .ignores: ensure that only contents of xtend-gen/ folders are ignored,
not the folders themselves

Convert Xtend codegen templates to UTF-8 encoding

Update the QVTo transformation to support the statically generated
UTP profile.  This requires:

- invoking the UMLResourcesUtil API for stand-alone set-up
- updating the profile-registration workflow component to support
   the registration of a statically generated profile
- updating the QVTo transformation to ensure that applicable
   stereotypes are resolved in the proper ResourceSet context to
   avoid losing all applied stereotypes in the generated test model.
   This, in turn, requires a Java black box to handle the EMF-specific
   concerns of resource-set context that QVTo is not aware of

Fix build.properties files to include all sources.

Fix numerous codegen problems:

- base model does not reflect correct package name for palette tests
- inject replaceable templates instead of making them all static
- add generation of import statements in suites
- fix references to test constants interface
- fix references to diagram creation command

Fix remaining compilation errors in Use Case tests:

- look up the DiagramUpdater class to compute correct import
- factor out creation of generated files into an utility extension
- factor out generation of the copyright header comment
- add some imports to templates that were missing them

Patch Set 3:

I've posted a new patch set that fixes the build failure on a badly merged bundle manifest and updates the templates to fix the remaining compilation errors in the tests generated for the Use Case Diagram.  (I haven't tested other diagrams, yet)

The patch set still contains all of the generated files that were included in the first patch set in 2014, which have many compilation errors in the Mars context.  Once I have generation working for the other diagrams, I'll split out the generated code into one or more separate patches.

Patch Set 3:

Patch set 4 completes the first phase of updates to the tests generation framework to align with the current Mars codebase.  It also regenerates all diagram tests that have UTP test models (the Communication Diagram tests bundle does not have one).  As indicated in the commit comment, there are still some gaps in the framework and/or templates.  I reiterate here for clarity.

Class Diagram:
* missing ElementImports in the TestClassDiagramChildLabelNodeGen context, but easily fixed with Organize Imports

Component Diagram:
* extraneous ElementImports in source diagram for edit part classes that don't exist (fixed by Organize Imports)

Composite Structure Diagram:
* diagram creation command name breaks from the usual pattern. Need to be able to specify it in the source UML model?
* same for the IXyzDiagramTestsConstants interface in the test bundle
* extraneous ElementImports in source diagram for edit part classes that don't exist (fixed by Organize Imports)

Profile Diagram:
* the IXyzDiagramTestsConstants interface doesn't conform to the conventional naming pattern, easily fixed by renaming it
* source UML model has ElementImports for edit-part classes that don't exist.  Organize Imports fixes that

Sequence Diagram:
* the UMLDiagramUpdater class doesn't have a static INSTANCE field (this diagram hasn't been regenerated from the Mars version of the diagram codegen templates)

Some of these problems simply need to be addressed in the source UTP models (e.g., extraneous element imports) whereas others would need enhancements to the codegen framework to accommodate peculiarities of some diagrams.  That is the next phase.
