Hello there,
I have look quickly to the project.
It seems that we need to discuss on how to integrate modifications for doc generation and xtend generation.

Line:1, plugins/developer/org.eclipse.papyrus.mwe2.utils/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/mwe2/utils/XtendWorkflow.java -> missing header

Line:1, tests/framework/org.eclipse.papyrus.tests.framework/doc/doc.mediawiki -> Documentation is not in plugins/doc
Should integrate also the frameork that generate the html files directly from the mediawiki one
Ask to francois LF

Line:1, tests/framework/org.eclipse.papyrus.tests.framework/pom.xml -> presence a lot of xtend files but no maven xtend plugin called.
need to be integrated
Ask to Francois LF

Line:1, tests/junit/plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence.tests/test-gen/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/test/AllGenTests.java -> A lot of test-gen folders, are we able to regenerate it at build time.
Call francois LF

Line:12, releng/user.setup -> You don't want to share your Oomph user setup model in the repository. :-)

Line:3, tests/framework/org.eclipse.papyrus.tests.framework/.project -> "Papyrus Tests Framework" is a very general name, and implies that it covers not only generation of tests for diagram editors, but also generation of tests for other kinds of components and also more than generation of tests.  A "test framework" is a system for the implementation of tests.  JUnit is a test framework.  TestNG is a test framework.  What we have here is a diagram test generation framework, or perhaps a test generation framework if it is intended to be extended to non-diagram components.
