There are a few issues with this contribution, but it is definitely going in the right direction.

I'm concerned about the following:

- core.sasheditor and core.sasheditor.di receive new dependencies, to respectively emf.ecore and gmf.notation. The first one may make sense (Although the Sasheditor is supposed to be a pure-graphical component, without any dependency to the underlying model technology), but I'm concerned about the explicit dependency on "Diagram". "getLocalPages" is not able to handle Tables, for example. I understand that Tables are not important in the Export All Diagrams (Because this action doesn't now how to convert Tables to Image), but then it should be the responsibility of the caller to ignore everything which is not a Notation Diagram; allLocalPages() should simply return all local Pages; not all local Diagrams

This probably means that a specific service or adapter could/should be able to determine what "local" means. I'm not sure this is possible with the current available information.

- The ExportAllDiagrams Dialog/Composite needs an IFile to find its output directory. What about CDO models which are not stored in an IFile? The dialog should take an Output directory parameter directly; not an IFile which it uses to compute the Output directory. If an IFile is available, then it can be used to set the Output directory. If it is not available, then a new input field should be available in the dialog (Well, it already exists, so that's fine).

There could be other improvements. Especially, the use of Java Property Testers is not recommended, because it can only be executed if the plug-in is already loaded. This means that you either need to force the plug-in to load early (Slowing down the Eclipse startup), or accept that the menu is not accurately displayed (e.g. the menu appears although the selection is invalid). It is easy to test a File extension or EObject selection with the Eclipse Expression framework, without the need of a custom Java Property Tester
