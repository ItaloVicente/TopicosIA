(For some reason, I can't insert inline comments)

In ExportAllDiagramsEngine, line 228:

This will exclude diagrams on controlled models. This raises an interesting issue, on being able to distinguish between "local" diagrams and "imported" diagrams. The IPageManager should be responsible for proposing the two alternatives. For example, you could add an "allLocalPages()" method, in addition to "allPages()". This would also help improving the ModelExplorer display: currently, when displaying all root diagrams, we can't distinguish between imported and local diagrams.

To properly implement this method, you need to rely on the diagram's semantic element, and check whether this semantic element is contained (directly or indirectly) in the main model. This is required, because diagrams themselves are never "controlled", whereas semantic elements can be.

I am going to work  to add to IPageManager the feature of distinction between Local and Imported diagrams. I also used EcoreUtils#isAncetor(...) in PropertyTester for the same reason.
