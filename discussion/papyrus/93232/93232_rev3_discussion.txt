Now we are starting to get somewhere. I am not sure though, that I have the time to actually test the code (I don't have a development environment for Papyrus up and running). What is really the expected the end result of all this? Will it produce a label as originally proposed in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=351865? I cannot really see anything related to the " : " separator between the partition name itself and the name of whatever it represents?

Are there any other "requirements" regarding how the label should look like? Since (as discussed before) is not something that is specified in the UML 2.5 specification, I guess some other input "requirements" must exist.

I believe Pauline has an environment, maybe she can have a look at it ?
