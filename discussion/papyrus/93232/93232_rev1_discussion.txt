Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> You seem to have some issues regarding providing proper Change-Ids to your commits (considering the number of duplicated Gerrit changes created). Here you have also gotten two different Change-Ids in the same commit message. I suggest that you consistently always do "git amend". If you use EGit then you have the amend button above the commit message box in the staging view. This ensures that the previous commit message, including the correct Change-Id is carried over to ensure that you create a new patch-set for the existing Gerrit change, instead of creating new Gerrit changes.

Line:50, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.activity/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/activity/edit/policies/ActivityPartitionLabelEditPolicy.java -> Can it really be assumed that represents is a ConnectableElement here?

Line:136, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.activity/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/activity/helper/ActivityPartitionLabelHelper.java -> I don't think that you can assume that just because represents was not a ConnectableElement, that it is a NamedElement? represents could theoretically be a non-NamedElement since it is an Element. I am still not sure regarding this "obsession" about ConnectableElement? Since partitions can represents "anything", you should not really bother about the case with ConnectableElement. I think that you think too much about lifelines in interactions, which only can represents ConnectableElements. But the partitions is much more flexible, and can directly represents actors, classes and so on, and not as lifelines which needs to represents a property typed by an actor, class and so on. I strongly suggest that you *only* consider whether represents is a NamedElement or not.

Hi Guy,
I test your proposal, it works better but I still have some problem. I got a ClassCastException if the represents is not an NamedElement, a comment for example (it is not really relevant but it is possible). As Peter Cigehn says, the represents can be anything so you shouldn't cast it in NamedElement.
Regards,
Pauline

I have made the changes. I also found the problem with the amend, it turned out to be that the changeid line needed not to be followed by a blank line ...
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> I know Peter, I keep a single one and do an amend, but somehow, another one sneaks in. Something seems messed up. Didn't figure out what.

Line:50, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.activity/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/activity/edit/policies/ActivityPartitionLabelEditPolicy.java -> I have changed this to the more generic Element.
