DESCRIPTION:

Bug 569357: [Toolsmiths] ElementTypes: Model and Plug-in Validation

- fix exception on attempt to clear unmodifiable list when resetting Architecture Context
  preferences
- let the workspace copy of an Architecture Context model supersede the deployed platform
  copy
- ensure that relative cross-document references in the Architecture Context model resolve
  from workspace to platform where applicable
- ensure loading unique copy of any given Architecture Context model even if redundantly
  added via preferences
- fix generic EMF model validation builder not supporting relative platform-scheme HREFs
- factor out common project builder behaviours, including:
  - mapping the project for EMF resources to check
  - separate reporting of diagnostics from creation of markers to avoid creating redundant
    markers
  - common framework for EMF model validation checkers on EMF resources
  	- including custom toolsmith-specific validation rules that cannot be implemented in
  	  the model
  - common framework for build.properties checkers
  - common framework for bundle dependencies checkers
  - common framework for plugin.xml extensions checkers
- implement the common checkers frameworks for element-types
- implement custom Element Types validation rules for UML Stereotypes
- add validation of stereotype application matcher and related configurations
- add validation of stereotype reference edge advice configurations
- involves moving the ModelResourceMapper class down the dependency tree and generalizing
  it some
- fix a flaw in the registration of a profile in the JUnit tests that causes an invalid
  URI to be registered in the UML2 API's EPackage-to-Profile map
- absorb the function of the custom ElementTypesConfigurationsValidator into the builder
- proper progress monitor delegation in the delegating builder
- normalize URIs with inclusion of mappings from the workspace also
- fix regressions in ad hoc element types plug-in validation menu action
- update JUnit test for menu action
- JUnit test coverage for element types builder validation
- add inference of profile resources in the same project that need to be packaged by
  the build.properties file
- factor out test project fixture into a new common tests bundle
- rename marker type constant to indicate what it is a type of
- ensure that ResourcesUtil works in the absence of PDE
- handle extraction of bundle dependency name from bundleresource:// URIs
- aupport aggregation of the same diagnostic from different sources into a single marker

Address review comments:
- fix mismatch of bundle version in manifest and POM
- continue using Java Problem marker type in ProfilePluginChecker's configuration of the
  ModelDependenciesChecker so that existing markers are deleted on clean build
- fix the search for external cross-references to check in the ModelDependenciesChecker
  to not include resources that a ModelSet loads for its own reasons
- check first for file scheme URI to report it as a problem, before handling other
  non-platform-scheme URIs
- fix exception in attempt to resolve stereotypes by unqualified name
- don't report dangling objects as cross-document references
- handle references to registered packages by namespace URI
- improved handling of HREFs that don't imply bundle names

Patch set 5 reports a warning for URIs that don't imply bundle names and filters out nulls in processing the bundle names.

Looks good to me, thank you! We'll see what to do if we ever actually get this warning 😊

Yeah. There could be legitimate cases for, e.g., referencing models deployed on the WWW, but I think in general we would like to encourage users to deploy everything in OSGi bundles, so some sort of message is probably warranted, anyways.
