DESCRIPTION:

Bug 569357: [Toolsmiths] ElementTypes: Model and Plug-in Validation

- fix exception on attempt to clear unmodifiable list when resetting Architecture Context
  preferences
- let the workspace copy of an Architecture Context model supersede the deployed platform
  copy
- ensure that relative cross-document references in the Architecture Context model resolve
  from workspace to platform where applicable
- ensure loading unique copy of any given Architecture Context model even if redundantly
  added via preferences
- fix generic EMF model validation builder not supporting relative platform-scheme HREFs
- factor out common project builder behaviours, including:
  - mapping the project for EMF resources to check
  - separate reporting of diagnostics from creation of markers to avoid creating redundant
    markers
  - common framework for EMF model validation checkers on EMF resources
  	- including custom toolsmith-specific validation rules that cannot be implemented in
  	  the model
  - common framework for build.properties checkers
  - common framework for bundle dependencies checkers
  - common framework for plugin.xml extensions checkers
- implement the common checkers frameworks for element-types
- implement custom Element Types validation rules for UML Stereotypes
- add validation of stereotype application matcher and related configurations
- add validation of stereotype reference edge advice configurations
- involves moving the ModelResourceMapper class down the dependency tree and generalizing
  it some
- fix a flaw in the registration of a profile in the JUnit tests that causes an invalid
  URI to be registered in the UML2 API's EPackage-to-Profile map
- absorb the function of the custom ElementTypesConfigurationsValidator into the builder
- proper progress monitor delegation in the delegating builder
- normalize URIs with inclusion of mappings from the workspace also
- fix regressions in ad hoc element types plug-in validation menu action
- update JUnit test for menu action
- JUnit test coverage for element types builder validation
- add inference of profile resources in the same project that need to be packaged by
  the build.properties file
- factor out test project fixture into a new common tests bundle
- rename marker type constant to indicate what it is a type of
- ensure that ResourcesUtil works in the absence of PDE
- handle extraction of bundle dependency name from bundleresource:// URIs
- aupport aggregation of the same diagnostic from different sources into a single marker

Address review comments:
- fix mismatch of bundle version in manifest and POM
- continue using Java Problem marker type in ProfilePluginChecker's configuration of the
  ModelDependenciesChecker so that existing markers are deleted on clean build
- fix the search for external cross-references to check in the ModelDependenciesChecker
  to not include resources that a ModelSet loads for its own reasons
- check first for file scheme URI to report it as a problem, before handling other
  non-platform-scheme URIs
- fix exception in attempt to resolve stereotypes by unqualified name

Thanks for the changes! I played a bit more with this and found some weird validation errors. Some of them are unrelated to your changes so I've reported them separately; but the ones below seem directly related:

Cross-document reference by file URI is not portable: ''.	StaticProfileDemo.profile.di	/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmith.demo.profile/resources	Unknown	Java Problem

The URI 'http://www.eclipse.org/uml2/5.0.0/Types' cannot be resolved.	StaticProfileDemo.profile.di	/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmith.demo.profile/resources	Unknown	Java Problem

The URI 'http://www.eclipse.org/uml2/5.0.0/UML' cannot be resolved.	StaticProfileDemo.profile.di	/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmith.demo.profile/resources	Unknown	Java Problem

These error seem to happen when a profile contains a dynamic definition
