Patch Set 4:

I've rebased this onto the latest master and off of change 176961 for bug 571560, so that they may be reviewed and merged independently.

Note, however, that the behaviour of the Negate refactoring will seem broken if tested without the other change being merged first. It is doing the right thing, but because without the other fix the NotRuleConfiguration does not contain its operand, the rule that is negated will disappear from the tree (and the resource!) which is wrong but only because of the bug fixed by the other change. It is not caused by the refactoring, itself.

Two test failures in the RuleRefactoringHandlerTest are caused by the bug 517561 that is fixed by change 176961. If I cannot update these tests to work independently, I may have to stack this change on top of that fix after all.
