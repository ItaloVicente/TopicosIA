DESCRIPTION:

417409: [Performances - Properties view] Delay in UI when reorganizing diagram layout.
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=417409

Make property sheet views reusable, with updating of the bound selection when the selection changes to another element that shows the same views.  This employs new capability of the DataSource to update the selection that it encapsulates, pushing the new selection into the ModelElements that it creates, using a new delegating observable framework.

Patch Set 1:

There are three groups of changes in this change-set:

(a) update the Properties View implementation to reuse the same SWT controls
    for its tabs when the selection changes to another single or multiple
    selection presenting the same Views (according to the property-sheet model).
    This is a "compatible" selection
	
(b) update the DataSource and ModelElement APIs that provide the source of
    data bindings in the Properties View to allow a compatible selection to be
    injected into the SWT controls already showing
	
(c) implementation of delegating observables that support the ModelElements'
    dynamic updating of their data-binding sources
	
Part (a) is largely just a matter of updating the DefaultDisplayEngine to detect that the set of Views it asked to provide tab-descriptors for is the same as the set of Views for which it last provided tabs.  In this case, the existing tabs and all of their controls are re-used and the new selection is pushed into the DataSource that is currently feeding these controls.  Hopefully, the infrastructural changes in parts (b) and (c) that make this possible will allow us to further refine the re-use of controls such that any View will only be created once and can be swapped in and out of tabs using PageBooks.

Part (b) updates the DataSource to support replacement of its selection.  On injection of a new selection, a notification is broadcast to announce the change and ModelElements listening to the DataSource update themselves to pick up the new selection.  This entails to fundamental changes in the way that ModelElements work:

  (i) the ModelElementFactory now tells a newly created ModelElement which
      factory created it, so that the ModelElement can delegate to that factory the
      update for a new selection.  This is necessary because it is the factory that
      knew how to unpack from the selection what the ModelElement needs when
      creating the  element, so it is the best able to update the element later.  All
      of the various ModelElementFactory implementations add this new capability
      to update an existing element with a new selection
	  
  (ii) when a ModelElement creates an IObservable for one of its properties, it
      now wraps that observable in a new delegator pattern.  The delegator is
      what ends up ultimately being bound to SWT controls.  To ensure that we
      don't have to rebuild those bindings every time the selection changes
      (which would entail considerable API churn to make accessible after the
      fact), these observable delegators allow their delegates to be replaced at
      any time (assuming that the replacement is the same kind of observable,
      based on the "compatible selection").  Replacing the delegate fires the
      usual observable change event, which updates the UI accordingly via the
      bindings.
	  
Part (c) is the implementation of the delegating observables.  They ensure that the entire contract of the underlying observable is provided (including all custom interfaces such as ICommitListener) via the dynamic proxy class mechanism.  The usual contract of observables is implemented, including tracking the invocation of getter methods, all verified with a fairly comprehensive suite of JUnits tests.
