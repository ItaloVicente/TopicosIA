DESCRIPTION:

417409: [Performances - Properties view] Delay in UI when reorganizing diagram layout.
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=417409

Make property sheet views reusable, with updating of the bound selection when the selection changes to another element that shows the same views.  SWT controls for each view are re-used on a per tab basis.  As long as the next selection shows the same sections in any given tab, the controls of that tab are reused as they are and not re-built from scratch.

This employs new capability of the DataSource to update the selection that it encapsulates, pushing the new selection into the ModelElements that it creates, using a new delegating observable framework.

Patch Set 3:

Patch set 3 updates the DefaultDisplayEngine to re-use SWT controls on a per-tab basis, for tabs that present the same controls for the new selection as for the previous selection.  The equivalence of the contents of a tab is determined by new equals() semantics (and accompanying hash codes, of course) for XWTSectionDescriptors and XWTTabDescriptors.  Essentially, two XWTTabDescriptors are equal (and therefore would generate the same SWT controls) if their IDs are equal and their ordered lists of section descriptors are equal.

With this change, the continuity of the property sheet UI is a bit better for the user:  when changing the selection, if the new selection presents the same tab with the same widgets as the currently active tab, then that tab just shows the newly selected element.  So, for example, once the user activates the Profile tab of an element to work with applied stereotypes, that tab seamlessly updates when selecting another shape in the diagram or another element in the Model Explorer (even going back-and-forth between diagram and explorer, where selections are GEF EditParts in the one case and facet tree-elements wrapping semantic model elements in the other).  There is no flashing of the UI as controls are destroyed and re-built to look as they did before.

This new patch set also fixes a problem in the delegating observables, in the case that the delegate is a delegating observable implemented as a dynamic proxy (new test cases added to cover this scenario).  This problem was uncovered in testing the customization of property-sheet models (the binding of the observable list for view constraints blew up).  The "Customization preview" [sic] view seems to work correctly, although I don't know what special cases there are to exercise in this view.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I've been playing a little bit with the selection and tab changes, and at some point the Appearance tab became completely empty. (Apparently, this happens when switching from the Diagram's "General" tab and a graphical element's "Appearance" tab. And the tab remains empty until I switch e.g. from a Class to a Property, probably because they have different contents in their appearance tab)

Steps:

- Create a Class diagram with classes and properties
- Select the diagram and go to the General tab
- Select a Class and go to the Appearance tab
- Switch back to the diagram: the General tab is empty
- Switch back to the class: the Appearance tab is empty
- Select a Property: the Appearance tab is now populated
- Select the Class: the Appearance tab is now populated
- Select the Diagram: the General tab is still empty
- Repeat from step 3 :)

Performances are otherwise really good, when switching between similar elements. Maybe this could be extended to "Similar Sections" (In addition to "Similar Tabs"): for the Appearance tab, almost all sections are the same, and this is the most heavy properties tab. Currently, if we reuse the same sections between two selections, but add a new one (or remove it), everything is redrawn (Although 80% of the contents is the same)

I also have quite a lot of exceptions when switching selection, especially in the dispose() methods, when using multiple selection (I'll attach the log file to the associated bugzilla)

Thanks, Camille.

I had a brief look at one point at reuse on a section-by-section basis, but that is complicated by the need to maintain a consistent ordering of widgets in the layout.  When a section is removed, disposing its controls is easy enough, but adding widgets is more complicated.  Perhaps I'll be inspired to take another crack at it and will find some trick that makes it work.
