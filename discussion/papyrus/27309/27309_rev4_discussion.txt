DESCRIPTION:

417409: [Performances - Properties view] Delay in UI when reorganizing diagram layout.
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=417409

Make property sheet views reusable, with updating of the bound selection when the selection changes to another element that shows the same views.  This employs new capability of the DataSource to update the selection that it encapsulates, pushing the new selection into the ModelElements that it creates, using a new delegating observable framework.

Property sheet controls are re-used on a per-tab basis.

Because of the new delegation pattern introduced here, we need to be able to ensure that delegate observables are disposed of when they are no longer needed.  This includes not only the delegates of the new DelegatingObservables, but also the delegates of MultipleObservableValue and similar aggregates.  As these delegates can be shared amongst multiple wrappers of different kinds, we use a simple reference counting scheme to ensure that observables are not disposed while they are still in use.  This averts the exceptions discovered in multi-observable (multiple selection) scenarios on a previous iteration of this patch set.

Patch Set 4:

Patch Set 4 fixes the two problems observed by Camille.  Firstly, and more simply, the problem of the General tab going blank.  The problem here was that the Tabbed Property Sheet would disposed of an entire tab and its contents if the new selection didn't need that tab at all, without any interaction with the XWT-based DisplayEngine.  So, the DefaultDisplayEngine would continue to try to show disposed controls for the General tab (or any other in the same situation).  Now the DefaultDisplayEngine listens for the disposal of the controls that it creates and cleans up its understanding of which reusable controls are still available for which sections in which tabs.

The exceptions in multiple-selection scenarios all boiled down to observables being prematurely disposed, either by the composite MultipleObservableValue, or by a DelegatingObservable, or by a ModelElement.  So, now all of these various components that can aggregate/share observables participate in a simple reference-counting scheme so that observables will only be disposed (and will be disposed automatically) when they are no longer in use by any component.
