DESCRIPTION:

Bug 476559: [Table] Sub-optimal performance when expanding subtrees
containing lots of children
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=476559

Manage the list event as a collection of range instead of manage one by
one item.
The validate and invalidate cache is managed only one time by item
expanded (this cache contains only the hierarchical index of the current
element to manage (we can't manage all because the lists will contains
too much elements (and decrease the process time) and because the expand
action managed by nattable allows to expand level by level)).
