DESCRIPTION:

Bug 434983: [SashEditor] Provide a mechanism to move the editor layout model to either the *.di (Legacy) or hidden *.sash resource (1.0)
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=434983

Implement new actions in the editor's drop-down tool menu for selection
of the the sash-editor page layout storage mode (private or shared).
Also prompt on first opening of a legacy-mode (shared layout) model to
make it private, as determined by the non-existence of a private *.sash
resource, with a corresponding preference page.

The SaveBeforeCloseService is enhanced to perform the check on first opening a model whether to prompt the user to migrate layout information from the *.di to the *.sash (or just by-pass the prompt according to the preferences).  This is in the SaveBeforeCloseService because that service is responsible for saving the layout information if necessary when no other changes in the model content are saved.

I suppose this means that this is now not just a "SaveBeforeCloseService", but I think "PageLayoutPersistenceService" would have been a better name originally anyways.  In any case, I don't think it's necessary to change the name, now.  :-)
