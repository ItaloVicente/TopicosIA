DESCRIPTION:

Bug 505330: Unable to post-process imported/migrated RSA-RTE model with proprietary profiles
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=505330

Ensure that, as much as possible, the schema locations for profiles
are resolved when loading the model resources to be migrated, using
the same dependency helper as is used in fixing references later in
the migration process.  But only when the profile URI doesn't actually
seem to exist as is.

Includes JUnit tests with models provided by contributors for
reproduction of the original problem.  Also a bit of refactoring of
existing test infrastructure now that we have another regression
test suite.

This is a small refinement to ensure that we only attempt to automatically map the original EPX references to the imported Papyrus profile when the original EPX wouldn't actually resolve to an existing resource.  So, if the EPX actually is there, then of course it is used as is.

I guess we need to check the final result for this scenario. As I indicated on the Bugzilla, you (with the current solution) bump into some issue if the .epx-file is still available in the workspace. You for example get two UML profile applications, one referencing the old .epx-file and one the new .profile.uml-file. I hope that Patrik can test this in his environment (I myself do not have an environment up to test this).
