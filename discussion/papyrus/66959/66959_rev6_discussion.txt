DESCRIPTION:

Bug 485220: [Architecture] Provide a more modular architecture
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=485220

Implement version management:  PDE API Tooling and Oomph
Version Management.

Introduce two new plug-in projects to manage versioning
using Oomph:

* org.eclipse.papyrus.releng.main.release for the Main
  bundles and features
* org.eclipse.papyrus.releng.dev.release for the Dev Tools

Add new menu actions to the Dev Tools:

* main menu bar:
    * synchronize POM and manifest versions
* Configure context menu on bundle projects and MANIFEST.MF
    * optimize bundle dependencies and re-exports
    * update dependency version ranges to match current workspace
      and PDE target

Fix versioning errors reported by PDE and Oomph.  Ensure proper
version ranges consistent with latest build target.

Optimize the dependencies of all Papyrus Main bundles and Dev Tools.

Remove version- and reexport-checking tests in the BundlesTests that
are now not needed because, on the one hand, we now implement discrete
bundle versioning (managed by PDE/Oomph) and on the other, we now use
re-exports properly to ensure classpath consistency in clients of a
bundle's API.

I've one (inlined) minor remark about the Operations to edit Manifests, and a few questions:

- I see there is a "check.maven.pom" option in each .project file. What does it do? If a Pom is incompatible with the related Manifest, Tycho should fail already, and Project Poms shouldn't contain any specific information that is not duplicated from the manifest
- How has the baseline been generated? I see that the dev release.xml references version 1.1.2, and the main one references 1.1.3. Is that intentional?
- Do we now need Oomph to work on Papyrus? :)

None of these remarks/questions are blocking, so feel free to push this
Line:55, plugins/developer/org.eclipse.papyrus.dev.project.management/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/dev/project/management/internal/operations/OptimizeDependenciesOperation.java -> It would be best to rely on org.eclipse.papyrus.eclipse.project.editors (Which provides high level APIs to manipulate Eclipse Plug-ins metadata), rather than low-level obscure Regex that can't be reused outside this operation. I don't think performances would be an issue, since we've succesfully used the Manifest Editor until now, for workspace-wide refactoring operations. It might have to be improved, but I think it already covers pretty much all the use cases we need

Thanks for the review, Camille.

All that it does is to check that the metadata repeated in the POM and the Eclipse manifest (feature or bundle) are consistent.  That is only the bundle symbolic name and the version.  Yes, Tycho will fail the build anyways, but only after the user has pushed the commit to Gerrit or git and waited a horribly long time for the dependency resolution phase to complete.  :-)

The release.xml is generated automatically by Oomph's versioning project-builder if it doesn't exist.  So, the proper way to maintain it is, at the end of every release, to simply delete the release.xml and release.digest files and let them be re-build with the current (and final) version numbers.  However, as we aren't at the end of the Neon release yet and I need this file to reflect the baseline Mars.x release, I simply replaced all the numbers with what I expect the final version numbers of the Mars release to be (1.1.2 is a mistake that I shall fix).


 > - Do we now need Oomph to work on Papyrus? :)

Not at all.  Without Oomph installed, the versioning project-builder isn't instantiated and all that you will get is the PDE API Tooling builder.  So, there will be some gaps in the validation that is performed in your workspace.

For those using the Oomph setup to manage their installs, however, I did add the Version Management tools to the setup.

Well, I will at least wait for Florian to complete his refactoring before I rebase and push this, and I'll see about the manifest editor utility (more about that in-line).
Line:55, plugins/developer/org.eclipse.papyrus.dev.project.management/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/dev/project/management/internal/operations/OptimizeDependenciesOperation.java -> Yeah, I didn't use those APIs because I was concerned about their interaction with open manifest editors and, in particular, undo/redo.  But my latest iteration did away with undo support, anyways, so I'll look into using these APIs.
