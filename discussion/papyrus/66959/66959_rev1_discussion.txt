DESCRIPTION:

Bug 485220: [Architecture] Provide a more modular architecture
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=485220

Implement version management:  PDE API Tooling and Oomph
Version Management.

Introduce two new plug-in projects to manage versioning
using Oomphs:

* org.eclipse.papyrus.releng.main.release for the Main
  bundles and features
* org.eclipse.papyrus.releng.dev.release for the Dev Tools

Add new menu actions to the Dev Tools:

* main menu bar:
	* synchronize POM and manifest versions
* Configure context menu on bundle projects and MANIFEST.MF
	* optimize bundle dependencies and re-exports
	* update dependency version ranges to match current workspace
	  and PDE target

Fix versioning errors reported by PDE and Oomph.  Ensure proper
version ranges consistent with latest build target.

Optimize the dependencies of all Papyrus Main bundles and Dev Tools.

Remove version- and reexport-checking tests in the BundlesTests that
are now not needed because, on the one hand, we now implement discrete
bundle versioning (managed by PDE/Oomph) and on the other, we now use
re-exports properly to ensure classpath consistency in clients of a
bundle's API.

The commit comment describes (in brief) the changes, but the main motivation of this change is to implement version management of bundles and features for sensible/correct software updates going forward from the Neon release.  This includes:

* updating the bundle version in each release according to the actual nature of the changes.  No more just updating every bundle to the next minor (or major) version but following Eclipse's semantic version best practice guidelines, as validated by PDE API Tools and Oomph
* ensuring consistent classpaths for users of Papyrus bundles by properly re-exporting dependencies that are exposed as API.  This includes acknowledging the APIs that all already are published as de facto API status

Apart from configuring projects for PDE/Oomph version management to check adherence to the guidelines, Included are new tools that should make it very easy for developers to maintain that adherence:

* a tool that analyses the dependencies of a set of selected bundles and optimizes them to (a) re-export the minimal set of dependencies required to cover the APIs that are exposed in the bundle's own API and (b) remove redundant bundle dependencies (that are re-exported by other dependencies)
* a tool that updates all dependencies of the selected bundles to match the current workspace/target version of each dependency (lower bounded by its minor version and upper bounded by its next major version), except for certain known cases of third-party libraries like Guava and ICU4J that don't follow Eclipse's semantic versioning scheme
* a tool that ensures all plug-in and feature POMs match the version declared in the Eclipse manifest of the plug-in or feature

These tools were applied in this Gerrit change to all of the Papyrus Main bundles and features and also the developer tools, to bring them all into conformity with the Eclipse norms.
