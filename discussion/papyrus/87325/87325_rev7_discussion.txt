Works fine. 
 Some comments in the code + some others here: 

- only one dialog to export table, with an additional composite when required to define if the table must be expanded or not.
- the default path, should be the project location, like done for diagram (please reuse (with a small refactoring I think) the dialog used to export diagram).
- For diagrams, the actions is available in the ModelExplorer (menu Export)
- The action is binded on the Eclipse Export Wizard, available from the Project Explorer (with some trouble with the Di View).
- For diagram we have an export all Diagram, but it is maybe not possible for Table because they must be open before the export I think.
Line:24, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/dialog/TreeTableActionSelectionDialog.java -> Only one dialog shown to the user seems be better.
WIth your implementation, you get two dialog : one for the expand or not, and one to browse the directory.

Line:31, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/export/image/PapyrusImageExportBindings.java -> is name useful ? 

the file name will be the table name in your current implementation, isn't it ?

Line:32, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/export/image/PapyrusImageExportBindings.java -> I always get .BMP image by default... useless too ?

Line:49, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/export/image/PapyrusImageExporter.java -> duplicated value with a previous class already commented. 
Useful ? useless ?

Line:43, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/export/streamprovider/PapyrusFileOutputStreamProvider.java -> I think you should provide a patch to NatTable for that.

Line:36, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/preferences/pages/ExportImagePreferencePage.java -> this string must be in a property file

Line:44, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/preferences/pages/ExportImagePreferencePage.java -> this string must be in a property file

Hi Vincent,

As I wrote from the previous email (2 months ago), the export image functions from Model Explorer and Project Explorer is not handled in this patch to simplify the task.

Do you want me to implement it all here?
And please see my comments in the source code also.
Line:24, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/dialog/TreeTableActionSelectionDialog.java -> For tree table: yes, two dialogs are shown.
For normal table: we have only one default file open dialog. The action selection dialog is not shown as there is no need to collapse/expand this kind of table.

Do you want me to create a new dialog which merges the action selection dialog and the file open dialog?

Line:31, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/export/image/PapyrusImageExportBindings.java -> No, it is useful as we could get the information from 
[1] Default file open dialog, or
[2] The configure registry

This is determined by checking the config attribute PapyrusExportConfigAttributes.EXPORT_IMAGE_USE_DEFAULT_NATTABLE_DIALOG

Line:32, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/export/image/PapyrusImageExportBindings.java -> No, it is useful as we could get the information from

Line:49, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/export/image/PapyrusImageExporter.java -> No, this is still useful as it is the default image name for the file open dialog. 

We could get the information from 
[1] Default file open dialog, or
[2] The configure registry

This is determined by checking the config attribute PapyrusExportConfigAttributes.EXPORT_IMAGE_USE_DEFAULT_NATTABLE_DIALOG

Line:43, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/export/streamprovider/PapyrusFileOutputStreamProvider.java -> Yes, you are right, but it is late now as the patch for Nattable has already merged in NatTable1.5, we could do it for the next release of NatTable.

Line:36, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/preferences/pages/ExportImagePreferencePage.java -> Done

Line:44, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/preferences/pages/ExportImagePreferencePage.java -> Done
