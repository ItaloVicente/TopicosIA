Here some remarks.
I would really introduce the groupid org.eclipse.papyrus.test(s)
I would really we follow tycho/maven convention with intermediate poms
There are some stuff that could be removed de ci de là.
Line:7, releng/main-tests/pom.xml -> migrate parent paragrpah before

Line:39, releng/main-tests/pom.xml -> just to be sure where are listed the two junit plugins?
i would mention them here?

Line:41, releng/main-tests/pom.xml -> strange for me
should be only infra and no mention on internal folders if we respect maven/tycho convention

Line:52, releng/main-tests/pom.xml -> creation of pom at editor level that references children plugins

Line:63, releng/main-tests/pom.xml -> items of plugin management could be migrated / fusion with parent one

Line:14, tests/junit/plugins/editor/org.eclipse.papyrus.editor.integration.tests/pom.xml -> when possible add a description

Line:18, tests/junit/plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.suite.tests/pom.xml -> very strnage? why this plugin has this configuration, should be merged upon.

Line:16, tests/junit/plugins/infra/core/pom.xml -> good a description!

Line:11, tests/junit/plugins/infra/internationalization/pom.xml -> may we ointroduce another groupi id, like org.eclipse.papyrus.test
to group all tests when deploying under nexus?

Line:18, tests/junit/plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable.suite.tests/pom.xml -> use pom view plugin to ensure you could remove all stuff

Line:17, tests/junit/plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.suite.tests/pom.xml -> same remarks

Line:22, tests/junit/plugins/infra/pom.xml -> pom here

Line:26, tests/junit/plugins/infra/pom.xml -> pom here

Line:29, tests/junit/plugins/infra/pom.xml -> pom here

Line:38, tests/junit/plugins/infra/pom.xml -> pom here

Line:42, tests/junit/plugins/infra/pom.xml -> pom here should have shwon you can group them !

Line:16, tests/junit/plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.suite.tests/pom.xml -> same

Line:14, tests/junit/plugins/uml/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.nattable.suite.tests/pom.xml -> same

Line:21, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.suite.tests/pom.xml -> same

Line:18, tests/junit/plugins/uml/pom.xml -> introduce intermediate pom, pelase

Line:14, tests/junit/plugins/uml/textedit/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.textedit.suite.tests/pom.xml -> same

Line:7, releng/main-tests/pom.xml -> I will adapt the poms to respect the maven structure convention. Thanks, I was not aware of this convention before :)

Line:39, releng/main-tests/pom.xml -> We already depend on dev that include those but I can add them here. assuming you are talking about the two papyrus.junit plugins.

Line:41, releng/main-tests/pom.xml -> yes you are right, I was not thinking properly. only the top poms should be mentioned here.

Line:52, releng/main-tests/pom.xml -> ditto

Line:63, releng/main-tests/pom.xml -> yes a good part of them seem to be shared between poms ! will do !

Line:14, tests/junit/plugins/editor/org.eclipse.papyrus.editor.integration.tests/pom.xml -> will do :)

Line:18, tests/junit/plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.suite.tests/pom.xml -> Looking closer there are properties that are shared among all the suites that can be moved up to the parent pom. On the other hand the testClass needs to remain there for the execution of the test suites.

Line:16, tests/junit/plugins/infra/core/pom.xml -> \o/

Line:11, tests/junit/plugins/infra/internationalization/pom.xml -> yes I think that's a very good idea ! thanks !

Line:18, tests/junit/plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable.suite.tests/pom.xml -> again, oversight, thanks for the review :)

Line:17, tests/junit/plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.suite.tests/pom.xml -> ditto

Line:22, tests/junit/plugins/infra/pom.xml -> I'll add intermediary poms to the folders

Line:26, tests/junit/plugins/infra/pom.xml -> ditto

Line:29, tests/junit/plugins/infra/pom.xml -> ditto

Line:38, tests/junit/plugins/infra/pom.xml -> ditto
