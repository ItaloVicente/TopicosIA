Patch Set 2:

Strangely, now all 3 files have line ending changed
when looking at the diff under gerrit,
so the situation is worth than for patch set #1 with that respect.
As for collection copy, this is better as there now is only one useless copy, and I won't argue any further since I don't want to delay integration of this correction.
However, I still think that the interface ILinkMappingHelper  should be revisited to use List<?> instead of Collection<?>,
 since nothing in the implementation prevents it,
 and some clients assume some ordering anyway.

I just changed my configuration on Eclipse to ignore whitespace.
I agree with you about the interface ILinkMappingHelper, it should use List<?> instead of Collection<?>. This fix could be made later.
