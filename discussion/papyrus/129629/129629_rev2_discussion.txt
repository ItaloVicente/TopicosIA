DESCRIPTION:

Bug 536633 - [Sequence Diagram] EditParts based on DurationLinkFigure
should provide custom selection points

- reconnection handles for the Start/Target anchors
- selection handles at the intersection points between each  line
- horizontal/vertical move handle in the middle of the arrow line
- Bug 536634 - add a DragPolicy for the move handle that moves the arrow
horizontally/vertically, based on its orientation

It's looking good! I've gone through a more thorough code review now, so here are my comments :)
Line:2, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/edit/parts/CustomDurationConstraintLinkEditPart.java -> Copyright should include CEA (CEA LIST, EclipseSource and others) (This applies to all new classes)

Line:44, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/edit/parts/CustomDurationConstraintLinkEditPart.java -> This edit part (And the one for DurationObservation) needs to install a Notation listener, in order to react to Named Style value changes and refresh its Figure. Otherwise, undo-redo won't work properly (Moving the arrow line then undoing -> The arrow line is not properly refreshed)

(I'll send you a code snippet separately for how to achieve this)

Line:62, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/edit/policies/DurationLinkSelectionHandlesEditPolicy.java -> I think SelectionHandlesEditPolicy is for Nodes. Connections use the ConnectionEndpointEditPolicy (Which support Anchor points and Bendpoints - although we don't want bendpoints in that case)

It may be the reason why Reconnect doesn't show live feedback anymore

See PapyrusConnectionEndEditPolicy (installed on the EditPolicy.CONNECTION_ENDPOINTS_ROLE role)

Extending the ConnectionEndpoint edit policy, you should be able to inherit their reconnect handles, and just add the selection/move ones to the list

Line:214, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/edit/policies/DurationLinkSelectionHandlesEditPolicy.java -> There's a trick here: Named Styles are compatible with CSS, which means that if a CSS exists and declares the "delta" property, the IntValueStyle will be non-null. However, it would be a transient style, so any changes to that style would be ignored.

Since we want this value to be user-driven (And not CSS-driven), you need to iterate on the View's style list manually (Instead of using the getNamedStyle method)

Line:219, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/edit/policies/DurationLinkSelectionHandlesEditPolicy.java -> Another trick (This can be reported as a separate, follow-up bug, and doesn't have to be fixed now): the moveDelta is in absolute screen coordinates, which doesn't account for the current Zoom. So if your zoom level is != 100%, the result position won't be correct

Line:238, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/edit/policies/DurationLinkSelectionHandlesEditPolicy.java -> This constant will probably have to be fully public (Declared in a public class) in order to support proper live-feedback (But that's probably a follow-up issue :) )

So I would move the Request to its own class. A public request class will also be required to provide tests

Line:30, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/handlers/DurationLinkEndpointHandle.java -> This class is not used anymore
