DESCRIPTION:

Bug 536633 - [Sequence Diagram] EditParts based on DurationLinkFigure
should provide custom selection points

- reconnection handles for the Start/Target anchors
- selection handles at the intersection points between each  line
- horizontal/vertical move handle in the middle of the arrow line
- Bug 536634 - add a DragPolicy for the move handle that moves the arrow
horizontally/vertically, based on its orientation

The 'reconnect' part is redundant with Bug 536639 / 537724 and may introduce conflicts (I guess the ticket was confusing; it was just about adding the handle points, to "show" selection, not actually implement the interactions. The follow-up Bug 536634 was about implementing the move so that's fine; but we initially didn't want to support reconnection at all, for Duration Links)

In general, the changes should apply to both DurationConstraint and DurationObservation links
Line:32, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/command/ReconnectTargetConstraintCommand.java -> Reconnect was already supported in Bug 537724 / 536639 :)

Line:60, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/edit/policies/DurationConstraintLinkSelectionHandlesEditPolicy.java -> Should be renamed to DurationLinkSelectionHandlesEditPolicy and work with both DurationConstraint and DurationObservation links

Line:88, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/edit/policies/DurationConstraintLinkSelectionHandlesEditPolicy.java -> The hand cursor is confusing. SizeWE or SizeNS (Depending on the arrow orientation) would be better

Line:48, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/handlers/DurationConstraintLinkEndpointHandle.java -> Should be renamed to DurationLinkEndpointHandle (It should work with both DurationConstraintLink and DurationObservationLink)

Line:26, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/requests/MoveRequest.java -> I like the generic MoveRequest, but naming should be different. GMF already provides a (semantic) MoveRequest and GEF has a REQ_MOVE request type (in RequestConstants), so that would be confusing. Moreover, this new MoveRequest is not so generic in practice, since it's used only by custom figures.

Maybe we can extend GEF's ChangeBoundsRequest and just use custom request types? (We'd lose Java 5 generics in method signatures though :) )

Line:60, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/src-gen/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/edit/parts/DurationConstraintLinkEditPart.java -> Modifying generated code is risky. We should extend the EditParts (with a CustomDurationConstraintLinkEditPart), and instantiate these custom parts in org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence.providers.CustomEditPartProvider

Also, DurationObservationLinkEditPart should be modified in the same way
