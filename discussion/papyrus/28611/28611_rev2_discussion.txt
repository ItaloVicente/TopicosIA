DESCRIPTION:

Bug 424049: Forward Papyrus editor notifications to Eclipse platform

The Eclipse Platform UI needs to be notified when changes happen within
the Papyrus multi-editor.

As an example, the CDT maintains an internal cache of the active AST.
This cache is updated by watching for editor activations and changes to
the editor input.

AbstractMultiPageSashEditor was not forwarding these events when changes
are made.  The particular case that causes problems for the CDT AST
Cache is that the PageInput changes are not broadcast.  In the following
sequence, two different PageInputs would be returned:

    AbstractMultiPageSashEditor multiEditor;
    IEditorInput i1 = multiEditor.getActiveEditor().getEditorInput();
    // ... select a new tab
    IEditorInput i2 = multiEditor.getActiveEditor().getEditorInput();

The AbstractMultiPageSashEditor needs to send a property change
notification for PROP_INPUT.

This patch implements this notification in the SashWindowsContainer
since this is the component that holds the editors (as well as the
active one).

I've also changed the visibility of a method in
AbstractMultiPageSashEditor to make it accessible from the Sash
container.

See Bug 423679 for a related CDT change.  Neither of these changes have
build dependencies on each other.  However, both changes are needed in
order to properly implement CDT Editor navigation (F3, etc.) within the
Papyrus editor.
