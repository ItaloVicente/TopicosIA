DESCRIPTION:

Bug 424049: Forward Papyrus editor notifications to Eclipse platform

The Eclipse Platform UI needs to be notified when changes happen within
the Papyrus multi-editor.

As an example, the CDT maintains an internal cache of the active AST.
This cache is updated by watching for editor activations and changes to
the editor input.

AbstractMultiPageSashEditor was not forwarding these events when changes
are made.  The particular case that causes problems for the CDT AST
Cache is that the PageInput changes are not broadcast.  In the following
sequence, two different PageInputs would be returned:

    AbstractMultiPageSashEditor multiEditor;
    IEditorInput i1 = multiEditor.getActiveEditor().getEditorInput();
    // ... select a new tab
    IEditorInput i2 = multiEditor.getActiveEditor().getEditorInput();

The AbstractMultiPageSashEditor needs to send a property change
notification for PROP_INPUT.

This patch implements this notification in the SashWindowsContainer
since this is the component that holds the editors (as well as the
active one).

I've also changed the visibility of a method in
AbstractMultiPageSashEditor to make it accessible from the Sash
container.

See Bug 423679 for a related CDT change.  Neither of these changes have
build dependencies on each other.  However, both changes are needed in
order to properly implement CDT Editor navigation (F3, etc.) within the
Papyrus editor.

The patch is fine for me. However, since it modifies the core notification mechanisms, I'd like to let Camille have a look.

  You should not les SashWindowsContainer know about AbstractMultiPageSashEditor. This introduce a circular dependency.
    AbstractMultiPageSashEditor know SashWindowsContainer, but the opposite is false !
    
  So, you should use an observer/observe pattern:
  SashWindowsContainer is the observe. You can listen to the required event.
  AbstractMultiPageSashEditor is the observer: it register itself to SashWindowsContainer for the required event. 
    In the same time, you do not need to change the visibility of the method: it will be called by AbstractMultiPageSashEditor itself.
Line:98, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/editor/AbstractMultiPageSashEditor.java -> You can let if protected, and use the observer/observe pattern (see comment in SashWindowsContainer)

Line:29, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/internal/SashWindowsContainer.java -> You introduce a circular dependency between the 2 classes.
SashWindowsContainer should not know AbstractMultiPageSashEditor. The opposite can be done.

Line:448, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/internal/SashWindowsContainer.java -> You should not call AbstractMultiPageSashEditor directly !!

Instead, you should use an observer/observee pattern:
SashWindowsContainer is the observe, firing your required event. 
AbstractMultiPageSashEditor can then observe for such event, and call your required method.

Ok.

Where should the register part go?  I.e., against which component should SashWindowsContainer register to receive the notifications?
