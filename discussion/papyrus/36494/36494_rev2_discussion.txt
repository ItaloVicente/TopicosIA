This review is so big that it breaks Gerrit  :-)

The subject at hand is ostensibly integration of MWE2 workflow execution and Xtend compilation for the oep.infra.gmfdiag.css plug-in, but there are a great many files changed in other unrelated plug-ins (just line endings or encoding changed?).  Also, the CSS plug-in itself was renamed/refactored, resulting in lots of files moved.  Why?  This makes it very difficult to review the change.

Can we take this a step at a time, starting by just factoring out the specific releng changes needed for integration of MWE2 and Xtend into the build for this plug-in?  Also, I thought the purpose overall was to provide some shared POM that would make it easy to integrate MWE2 and Xtend into any plug-in.  Quite possibly I'm missing some context for this review that would make it more clear to me what the intent is.
Line:23, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/xtext/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> In my diagram assistants branch, I found this step (as suggested in the Xtend documentation) wasn't necessary because the Tycho compiler constructs its classpath from the JDT metadata.  The example in the Xtend documentation was for a plain Java (not Eclipse/Tycho) scenario.

Line:1, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/xtext/pom.xml -> I don't really understand what the plugin management in this POM is doing.  

And is this file just intended as a temporary stage for stuff that should be moved into the top POM?  We don't have a hierarchical module structure currently in Papyrus ...

Line:1, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/xtext/src/site/site.xml -> What is the purpose of this file?

Line:2, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/xtext/src/site/xdoc/description.xdoc -> What is the purpose of this file?  It looks like a generated template waiting to be completed ...

Hi Christian,

Did you also check commits that were already merged in the branch ? see
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/owner:%22Francois+Le+Fevre%22+branch:%22bugs/447580-codeGen%22+status:merged,n,z

It will probably explain some changes. The original work was to generate emf at the correct maven build cycle.
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/36009/

=> For example : François had to move up the configuration since the generation is on 3 plugins and group them as a maven module
(which makes for me more sense than just sharing the same naming convention)

The first version 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT of the emf generator was finished the 6 November and IMHO should have been reviewed and merged in master at that time. Instead this branch has been created to save the work and all future work on automatic generation binded on maven life-cycle.

I strongly believe that this kind of work is really important to move Papyrus on the next step of model driven development:
 - removing generated files from git repository
 - binding all generations to a the correct life-cycle
 - avoid any manual generation 

Regards,
Benoit

No, I was reviewing this Gerrit change on its own terms, as usual.

I'm interested in the compilation of Xtend sources, which is the purpose of this current Gerrit change.

Okay, but so far we have been putting all common build configuration in the top POM.  Why not in this case?  Or are we free now to introduce more POM hierarchy for other purposes?  That would be fine with me; I just thought that was not currently policy.  Also, I'm concerned that we're adding POM files that aren't maintained within the Eclipse projects and are therefore not easily managed within the Eclipse environment (they are only accessible in the Git directories).  For example, there isn't a plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/xtext/.project file to create an Eclipse project that makes the pom.xml accessible within Eclipse.

Any comment on the site.xml and xdoc files that look like auto-generated stubs?  AFAIK, we don't use these in Papyrus.  And all of the files that are changed in plug-ins that aren't generated?

What I was hoping to see was common infrastructure that I could re-use in my own Xtend projects to simplify their build configuration (which, granted, isn't exactly complex:  the xtend-maven-plugin is quite simple).  I don't see much of a common infrastructure here that I can understand, or it's hard to find in the large number of changes.  I can't review this until it's cleaned up.

About the current review don't forget that its on a branch and that a squashing (reorder/merge...) phase is expected before merging in master

About site.xml and xdoc : 
they are used by the "mvn site" command 
=> it should ease the doc/site generation (ex javadoc)
but it's an other subject than xtend generation. 

About structure for pom.xml files :
I didn't find any "official" policy on the subject in papyrus wiki (Maybe I missed it ? Is there a wiki page referencing official collegiate decisions ? )
Indeed all pom.xml are currently on the same level as a .project file, but I believe that we should change that.
 - you can change the pom.xml with eclipse directly in the git repository view. Or you can use the import new project wizard.
 - Currently the top-pom* files are holding an exhaustive list of all Papyrus plugins. It shouldn't be the case. For example : extra plugins would be easier to manage if each of them were providing an independent top-pom. (Which will also allow to build them independently)
 
*****On a more practical view, this is what I suggest : *******
 - create independent bugs for each generation type
 - create a bug for publishing good website from each plugins with maven/tycho 
 - create a bug for the structure of pom.xml
 - push gerrit contribution to MASTER that will be reviewed by everyone (especially you :))
 - treat the subjects in this order : xtend, emf, site, mw2
 - drop the branch as soon as the reports to other gerrit review are done (since only branch with active work should be kept alive)
=> It will re-focus the discussion on the subjects.

Do you agree ?

Yes, but most of the files changed here would not want to be merged to master because they have nothing to do with integrating any kind of code generation into the build system.  So, the merge to master must not include those changes, so best not to implement them on the branch in the first place.  The purpose of any useful branch is eventually to merge it to master, so the same rigor should be applied to every branch as would be applied to master.

> About site.xml and xdoc :

Yes, but currently they are empty or at least they look like generated templates.

Are we proposing to start publishing Maven project sites to Eclipse.org?  Will that help us to include Javadocs in the Papyrus SDK Developer Guide plug-in?  That would be nice.

RIght, it is.  Which is why it shouldn't be in this Gerrit change.  :-)

> About structure for pom.xml files :

Not that I know of.  There's just the pattern established when Tycho was first implemented in Papyrus and some discussions on the mailing list and conference calls that I remember (or perhaps misremember).  Anyways, I certainly don't object to changing the module structure if it can help improve matters, but it would be nice to see any changes implemented consistently throughout the repository.

Yes, that's a good point.  This provides full access to the Git filesystem.  I tend to forget that because I only use EGit for the History View.  :-)

I agree.  These POMs need to be better modularized, and not just because of the number of times I've had to manually merge them because they're a central locus of change!  The same can be said for the JUnit AllTests suite (I've actually implemented something on my branch to help modularize that one).

> *****On a more practical view, this is what I suggest : *******

Agreed.

> - create a bug for publishing good website from each plugins with maven/tycho

I'll be interested to see what the enhancement bugzilla says about the motivation for this.

> - create a bug for the structure of pom.xml

Agreed.

Agreed.

> (especially you :))

Yes, I can volunteer. :-)

Why would mwe2 not be a higher priority than the site?  It's a code-generation concern.

Agreed.

Yep.

> 
> Do you agree ?

Absolutely!  Thanks very much for taking the time to discuss this and proposing what I think is the right way forward.  It will definitely help us to make progress on all of these fronts.
