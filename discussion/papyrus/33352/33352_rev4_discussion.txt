DESCRIPTION:

Bug 443826 - Resizing/moving of a combined fragment works incorrectly in
zoomed-in/zoomed-out view.

Fixed:
- Expanding a combined fragment expands inner opperands more than it is
expected.
- Expanding an operand leads to the combined fragment being expanded as
expected but the operand is expanded even more.
