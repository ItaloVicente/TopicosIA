Thanks for this patch. It works well and fixes the intended bug. However I'm a bit concerned about the design choices made here. 
The command definitions and handlers for the "control" and "uncontrol" actions have been moved to the oep.views.modelexplorer plugin.
There is thus a new dependency in oep.infra.services.controlmode towards oep.views.modelexplorer. IMHO services should be as independent as possible, specially from view components.
What do others think about this?

> What do others think about this?

The control mode is a core service, so I prefer that the Model Explorer (UI) depends on it, rather than the opposite. Ideally, controlled resources should be an orthogonal issue, but in practice this doesn't really work. So, I'm fine with this approach

(Note, I +2 based on Juan's comment, but I didn't review the behavior)
