Thanks for double-checking that, Nicolas.  I hope it's not inconvenient the way these patches are stacked on top of one another.  If you prefer, I can provide patches in parallel.  I'm only doing it this way to try to spare you having to deal with merge conflicts (which are anticipated as these bugs are generally all in the same vicinity of the code).
