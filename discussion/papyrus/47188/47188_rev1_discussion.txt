DESCRIPTION:

Bug 465416: Synchronization of diagrams with other diagrams
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=465416

Initial prototype of a sync API with example implementation for synchronization of
class diagrams for UML-RT Capsules by Laurent Wouters, subsequently elaborated as
described herein by Christian W. Damus.

API refactorings and fixes:

* factor out common dispatcher management
* node-size sync did not account for default (-1, -1) size in notation model
* (RT example) set up synchronization of corresponding views that already exist
  in a sync slave package
* exception bullet-proofing (finally clauses)

Implement a Papyrus service for the integration of the model synchronization
framework.  This also removes the need for pervasive tracking of synchronization
components by weak references because they are scoped within a service instance.

Define synchronization styles for diagram views and a synchronization trigger
to activate synchronization on opening a diagram editor.

Exemplary implementation of diagram synchronization in UML-RT, replacing the
original contribution's oep.umlrt.diagrams plug-in:

* synchronization of capsule state machine with the inherited state machine
* state machine diagram synchronization, except for connection points and
  connection point references.

This is a refactoring/elaboration of the original prototype submitted as Change 36747.  In particular, the example of synchronization of UML-RT class diagrams showing capsules is replaced by a prototype of inherited state-machine synchronization for capsules.

DISCLAIMER:  I do not know what the intended semantics of this state-machine synchronization are supposed to be, so this should be taken as a demonstrative prototype only and revised/elaborated further by a domain expert.

This change set implements the functionality presented in the latest demo video:

     https://youtu.be/BKYe8b84ywM

This is the core API that should be integrated for M7 if we want to ship it in the Mars release, but the feature overall is not complete.  Outstanding work items include:

* implementation of synchronization of element and view deletion in state machines for UML-RT (and testing thereof).  Currently, synchronization of existing and new elements seems to work
* implementation of diagram styles and/or other mechanism for overriding/disabling notational synchronization of select views in a diagram
* implementation of some mechanism to override/disable synchronization of select elements in the semantic model (if this is actually required)
* automated tests
Line:126, extraplugins/umlrt/org.eclipse.papyrus.umlrt.ui/plugin.xml -> We may want to consider commenting this extension out until the implementation is either verified or updated to match the behaviour that we want for UML-RT capsule state-machine diagram synchronization.

Line:72, extraplugins/umlrt/org.eclipse.papyrus.umlrt/plugin.xml -> We may want to consider commenting this extension out until the implementation is either verified or updated to match the behaviour that we want for UML-RT capsule state-machine diagram synchronization.  (the other triggers are only invoked by this one, so commenting this out would cut them out, too)
