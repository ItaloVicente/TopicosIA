DESCRIPTION:

Bug 465416: Synchronization of diagrams with other diagrams
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=465416

Initial prototype of a sync API with example implementation for synchronization of
class diagrams for UML-RT Capsules by Laurent Wouters, subsequently elaborated as
described herein by Christian W. Damus.

API refactorings and fixes:

* factor out common dispatcher management
* node-size sync did not account for default (-1, -1) size in notation model
* (RT example) set up synchronization of corresponding views that already exist
  in a sync slave package
* delete stuff from the diagram by removing views from the notation model, not
  edit parts from their parents
* exception bullet-proofing (finally clauses)

Implement a Papyrus service for the integration of the model synchronization
framework.

Define synchronization styles for diagram views and a synchronization trigger
to activate synchronization on opening a diagram editor.

Exemplary implementation of diagram synchronization in UML-RT, replacing the
original contribution's oep.umlrt.diagrams plug-in:

* synchronization of capsule state machine with the inherited state machine
* state machine diagram synchronization, except for connection points and
  connection point references.

Patch Set 5:

Pats set 4 fixes basic problems in the deletion of nodes from the sub-capsule's state machine diagram when elements are deleted from the super-capsule's state machine:

* once elements have been deleted, there is no traceability between sub- and super-state-machine elements in the semantic model, so that needs to be cached
* once views have been deleted, they no longer remember their semantic elements, so that needs to be cached
* the original prototype's implementation of view deletion from the diagram simply removed edit-parts from their parents, which doesn't work.  It is necessary to remove the views from the notation model, which naturally results in the edit-parts being removed (simply removing edit-parts doesn't work because they are always recreated to support the notation model)
