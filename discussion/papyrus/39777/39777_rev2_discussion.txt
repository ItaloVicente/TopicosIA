DESCRIPTION:

Bug 456770: [UML RT] Papyrus shall support a protocol editor

1. Using resource set listener to create required protocol elements when
protocol container is created. 
2. Integrate protocol editor to UML-RT properties page so users do not
need to open new dialog. Extended multiple reference editor in order to
support drag and drop capability.

Users won't need to touch anything other than the protocol container.

Hi,

I managed to follow your tutorial.
https://selrahcsoftconsult.clarify-it.com/d/j6lfkw
Note that I didn't do the step 5, the  package was automatically created after adding the stereotype in step 4.

I have the following problem : 
 - select a <<Protocol container >>
 - add 2 in operation : test1 and test2
 - select test2
 - press the up button 2 times
-> test2 disappear

Also undo redo are not working on the same use case.

All the problems you reported comes from the papyrus framework not from my code. I used MultiReferenceEditor and that's where all the transactions are done like adding/moving/deleting the operations. Undo/redo doesn't seem to work well either with transactions done from this editor.

Hi,

Sorry I didn't know that. Do you have the reference of the bug you are talking about? If no can you create one please :)

Since It's working well for me, I made some comments about structure and code in your classes.

Thanks for your work

Line:13, extraplugins/umlrt/org.eclipse.papyrus.umlrt.properties/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/umlrt/properties/modelelement/UMLRTExtModelElementFactory.java -> Do we really want to return null it it's not an Element ? 
=> if yes cahnge the message in the log
=> if no move the test to line 20

Also can you add a standard Cea & other header
(I know it's missing from the previous commit )

Line:109, extraplugins/umlrt/org.eclipse.papyrus.umlrt.properties/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/umlrt/properties/protocoleditor/MultipleReferenceEditorWithDnDSupport.java -> missing //$NON-NLS-1$

Line:35, extraplugins/umlrt/org.eclipse.papyrus.umlrt.ui/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/umlrt/ui/protocol/UMLRTProtocolUtil.java -> This class is a "semantic" one  
=> it should be moved in a "semantic" plugin (not a ui one) 
=> currently the only one is org.eclipse.papyrus.umlrt  
(create a new src source directory and utils package) 

All method in utility class should be public static  
also add a private constructor to avoid instantiation  
Extract all constants to an interface (ex: UMLRealTime::Protocol ...)
