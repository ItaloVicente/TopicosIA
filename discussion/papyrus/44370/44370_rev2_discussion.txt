DESCRIPTION:

Bug 425565 - [Model Explorer] Cannot create certain relationships in
model explorer, specifically UML Dependency
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=425565

org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild
- added a new element (CreateRelationshipMenu) for relationships in
elementCreationMenuModel.ecore
- Update the CreationMenuFactory to handle creating createcommands based
on CreateRelationshipMenu
- Added SetTargetAndRelationshipCommand wrapper command for creating
relationships from the model explorer.

org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer.newchild
 - changed the build command to use creationMenu rather than the
elementType directly

org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.service.types.test
- Added several unit tests to CreateReationshipTest
- Added severaltest elements to the TestModel.uml needed by the tests

some comments on current code
Line:10, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> We try not to reexport package from required bundles to keep clear dependencies.

Line:24, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> There should be a bundle-version="1.1.0" here for Papyrus dependency

Line:36, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> We avoid package import, we prefer to rely on the Required-Bundle instead, to have clear dependencies.

Line:177, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/newchild/CreationMenuFactory.java -> Avoid casting without checking before. This is better to handle the test in the code thatn trying to fix later when there is a ClassCastException, and someone else tries to understand the code.

Line:339, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/newchild/CreationMenuFactory.java -> It would be nice to test that the element type is not null there. This would avoid NPE, and there could be a wrong definition of the Identifier in the creation menu model, or the element type could be not loaded yet (runtime load/unload of element types)

Line:392, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.newchild/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/newchild/CreationMenuFactory.java -> You should not assume there you have a NamedElement. EObject should be enough. You can retrieve the label provider service from it, and the root object can be retrieved from the EObject also

Line:37, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.service.types/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> There should be also here the version numbers
