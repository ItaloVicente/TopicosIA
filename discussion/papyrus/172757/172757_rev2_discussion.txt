DESCRIPTION:

Merge branch 'bugs/568853-match-and-apply' into bugs/568494-toolsmiths-dev

Refactoring of the core Element Types Configurations model to unify the
configurations owned by an element type in one containment reference with
subsets to distinguish the different configuration roles:

- owned advice of any element type configuration
- matcher of a specialization type configuration
- edit-helper of a specialization type configuration
- container constraint of a specialization type configuration

This additionally simplifies the EMF.Edit providers for the
AbstractAdviceBindingConfiguration::owningTarget reference that now is a subset of
the inherited owningType reference.

Further changes:

- regenerate models that extend the Element Types Configurations core model.
- export StereotypeMatcher.ecore model to UML and use the UML as generator source
- add a class that specializes both StereotypeApplicationMatcherConfiguration and
  AbstractAdviceBindingConfiguration to fulfill both roles
- register matcher and advice factories to instantiate matcher and advice
  implementations from the new configuration
- JUnit test coverage of new matcher-advice configuration
- fix drag-and-drop for owned advices
- create wrappers to identify the multiple roles of StereotypeMatcherAdviceConfiguration
- ensure that deletion of owned configurations should deletes from the superset
- fix the diagram to use GMF Text instead of UML Comments to show subsets constraints.
- fix the ordering of children features in the ElementTypeSetConfiguration to
  be as previously.
- ensure preferred ordering of advice children in the editor tree

Patch Set 2:

Patch set 2 adds custom code to the edit providers to ensure our preferred ordering of advice relative to other children in the tree editor. And it lets saves the reconciled genmodel that would break the ordering without that custom code (other diffs in the edit providers are due to regeneration of that change).

Line:150, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types.edit/src-gen/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/types/provider/ElementTypeSetConfigurationItemProvider.java -> If I understand correctly, these 2 lines of code will be swapped when the model is regenerated; but getChildrenFeatures() below will ensure that, at runtime, the features are ordered correctly?
I ask because I see some code changes in the generated code; but if I understand correctly, the generated order shouldn't matter anymore (At least for ElementTypes/Matchers)

Line:150, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types.edit/src-gen/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/types/provider/ElementTypeSetConfigurationItemProvider.java -> Essentially, yes. I regenerated the model, so these two lines are already in the "wrong" order. Thus, regeneration should now be stable via-à-vis the code, and the re-ordering work-around makes a nice experience in the editor.
