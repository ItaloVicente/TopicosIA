DESCRIPTION:

Merge branch 'bugs/568853-match-and-apply' into bugs/568494-toolsmiths-dev

Refactoring of the core Element Types Configurations model to unify the
configurations owned by an element type in one containment reference with
subsets to distinguish the different configuration roles:

- owned advice of any element type configuration
- matcher of a specialization type configuration
- edit-helper of a specialization type configuration
- container constraint of a specialization type configuration

This additionally simplifies the EMF.Edit providers for the
AbstractAdviceBindingConfiguration::owningTarget reference that now is a subset of
the inherited owningType reference.

Further changes:

- regenerate models that extend the Element Types Configurations core model.
- export StereotypeMatcher.ecore model to UML and use the UML as generator source
- add a class that specializes both StereotypeApplicationMatcherConfiguration and
  AbstractAdviceBindingConfiguration to fulfill both roles
- register matcher and advice factories to instantiate matcher and advice
  implementations from the new configuration
- JUnit test coverage of new matcher-advice configuration
- fix drag-and-drop for owned advices
- create wrappers to identify the multiple roles of StereotypeMatcherAdviceConfiguration
- ensure that deletion of owned configurations should deletes from the superset
- fix the diagram to use GMF Text instead of UML Comments to show subsets constraints.
- fix the ordering of children features in the ElementTypeSetConfiguration to
  be as previously.

The changes look good to me :+1:

Since you already did some references reordering; can we maybe move the Matcher above the Advices? Matcher has a single value, and can also be an advice, so it would avoid inserting elements in the middle of the list. Especially, if we add the "ApplyAndMatchStereotype" Advice/Matcher, and then additional advices, they appear between the two occurrences of the Advice/Matcher element, which feels a bit weird.

Thanks for the review!

I agree. The difficulty is that the ownedAdvice reference is inherited by SpecializationTypeConfiguration from ElementTypeConfiguration, so the order cannot be specified in the genmodel (I wish the genmodel allowed to override the inherited GenReference so that it could be ordered differently in the subclass, but that could only apply to the EMF.Edit layer (not the model code generation because the feature ID cannot be redefined) so I understand why this limitation is imposed).

I'll have to re-order dynamically in the item provider. Which also then can fix the problem of advice and types ordering in the set so that we needn't worry about regressions in that from re-generation.
