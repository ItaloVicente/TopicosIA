DESCRIPTION:

Merge branch 'bugs/568853-match-and-apply' into bugs/568494-toolsmiths-dev

Refactoring of the core Element Types Configurations model to unify the
configurations owned by an element type in one containment reference with
subsets to distinguish the different configuration roles:

- owned advice of any element type configuration
- matcher of a specialization type configuration
- edit-helper of a specialization type configuration
- container constraint of a specialization type configuration

This additionally simplifies the EMF.Edit providers for the
AbstractAdviceBindingConfiguration::owningTarget reference that now is a subset of
the inherited owningType reference.

Further changes:

- regenerate models that extend the Element Types Configurations core model.
- export StereotypeMatcher.ecore model to UML and use the UML as generator source
- add a class that specializes both StereotypeApplicationMatcherConfiguration and
  AbstractAdviceBindingConfiguration to fulfill both roles
- register matcher and advice factories to instantiate matcher and advice
  implementations from the new configuration
- JUnit test coverage of new matcher-advice configuration
- fix drag-and-drop for owned advices
- create wrappers to identify the multiple roles of StereotypeMatcherAdviceConfiguration
- ensure that deletion of owned configurations should deletes from the superset
- fix the diagram to use GMF Text instead of UML Comments to show subsets constraints.
- fix the ordering of children features in the ElementTypeSetConfiguration to
  be as previously.
- ensure preferred ordering of advice children in the editor tree
- use mask label style for subsets instead of GMF Text shapes

From code review:
- handle case of profile identity implied by stereotype qualified names
- fix advice not finding the CreateElementRequest to approve
- add test cases for rejection of CreateElementRequest

Thanks, Camille, for finding that profile URI case. Patch set 4 addresses this and adds Unit test cases to cover inapplicable stereotypes of two kinds:

- the profile URI is specified by the matcher-advice and that profile is not applied
- the profile URI is not specified, but some stereotype named by the matcher-advice is not applicable

What further review do we need before we can merge this to the feature branch?
