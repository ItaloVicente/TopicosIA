DESCRIPTION:

Merge branch 'bugs/568853-match-and-apply' into bugs/568494-toolsmiths-dev

Refactoring of the core Element Types Configurations model to unify the
configurations owned by an element type in one containment reference with
subsets to distinguish the different configuration roles:

- owned advice of any element type configuration
- matcher of a specialization type configuration
- edit-helper of a specialization type configuration
- container constraint of a specialization type configuration

This additionally simplifies the EMF.Edit providers for the
AbstractAdviceBindingConfiguration::owningTarget reference that now is a subset of
the inherited owningType reference.

Further changes:

- regenerate models that extend the Element Types Configurations core model.
- export StereotypeMatcher.ecore model to UML and use the UML as generator source
- add a class that specializes both StereotypeApplicationMatcherConfiguration and
  AbstractAdviceBindingConfiguration to fulfill both roles
- register matcher and advice factories to instantiate matcher and advice
  implementations from the new configuration
- JUnit test coverage of new matcher-advice configuration
- fix drag-and-drop for owned advices
- create wrappers to identify the multiple roles of StereotypeMatcherAdviceConfiguration
- ensure that deletion of owned configurations should deletes from the superset
- fix the diagram to use GMF Text instead of UML Comments to show subsets constraints.
- fix the ordering of children features in the ElementTypeSetConfiguration to
  be as previously.
- ensure preferred ordering of advice children in the editor tree
- use mask label style for subsets instead of GMF Text shapes

Patch Set 3:

I have discovered that the mask label style can be employed to show the subsetting constraints of an association end (albeit only with the unique and ordered constraints also). So patch set 3 employs that mechanism now instead of GMF Text shapes to show subsetting in the Element Types Configurations package diagram.

Line:69, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.types.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/types/core/matchers/stereotype/StereotypeMatcherEditHelperAdvice.java -> One thing I noticed while working on the generator update: if the profileURI is null, we should accept the change (As long as the Stereotype QualifiedName is applicable, this is fine). By default, we don't rely on the profileURI; only the qualified name.
