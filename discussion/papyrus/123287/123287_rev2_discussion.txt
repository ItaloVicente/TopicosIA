DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533683: [Sequence Diagram] Deletion of the last InteractionOperand

In the diagram, deletion of a multiple selection obtains a deletion
command separately from each selected edit-part, entirely within its
own context.  There is no reasonable way to share a single
InteractionContainerDeletionContext amongst these separate requests
that will not break other situations, so instead of pre-computing
the advice command that deletes the CombinedFragment when it will be
left without any operands, this decision is deferred to the actual
point of execution of an after advice.
