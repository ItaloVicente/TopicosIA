DESCRIPTION:

Bug 534972 - [Designer] Code generation should not delete files prior to code generation

- New interface ICleanUntouched that can be implemented by a file-access class. It allows the
  selective deletion of elements that have not been touched by the generator
- Don't overwrite files with identical content. The comparison uses a function in apache.commons.io
  => new dependency to this plugin
- An additional patch for SW designer will be done in order to implement the desired functions
  based on new capabilities in infra.tools.file
