DESCRIPTION:

Bug 511917 - [Model import] update the model import tool to produce a
Port_NameLabel view without an explicit set of element

* the toLabel() mapping that creates the DecorationNode PortNameLabel
inherits from toPapyrusNode mapping that inherits from toPapyrusNodeView
mapping that set the  
element : PortNameLabel should not in any case set the element, the
element is set in the Port_Shape view. for the inherited ports this
creates a conflict and did not display the label -->  create an abstract
mapping just like PapyrusConnectorLabel and ensure that we did not set
the element in this mapping. toLabel() inherits now the new mapping  
* add junit test to be sure that for all PortNameLabel View no element
was set

This seem to be aimed for master, i.e. Oxygen. Keep in mind that we eventually need it for the Neon maintenance branch as well, to be able to use it in context of Papyrus-RT 0.9.

I tried a quick test of this in the context of Papyrus-RT, but I bump into compilation errors and unresolved dependencies. Which I guess is due to that this is based on master and not streams/2.0-maintenance. I'll have to wait with testing this until there is a Gerrit change streams/2.0-maintenance

I will wait until the gerrit trigger a build, there is no triggered build for this gerrit, usually when we push a gerrit, it trigger a build to ensure that the patch compiles and tests succeed. the cherry pisck to maintenance should be done after merging this gerrit to master (oxygen) I think
