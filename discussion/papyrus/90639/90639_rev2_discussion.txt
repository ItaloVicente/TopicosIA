DESCRIPTION:

Bug 511917 - [Model import] update the model import tool to produce a
Port_NameLabel view without an explicit set of element

* the toLabel() mapping that creates the DecorationNode PortNameLabel
inherits from toPapyrusNode mapping that inherits from toPapyrusNodeView
mapping that set the  
element : PortNameLabel should not in any case set the element, the
element is set in the Port_Shape view. for the inherited ports this
creates a conflict and did not display the label -->  create an abstract
mapping just like PapyrusConnectorLabel and ensure that we did not set
the element in this mapping. toLabel() inherits now the new mapping  
* add junit test to be sure that for all PortNameLabel View no element
was set

Not sure if it matters, but isn't more effective to do in the opposite direction, i.e. do the patch on Neon maintenance, and cherry pick for Oxygen. Since the need is actually coming from Papyrus-RT which still uses Neon, I guess it makes more sense to first do the patch on Neon.

OK, to be able to quickly test the patch for Papyrus RT, I think that you are right, and that I can propose the same gerrit for Neon. I will do it.
