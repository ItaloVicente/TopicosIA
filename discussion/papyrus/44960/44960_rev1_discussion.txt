DESCRIPTION:

Bug 463564: [Performances] Opening a menu in the ModelExplorer takes several seconds (Mars M6)
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=463564

Add caching of read-only state for direct queries on resource URIs
(not just via EObjects).

Because many read-only queries are not done within read transactions,
discontinue the tie-in to transactions and, instead, always cache
read-only state and expire the cache (by default) in an async runnable
on the display.

Update the unit tests to inject a custom executor to control when the
cache is cleared.

Patch Set 1:

The reason why the read-only state of resources wasn't being cached at all in the scenario of showing the context menu in the Model Explorer is because the vast majority of accesses to the read-only manager were to query the read-only state of a resource directly, not indirectly via an EObject contained in the resource.  That was the only API that was cached before:  read-only state of a model element.

So, the first major change in this patch is to additionally cache the read-only state of resources in the FSReadOnlyHandler, itself.  This was easily and safely done by a minor refactoring of the AbstractReadOnlyHandler to make the cache available to subclasses.

However, this was not sufficient because the cache was actually always a no-op in the context-menu scenario.  The problem here is that caching was only active during the scope of a transaction in the read-only manager's editing domain.  However, the vast majority (if not all) of the read-only queries in the context-menu scenario are done without a transaction.  And even if they were done in a transaction, each and every one probably would have had its own transaction, nullifying any cache and probably making performance a bit worse by always setting up and tearing down the cache machinery.

So, the second major change in this patch is to eliminate the cache's tie to transactions.  Now, the cache is implicitly initialized when read-only state is queried and is purged in an async exec (abstracted through an injected Executor).  This fixes the read-only part of the performance problems in the context menu.

A bit of work was needed to fix the read-only JUnit tests, by injecting a custom executor that the tests can use to control when the cache is purged to force re-calculation of read-only state of resources as they change state.  Note that the read-only manager's makeWritable(...) API still *synchronously* purges the cache as before, so the make-writable use cases should still work (which is born out by the tests, actually).

Looks good; there are indeed lots of graphical stuff happening outside read-only transactions (GMF was the main user of read-only transactions I think; we barely ever used them in the Papyrus UI)
