DESCRIPTION:

Bug 436368: Add missing CDT dependency.

The CDT New project wizard is used to create an output project.  That
wizard is implemented in cdt.ui, but uses dependency injection to
execute code from managedbuilder.ui.  This change adds that bundle
dependency so that binary installations will work properly.

I'm not able to test the buckminster build and install, but I've
simulated this by running with and without the managedbuilder.ui plugin.

While the behavior is now better, it is still not sufficient: The CDT project creation wizard now opens, but the toolchain is "empty toolchain" instead of "Linux gcc". Since no tool-chain is available, an NPE is following.

It is probably difficult to trigger the installation of a suitable toolchain via dependencies, since the required toolchain is platform specific

I had hoped that adding the bundle dependency would cause the buckminster build to pick up the platform-specific fragment as well.

It there a way to express platform-specific dependencies in the buckminster files?  If so then we could make the various platforms pull in the appropriate fragments.

At this point it might not be worth risking further breakage though.  The work-around is fairly easy to understand (install CDT).  Also, people that care about this feature are likely to already have CDT installed; or would be planning to install it, anyhow.

The feature now contains a dependency to the CDT feature and it seems to work fine.
