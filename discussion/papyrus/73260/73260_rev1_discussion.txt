Line:35, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types/model/ElementTypesConfigurations.ecore -> Should we not also be able to reference non-modelled advices (declared on the GMF extension point) also?  That would need a string attribute to reference them by ID.  We have a precedent for this in the reference of an element-type configuration to its super-types, by ID.  (although the advice does already have an EReference for the target element-type)

If the configuration model has a proxy (place-holder) object to represent a non-modelled advice then that would work with this EReference, so in that case it would be okay.

Line:35, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types/model/ElementTypesConfigurations.ecore -> ExternallyRegisteredAdvice has been introduced for that purpose: it is a proxy for advices that have been registered with the extensionpoint mechanism.

The only hesitation I would have is whether it's too late now in Neon to merge this, that maybe it needs to wait until Oxygen, in which case it would actually be a breaking API change.  But probably any Papyrus users that already have type-configuration models using the before/after feature wouldn't want their models broken at this stage of the Neon release, either?  I don't know.
Line:35, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types/model/ElementTypesConfigurations.ecore -> Ah, okay.  Good!
