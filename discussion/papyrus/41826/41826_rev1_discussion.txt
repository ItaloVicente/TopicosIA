DESCRIPTION:

Bug 436998: [Control Mode] Exceptions when trying to control multiple elements in the same resource
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=436998

Implement updates to the CDOAwareModelSet and related tests that were missed when
the base ModelSet behaviour was refactored for control-mode changes.

Basically, override the initial removal of resources from the resource set that are
dirty, because CDO does not permit dirty their removal from the set.  Also, don't
attempt to process cross-unit references on CDOResources because it causes NPEs on
deleted resources later and they don't have cross-references of any kind anyways.

Update the CDO control-mode tests to use the extensible service registry because now
the control-mode framework requires some new services.

This commit fixes the test failure in the CDO integration layer tests that was caused by the resolution of bug 436998.  I have endeavoured to adapt the new behaviour of the ModelSet in processing deletion of obsolete resources, but I don't know why the ModelSet was changed in the way that it was, so I don't suppose that uncontrolling resources in CDO actually works.  At the very least, it isn't completely broken as it was before.  CDO doesn't permit a dirty resource to be removed from the resource set, so moving the removal of resources ahead of the save step was a breaking change.
