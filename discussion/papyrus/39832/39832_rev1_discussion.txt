Christian,Camille

so here I have just update the main mwe2 workflow.
then I have updated the pom to execute at biuld time the generation of the code.

I didn't commit the generated code, only the two files I have modificated.
This could the purpose of a second commit OR the time not to commit the src-gen and xtend-gen folders.

Thanks for the review.

Francois

Line:21, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> Can this all be simplified using the xtext-maven-plugin?  After all, our workflow is an Xtext generator workflow and that's the purpose of the xtext-maven-plugin.  It might also remove the need for some (many?) of the changes in the workflow model, itself.

See https://github.com/cdietrich/xtext-maven-example for an example.

Otherwise, there is also a Maven plug-in for MWE2 execution:

Is this using an MWE/Xtext-specific URI map that does support multiple-mappings?

Hello there,

so I am not a mwe2 workflow, but I am quite confident thaht mwe2 workflow do not overlay exactly with xtend.

in our case, mwe2 workflow generate ecore,genmodel files and also xtend.

a good link for mwe2 http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.xtext.doc%2Fcontents%2F118-mwe-in-depth.html

a good link to a little reimplementation of mwe2 workflow with xtend: 
http://20000frames.blogspot.fr/2013/01/mwe2-workflows-using-xtend.html

have a look to the conclusion of the author that compares the two technologies.

I am not sure we want to spent time to reimplement work done in mwe2 and switch to pure xtend as they are no gain functions.

Here my work was more focused on industrialization of code in the context of papyrus.
Line:21, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> Hello
1) initially the mwe2 workflow was buggy: i have used the 2012 version several times and not the latest one january 2015.
this implementation is working

2) here I do understand, there is not only the xtend element, the mwe2 workflow executes several steps independant from the xtend steps.
if you execute mvn install, you will see the multiple modifications ! It is quite important almost 200 files.

So to clarify,
about using the maven plugin mwe2 it is not necessary to my humble opinion.

no, we can not simplify by calling only the xtend plugin, we need both.

Francois

Knut's Xtend workflow DSL sure looks cool, but I wasn't in any way suggesting something like that.  Sorry if I gave that impression.  The MWE2 language is good enough for me.  My only real concern was using maven to launch the workflow as an external Java program instead of using a more abstract maven plug-in.
Line:21, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> OK, understood that we need to run the MWE2 workflow and the Xtend compilation separately.  That's fine.

But what about the workflow execution?  Here we are invoking it as a Java program, but there is a maven plug-in available that runs a workflow in a more abstract way.  Would that not be preferred?  Why is it "not necessary"?

This is not in the works as of now. This can be unearthed if we need it again.
