DESCRIPTION:

431618: [Model Validation View] Problems on deleted elements become zombies
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=431618

Add a destroy-elements advice that deletes markers attached to the object being deleted and recreates them on undo.  Each marker provider implementation provides an undoable marker-deletion command optimized for its storage domain.

The new marker deletion advice exposed, in testing, bugs in the edit infrastructure (the interaction between GMF Tooling's generated code, Papyrus's base edit-helper framework, and the core edit-helper framework from GMF run-time).

1. ChangeDescriptions do not record sufficient information to correctly redo deletion of elements from subset lists that have changeable supersets (not derived unions).  Papyrus provides custom commands (such as ActivityNodeHelper::DestroyActivityNode) that work around this by wrapping the UML edit providers' destroy commands and delegating undo and redo to them.  However, when edit advice introduces non-EMF commands (such as for marker deletion), then the undo/redo of the composite ends up relying on the recorded change-description anyways to undo/redo the EMF changes.  This is worked around by a new advice that fixes up the redo of element deletion to ensure that supersets are properly updated.

2. Visual element types specializing the GMF null element type discard the core editing command.  For example, the org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.Package_2009 element type in the deployment diagram is a specialization of the null element type.  This element type only gathers commands from advice and does not look for the "semantic command" recorded by the generated semantic edit policy in a request parameter, so if any advice actually provides a command, then the original semantic edit command is discarded.  The work-around is to ensure that advice contributions do not provide commands when they are invoked by delegation from the semantic edit policy, but only when invoked by the actual semantic edit helper.

The core of the fix is addition of a destroy-elements advice that deletes markers attached to the object being deleted and recreates them on undo. Each marker provider implementation (for Eclipse workspace and for CDO) provides an undoable marker-deletion command optimized for its storage domain.

The bugs mentioned in the review description were evident in regression test failures in the JUnit test suite (hurray for tests!) during a phase in development in which the MarkerDeletionAdvice always contributed a marker deletion command, even if it turned out that there were actually no markers to delete (actually looking for markers being a potentially expensive operation in the Eclipse Workspace domain). The problem boiled down to various components not being prepared for what happens in the GMF Run-time when non-EMF operations (such as manipulation of Eclipse Workspace markers) are interleaved with EMF-based model operations, which ends up significantly changing how the composite edit command manages transactions and implements undo/redo.
