@Camille: The whole point of this provider is to redirect support for some view types to standard activity view provider (the 'super'). Since the 'delegate' does not support the dynamic view types (at least this specific type), we have to explicitly decline it independently on any semantic checks. Otherwise we claiming true in provides() without actually providing something. 

I suggested rewording for comment, may be it will make intent more clear. 
I am not aware about other dynamic view types, but if there are others, we probably should add them into the checks here.
Line:26, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.interactionoverview/src-gen/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/interactionoverview/provider/InheritedActivityDiagramEditPartProvider.java -> Please reword as: 

        /**
	 * This is workaround for bug #464093. 
         * The view type 'compartment_shape_display' is auxiliary and is provided externally 
         * (from the org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.symbols plugin) for all diagrams. 
         * 
         * Views of this kind shares semantic element with the main node so we can't distinguish them by semantic checks 
         * and have to explicitly rule them out to avoid interferention

The problem is that it can be very difficult to identify all dynamic views, because they are dynamic. I can think of:

- Symbols Compartment
- Stereotype Compartments (1/applied stereotype)
- Viewpoint Compartments (Work-in-progress to add custom edit parts via a Viewpoint-like Extension): potentially an infinite and unpredictable number of new elements (Although they should all have the same View::type, I think)

There are also several examples of plug-ins which extend Papyrus to add new dynamic elements, but are not included into the Papyrus project, so we have no control over them, and no way to do an exhaustive list of types (Not so many of them yet, but that's something we're experimenting and we'd like to promote when we're satisfied with the feasibility)

So I see several options:

- Use a pattern to identify such custom elements (type = custom_*, e.g. type = "custom_myExtension")
- Use EditPartProviders priorities?
- Don't rely only on semantic element, but also take View::type into account (Explicitly list what is supported)

Since I'm not too familiar with the GMF Framework, I can't tell which is the best solution (And maybe some of them are not possible also). I add Patrick and Rémi as reviewers, they may have additional comments/ideas
