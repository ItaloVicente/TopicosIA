DESCRIPTION:

Bug 464647: [Synchronization] Generate JUnit tests for diagram view synchronization
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=464647

Adaptation of initial prototype of a Papyrus Tests Generation framework to add
diagram synchronization tests.

Changes by Christian W. Damus <give.a.damus@gmail.com>:

Rebase onto latest Mars maintenance branch.

Fix .ignores: ensure that only contents of xtend-gen/ folders are ignored,
not the folders themselves

Convert Xtend codegen templates to UTF-8 encoding

Update the QVTo transformation to support the statically generated
UTP profile.  This requires:

- invoking the UMLResourcesUtil API for stand-alone set-up
- updating the profile-registration workflow component to support
   the registration of a statically generated profile
- updating the QVTo transformation to ensure that applicable
   stereotypes are resolved in the proper ResourceSet context to
   avoid losing all applied stereotypes in the generated test model.
   This, in turn, requires a Java black box to handle the EMF-specific
   concerns of resource-set context that QVTo is not aware of

Fix build.properties files to include all sources and POMs to generate
sources in xtend-gen/ folder.

Fix compilation problems in the integration of the generated tests into
the master suite bundle.  Update the Tycho build to include the test generation
framework bundle.  Update the build and Oomph setup to include the UPR profile
bundle dependency and the Papyrus Developer tools dependency.

Fix numerous codegen problems:

- base model does not reflect correct package name for palette tests
- inject replaceable templates instead of making them all static
- add generation of import statements in suites
- fix references to test constants interface
- fix references to diagram creation command

Fix remaining compilation errors in Use Case tests:

- look up the DiagramUpdater class to compute correct import
- factor out creation of generated files into an utility extension
- factor out generation of the copyright header comment
- add some imports to templates that were missing them

Refactor Xtend codegen templates to:

- improve management of imports
- improve names of AllXyzTestsGen suite classes
- don't generate test classes that have no test cases
- share common code to simplify the specific test case templates

Fix more code generation problems:

* missing package imports for required edit-part classes
* invalid package imports (non-existent edit-part classes)
* non-conformant names of diagram creation command and test constants interface.
  This introduces new attributes to test classes in the model, of String type,
  specifying the relevant type names.  The defaults are computed by the QVTo
  transformation but may be overridden (hard-coded) by a diagram test's bundle's
  specific QVTo to provide custom names

Add generated tests for Communication Diagram.

Fixed workflow infrastructure to support all-tests generation.

Use URI mappings to eliminate the need to copy and delete the
framework's QVTo files.

Add an infrastructure for generation of diagram synchronization tests.
This includes

* new abstract test classes in the oep.uml.diagram.tests bundle
* updates to the framework UML model to capture the new base test classes
* new QVTo transformation to generate synchronization tests in the UTP model
* new Xtend template to generate synchronization tests from the UTP

Fixed various small problems:

* unwanted newlines in some test method bodies
* fully-qualified references to UMLTypes class in synchronization tests
* missing commas in QVTo scripts that cause edit-part names to be concatenated
* (a biggie, actually) fix the all-tests generation to avoid repeating all
  previous transformations at each step

Translate QVTo transformation steps to Xtend:

Xtend exposes list values in UML models in their native EList terms, which affords stable and predictable ordering of transformation operations and, hence, test model structure and generated code.  It also provides for more concise, debuggable, searchable, and performant transformations with better Java integration.

Assign predictable, stable XMI identifiers to elements of generated UML models to avoid
unnecessary diffs in source control when re-generating.

Regenerate code from the Xtend version of the framework. Git-ignore the generated UTP
source models because they reference and depend on UML instance models of the GMFGens
that are already git-ignored, so there's no point in having these in git.  Besides that
they are now much larger because of the generated unique XMI IDs.

Develop a DSL for compact and readable declarations of transformation rules for test
contexts and assembly into packages.  This uses new active annotations which, owing to
a logistical limitation of Xtend, must be defined in a new separate plug-in project.

Finally! Fixed the generation of the wrong diagram-updater instance field reference
for Sequence Diagram, which as a legacy diagram still uses TYPED_INSTANCE.  This
employs a class-file scanning hack that is potentially expensive in I/O, so it
uses a new @Cached active annotation that caches method computation results.

Complete the specification of generation of view synchronization tests, adding the
following scenarios:

* synchronize child label nodes in label compartments of top shapes
* synchronize child shape nodes in shape compartments of top shapes
* synchronize connections between shapes
* synchronize connections between shapes where the source owns the semantic link

Define a new ClassificationSuite JUnit test runner that supports filtering entire
suites by classification annotations.  Apply this runner with the @GeneratedTest
annotation to all generated test-suite classes.

Refine the generation of link creation and synchronization tests to test links only
between edit-parts that the GMFGen model reports as valid sources and targets for
the links.  This vastly reduces the number of invalid test cases generated for
elements that cannot be linked (such as Include between an Actor and a Package).

Integrate code generation into the build (both maven build and Eclipse workspace)
and suppress generated sources from source control.  This is implemented as a build
profile in a new parent POM for the UML Diagram Tests bundles.

Further elaboration and fixes:

* rename 'edition' tests as DirectEdit in generated tests (not yet in the framework)
* use a generic name for the test class for top node creation from palette
* fix test cases for creation of links in containers to actually create the source and target elements in such container
* fix the ClassificationConfig to drill into test suites to look for further filtering annotations instead of assuming that the entire suite is a 'standard' test when the 'standard' tests are excluded by the requested configuration
* split test cases that execute multiple test scenarios into separate test case methods per test scenario.  This ensures that a single test failure doesn't hide several other test results
* move @GeneratedTest annotation from test case method to the test context class to reduce overhead of annotations in the VM
* use the GMFGen model's information about child node containment to avoid generating all permutations of top-node/child-node, eliminating most of the the invalid child-node creation tests
* fix broken references to the UML model for the Ecore metamodel in UML models for the gmfgen and genmodel metamodels by redirecting them to the UML2-provided Ecore metamodel. Delete the obsolete local ecore.uml
* define a model of test exceptions for the purpose of constraining the generation of the UML-UTP model to exclude unwanted permutations of edit parts, optionally for specific kinds of tests
* enhance the UML-UTP test model generation to filter the tests that it would generate through the optionally provided test exceptions models
* add a test exclusions model to the Use Case test bundle to exclude tests for package-import relationships on classifiers (which UML supports but the diagram does not)
* generate a CSS stylesheet (attached via an annotation on the test context class) to enable synchronization of the diagrams for tests
* fix generation of invalid child-node permutations in the synchronization tests by using the compartment container information in the GMFGen model
* fix various bugs in the abstract test framework operations found by running the generated tests

Christian,
I would like to know if it could be possible to add some specific documentation to introduce the general test generation process to be sure we not lose the intelligency you and Juan put inside this set of plugins?
If it could be in a folder named site/resource site/xdoc, it will be great to keep the format to generate the maven web site.
This idea is to have a general overview of the princips you put in this framework.

I could help you for the syntax/infra or here the https://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/xdoc-format.html

Just a few paragraphes with a general images to display the main concepts?

Francois
