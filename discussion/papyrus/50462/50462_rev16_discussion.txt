DESCRIPTION:

Bug 464647: [Tests] Generate JUnit tests for diagram view synch
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=464647

Adaptation of initial prototype of a Papyrus Tests Generation framework
to add diagram synchronization tests.

Changes by Christian W. Damus <give.a.damus@gmail.com>:

Rebase onto latest Mars maintenance branch.

Fix .ignores: ensure that only contents of xtend-gen/ folders are
ignored, not the folders themselves

Convert Xtend codegen templates to UTF-8 encoding

Update the QVTo transformation to support the statically generated UTP
profile.  This requires:

- invoking the UMLResourcesUtil API for stand-alone set-up
- updating the profile-registration workflow component to support
   the registration of a statically generated profile
- updating the QVTo transformation to ensure that applicable
   stereotypes are resolved in the proper ResourceSet context to
   avoid losing all applied stereotypes in the generated test model.
   This, in turn, requires a Java black box to handle the EMF-specific
   concerns of resource-set context that QVTo is not aware of

Fix build.properties files to include all sources and POMs to generate
sources in xtend-gen/ folder.

Fix compilation problems in the integration of the generated tests into
the master suite bundle.  Update the Tycho build to include the test
generation framework bundle.  Update the build and Oomph setup to
include the UPR profile bundle dependency and the Papyrus Developer
tools dependency.

Fix numerous codegen problems:

- base model does not reflect correct package name for palette tests
- inject replaceable templates instead of making them all static
- add generation of import statements in suites
- fix references to test constants interface
- fix references to diagram creation command

Fix remaining compilation errors in Use Case tests:

- look up the DiagramUpdater class to compute correct import
- factor out creation of generated files into an utility extension
- factor out generation of the copyright header comment
- add some imports to templates that were missing them

Refactor Xtend codegen templates to:

- improve management of imports
- improve names of AllXyzTestsGen suite classes
- don't generate test classes that have no test cases
- share common code to simplify the specific test case templates

Fix more code generation problems:

* missing package imports for required edit-part classes
* invalid package imports (non-existent edit-part classes)
* non-conformant names of diagram creation command and test constants
interface.
  This introduces new attributes to test classes in the model, of String
type,
  specifying the relevant type names.  The defaults are computed by the
QVTo
  transformation but may be overridden (hard-coded) by a diagram test's
bundle's
  specific QVTo to provide custom names

Add generated tests for Communication Diagram.

Fixed workflow infrastructure to support all-tests generation.

Use URI mappings to eliminate the need to copy and delete the
framework's QVTo files.

Add an infrastructure for generation of diagram synchronization tests.
This includes

* new abstract test classes in the oep.uml.diagram.tests bundle
* updates to the framework UML model to capture the new base test
classes
* new QVTo transformation to generate synchronization tests in the UTP
model
* new Xtend template to generate synchronization tests from the UTP

Fixed various small problems:

* unwanted newlines in some test method bodies
* fully-qualified references to UMLTypes class in synchronization tests
* missing commas in QVTo scripts that cause edit-part names to be
concatenated
* (a biggie, actually) fix the all-tests generation to avoid repeating
all
  previous transformations at each step

Translate QVTo transformation steps to Xtend:

Xtend exposes list values in UML models in their native EList terms,
which affords stable and predictable ordering of transformation
operations and, hence, test model structure and generated code.  It also
provides for more concise, debuggable, searchable, and performant
transformations with better Java integration.

Assign predictable, stable XMI identifiers to elements of generated UML
models to avoid unnecessary diffs in source control when re-generating.

Regenerate code from the Xtend version of the framework. Git-ignore the
generated UTP source models because they reference and depend on UML
instance models of the GMFGens that are already git-ignored, so there's
no point in having these in git.  Besides that they are now much larger
because of the generated unique XMI IDs.

Develop a DSL for compact and readable declarations of transformation
rules for test contexts and assembly into packages.  This uses new
active annotations which, owing to a logistical limitation of Xtend,
must be defined in a new separate plug-in project.

Finally! Fixed the generation of the wrong diagram-updater instance
field reference for Sequence Diagram, which as a legacy diagram still
uses TYPED_INSTANCE.  This employs a class-file scanning hack that is
potentially expensive in I/O, so it uses a new @Cached active annotation
that caches method computation results.

Complete the specification of generation of view synchronization tests,
adding the following scenarios:

* synchronize child label nodes in label compartments of top shapes
* synchronize child shape nodes in shape compartments of top shapes
* synchronize connections between shapes
* synchronize connections between shapes where the source owns the
semantic link

Define a new ClassificationSuite JUnit test runner that supports
filtering entire suites by classification annotations.  Apply this
runner with the @GeneratedTest annotation to all generated test-suite
classes.

Refine the generation of link creation and synchronization tests to test
links only between edit-parts that the GMFGen model reports as valid
sources and targets for the links.  This vastly reduces the number of
invalid test cases generated for elements that cannot be linked (such as
Include between an Actor and a Package).

Integrate code generation into the build (both maven build and Eclipse
workspace) and suppress generated sources from source control.  This is
implemented as a build profile in a new parent POM for the UML Diagram
Tests bundles.

Further elaboration and fixes:

* rename 'edition' tests as DirectEdit in generated tests (not yet in
the framework)
* use a generic name for the test class for top node creation from
palette
* fix test cases for creation of links in containers to actually create
the source and target elements in such container
* fix the ClassificationConfig to drill into test suites to look for
further filtering annotations instead of assuming that the entire suite
is a 'standard' test when the 'standard' tests are excluded by the
requested configuration
* split test cases that execute multiple test scenarios into separate
test case methods per test scenario.  This ensures that a single test
failure doesn't hide several other test results
* move @GeneratedTest annotation from test case method to the test
context class to reduce overhead of annotations in the VM
* use the GMFGen model's information about child node containment to
avoid generating all permutations of top-node/child-node, eliminating
most of the the invalid child-node creation tests
* fix broken references to the UML model for the Ecore metamodel in UML
models for the gmfgen and genmodel metamodels by redirecting them to the
UML2-provided Ecore metamodel. Delete the obsolete local ecore.uml
* define a model of test exceptions for the purpose of constraining the
generation of the UML-UTP model to exclude unwanted permutations of edit
parts, optionally for specific kinds of tests
* enhance the UML-UTP test model generation to filter the tests that it
would generate through the optionally provided test exceptions models
* add a test exclusions model to the Use Case test bundle to exclude
tests for package-import relationships on classifiers (which UML
supports but the diagram does not)
* generate a CSS stylesheet (attached via an annotation on the test
context class) to enable synchronization of the diagrams for tests
* fix generation of invalid child-node permutations in the
synchronization tests by using the compartment container information in
the GMFGen model
* fix various bugs in the abstract test framework operations found by
running the generated tests

Further refinement and fixes:

* add some more flexibility to test exceptions model and utilize it for
exclusion of some more Class Diagram tests that don't make sense or
cannot be generated like the rest
* simplify the generation of synchronization tests, removing the
specialized M2T templates
* fix the deletion tests that failed because the edit-part to be deleted
was not selected
* fix the tests dealing with child label nodes in nodes that are
themselves child nodes by ensuring proper creation of a top-level node
to contain the nested node that has the label children
* fix abstract appearance test cases, resolving a large proportion of
test failures
* further simplification of the M2T templates based on structure of the
UTP model
* don't just not generate excluded tests, but apply the @FailingTest,
@NotImplemented, and @Ignore annotations as appropriate to the reason
for the test exclusion
* now that the UTP model is not managed in source control, it can use
generated XMI IDs to save some space (the computed unique IDs were long,
based on qualified names)
* add another kind of test exception that blanket excludes an edit-part
from all tests
* add support for completely omitting test cases from the generated code
(instead of just annotating them), e.g. for cases where the generated
code would not even compile
* create a DSL embedded in the transformation workflow for definition of
test exceptions, as a convenient and integrated alternative to the
test-exceptions model
* add default calculation of edit-parts-to-test lists for all kinds of
tests, to stream-line the workflow model.  Employ this with the new
test-exceptions DSL in the Use Case Diagram tests generation workflow as
an example of how it all works

* further streamlining of the test exceptions DSL with an active
annotation generating constants for the reason kinds and multiplicative
nesting of edit-part blocks in forbidden permutation rules
* adopt the test exceptions DSL in the Class Diagram tests
* support injection of custom GMFGen-to-UTP transformation rules
* customize the link creation tests in the Class Diagram to fix
association link failures caused by odd default name that associations
get in the test environment
* automatically compute imports for all edit-part classes actually
required by the tests, based on the references to edit-parts in the
generated activities, to avoid unused import warnings for edit-part
classes that would only have been used by tests that were excluded
* fix some problems in behavior diagram tests that failed on attempting
to create the top container frame (behavior) that was already implicitly
created by creation of the diagram
