DESCRIPTION:

Add support for "unsettable" features in EMF models.  As the IOne API
already provides for the concept of a "default" value, it makes sense
to add API that lets clients query whether the one's value is what it
is because it's defaulted or whether the value was explicitly set but
happens to be the same as the default.

Patch Set 1:

This change follows up (and depends on) review 54318.

The GMF Notation model has a peculiar structure in the View::element reference, which is "unsettable" in the EMF feature sense of supporting a separate "unset" state and which has a default value that is derived from the element references of the parent view chain.

To support AOF bindings and other operations on such references, the AOF needs to support this "unset" state explicitly.  As the EMF implementation of the AOF represents all scalar features as IOnes, and as the IOne interface already provides a default value, it seemed useful to add an "isDefault" API to IOne in order to let clients know when the box's value is defaulted.  The EMF implementation of the IOne for scalar features takes account of the unset state and exposes it in this new API.  The One class and its delegate likewise provide the default state for other domains.

New JUnit tests are included for simple scenarios in the EMF domain and the core AOF.
