- Add CollectNextPageVisitor in SashWindowsContainer to collect the
next/previous page
- Extend org.eclipse.ui.bindings with 2 key sequences: CTRL+TAB and
CTRL+M2+TAB triggering commands below

I tested the patch on my Mac, and it works as expected.  That is, if what is expected is that navigation cycles only between the the tabs in the particular sash-panel that is currently active (which I think is the intention).  So, that's fine.

I have only a couple of further comments, of which the only one that I think needs attention is the stderr exception printing.
Line:59, plugins/editor/org.eclipse.papyrus.editor/plugin.xml -> Nice.

Line:33, plugins/editor/org.eclipse.papyrus.editor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/editor/handlers/NextTabHandler.java -> Don't strictly need this if it only calls super.  :-)

Line:33, plugins/editor/org.eclipse.papyrus.editor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/editor/handlers/PreviousTabHandler.java -> Ditto.

Line:61, plugins/editor/org.eclipse.papyrus.editor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/editor/handlers/TraverseTabHandler.java -> This shouldn't go to stderr.  It should be logged or, if appropriate, presented to the user (via the StatusManager).

The keybinding mapping is not cross platform (replace CTRL by M1)
see http://help.eclipse.org/luna/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fextension-points%2Forg_eclipse_ui_bindings.html

The recognized modifiers keys are M1, M2, M3, M4, ALT, COMMAND, CTRL, and SHIFT. The "M" modifier keys are a platform-independent way of representing keys, and these are generally preferred. M1 is the COMMAND key on MacOS X, and the CTRL key on most other platforms. M2 is the SHIFT key. M3 is the Option key on MacOS X, and the ALT key on most other platforms. M4 is the CTRL key on MacOS X, and is undefined on other platforms. Since M2+M3+<Letter> (Alt+Shift+<Letter>) is reserved on MacOS X for writing special characters, such bindings are commonly undefined for platform="carbon" and redefined as M1+M3+<Letter>.

Ordinarily, yes, but not in this case because we mustn't clash with the system shortcut.
Line:41, plugins/editor/org.eclipse.papyrus.editor/plugin.xml -> But it does work.  I tested this commit on my Mac.

Ctrl modifier may be used here explicitly because, as I commented initially, on Mac the Cmd+Tab shortcut is a system-level invocation of the application switcher and therefore cannot be used in this application specific (Eclipse) context.

Line:47, plugins/editor/org.eclipse.papyrus.editor/plugin.xml -> As above, it works fine and doesn't clash with the system-level Cmd+Shift+Tab of the application switcher.
