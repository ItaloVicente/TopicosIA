Sorry, I guess I should have looked at the rest of the review the first time.

I don't think solution is complete.  It doesn't appear to handle editors that are divided by sash-panes into multiple tab folders.
Line:32, plugins/editor/org.eclipse.papyrus.editor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/editor/handlers/TraverseTabHandler.java -> This should be set by the constructor.  Then it can be private and also final.

Line:62, plugins/editor/org.eclipse.papyrus.editor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/editor/handlers/TraverseTabHandler.java -> Should we prefer an XML enablement expression in the plugin.xml to avoid loading this class (and, probably, most of Papyrus) when the user hits Ctrl+Tab in a workbench that is not working with Papyrus models (maybe it's only editing Java code)?

Line:1334, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/internal/SashWindowsContainer.java -> This isn't used.

Line:1343, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/internal/SashWindowsContainer.java -> Shouldn't this be correlated to 'expectedClass'?  Then an unchecked conversion wouldn't be needed.

Line:1348, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/internal/SashWindowsContainer.java -> What menu?

Line:1356, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/internal/SashWindowsContainer.java -> Each tab folder has a selected index.  Nothing here is checking which tab folder is the active folder.

And what is the behaviour of 'next' and 'previous' across tab-folders?  What is the order in which the navigation should cycle through the sash panes containing tab-folders?

Line:1370, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/internal/SashWindowsContainer.java -> How about 'if (expected Class == null || expectedClass.isInstance(...' ?  Then we don't need to repeat ourselves in an else-if clause.
