DESCRIPTION:

Bug 489116 - Unify diagram visualID of all diagrams in Papyrus

1. Changed the visual ids of the UML2 diagrams from numbers to
meaningful names corresponding to notational cases. This was applied
consistely across diagram such that similar cases get similar visual
ids. Added diagram reconcilers for v1.2 to migrate older diagrams.

2. Amalgamated the UML2 diagram element types into a single model
(umldi.elementtypesconfigurations). Some diagrams, like Sequence,
Communication and Timing, still use extension-based configurations and
will need to be migrated later.
