There are already so many façade APIs for working with files (Guava, Apache Commons IO, Java7) that it doesn't seem to me generally useful to add another one in the infra-tools bundle.

These APIs are only used by the DSML Validation Generator.  Can they not just be included in that plug-in, instead of infra-tools?
Line:5, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> That's a weird package name.  Maybe just "file"?  We may eventually want to add file reading utilities.

Line:84, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/tools/filewriter/JavaIoFileSystemAccess.java -> I think the Java7 Path and Paths APIs might have more convenient/reliable facilities for parsing paths and making directories.

Line:55, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/tools/filewriter/ProjectBasedFileAccess.java -> What is this for?

Line:72, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/tools/filewriter/ProjectBasedFileAccess.java -> Shouldn't we maintain local version history?

Line:84, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/tools/filewriter/ProjectBasedFileAccess.java -> This is not a code-generation plug-in.

Line:96, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/tools/filewriter/ProjectBasedFileAccess.java -> This should be implemented.

Line:118, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/tools/filewriter/ProjectBasedFileAccess.java -> Java7 Paths?

The API is also used by the code generation plugins in the new designer repository.
Do you have a suggestion which facade API you mention is close to the interface that these functions provide? (I know it's bad to replicate functionality, but it's sometimes easier ...)
Line:55, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/tools/filewriter/ProjectBasedFileAccess.java -> You're right, the javadoc is missing

Line:72, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/tools/filewriter/ProjectBasedFileAccess.java -> Probably yes, thanks

Line:84, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/tools/filewriter/ProjectBasedFileAccess.java -> Originally, it was. I'll correct the message

Line:118, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/tools/filewriter/ProjectBasedFileAccess.java -> I'll have a look whether this simplifies the operation

Guava, Apache Commons, and Java7 that I mentioned all have convenient APIs for creating files from text.  But, of course, they don't provide a common interface for filesystem and Eclipse-workspace files, because of course they have no Eclipse concepts.  So, I suppose they only help with the filesystem-access implementation.
