Looks good to me.  A straight-forward refactoring.  I should leave it to Camille, as prime for releng, or Vincent as prime for tables, to approve and merge.

Have we yet resolved the question of how best to access/manage these intermediate POMs that aren't in Eclipse project folders?  Or is that just no longer a concern (it doesn't bother me, but I recall that there were questions about it).

For this initial modification, there is no need to manage these pom that are not in a folder with an eclipse project.
Then I will add the maven nature to the projects.
