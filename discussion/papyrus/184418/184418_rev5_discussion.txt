DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573986: [Toolsmiths] Properties view editor validation & incremental updates

Common fixes
- fix encoding and decoding of related object URIs in the problem markers
- handle stereotypes in nested packages (not profiles)
- fix NPE in architecture builder
- prompt to save editor before running quick fix if it's dirty
- save editor after running quick fix
- save and clean up resources loaded by the quick fix that the editor doesn't
  need to know about
- delete cross-references within the scope of context models
  when deleting a data-context element, to account for supertype
  references, both in the editor and the quick fix

Properties validation builder
- add new validation builder plug-in for Properties models
- check plugin.xml extensions for context and environment models
- check existence of referenced Java classes and implied bundle
  dependencies
- handle 'ppe' URI scheme in ModelDependenciesChecker via new generic
  service
- ensure that HREFs to environment models that do not use XMI IDs
  are not broken by automatic assignment of IDs on resource load
- ensure that XMI IDs are generated in context resources
- add annotations to the generated Properties Context model to trace
  to the original source model (UML Profile or Ecore model)
- add annotations to data context roots to record which layout generator
  was used to generate sections (used for quick fixes)
- hide annotations from the editor by default because they need not (and
  probably should not) be edited by the user
- infer traceability to source models from known constraints and
  internal relationships in the context model
- add derived reference to views that use a section, supported by
  generated CacheAdapter implementation
- add model validation rules for missing and obsolete data context
  elements and properties in the context model
- add custom validation rules for EMFInstanceOf, UMLInstanceOf, and
  HasStereotype constraints, that their referenced classes can be
  resolved
- validate that data-context properties, elements, and packages match
  their corresponding source model elements by name
- quick fixes to rename data-context properties, elements, and packages
  to match their source model elements
- includes 'touching' affected XWT resources to ensure that their
  qualified name references are updated
- add check for missing data-context package for nested package/profile
- check for entire source package/profile moved

Add marker resolutions for
- simple property-type inconsistency problems
- delete obsolete data-context properties
- add missing data-context properties
- add missing data-context properties with property editors in sections
- delete obsolete data-context elements
- add missing data-context elements
- add missing data-context elements with generated views
- quick fixes to generate data-context package with or without views
- add quick fix to find new package/profile location
  and update all source link URIs
- add a quick fix for unresolved class problems in constraints
- get appropriately qualified "expected name" of the class referenced by
  a constraint for population of marker data for the quick fix
- generate a fix for each valid name that the constraint can reference

Patch set 5 fixes the problem of dangling references being left behind when deleting a data-context element that is the supertype of some other data-context element, both in the quick fix and in the editor. This uses a custom variant of the EMF DeleteCommand that uses a custom UsageCrossReferencer that ignores the Section::widget reference, which avoids loading the XWT resources.

Thanks, Christian!

We found one more bug while testing this branch:

- The multiplicity of DataContext properties is not validated. If you change the multiplicity of a Profile property (From 1 or 0..1 to e.g. *), the properties model becomes inconsistent, but the validation doesn't detect the issue. However, multiplicity is properly checked for DataContext <-> PropertyEditor consistency (So if you manually fix the multiplicity in the DataContext property, the validation will then notice that existing Property Editors are incorrect, as expected)

And a missing feature:

- Generalizations/Extensions are not taken into account. DataContextElements can extend each other (following the Profile/Model structure), but there is no validation about it. Moreover, when adding a Property Editor to a View, there is no consistency check between the View's constraint and the edited property (So you could add a Property Editor a property of Stereotype A, in the View of Stereotype B, and the validation will not complain).

There are also some issues regarding DataTypes, but they have never been properly supported by the Properties Framework to begin with. So we should probably create a follow-up issue for that, but it's not specific to the Model Validation. The properties wizard is incorrect as well.

Ah, right. That should not be difficult to cover.

This is a check that should be implemented in the Properties Context model. I'm not sure that it belongs in the builder. The Data Context properties and Widget model provide all the information required for this rule; the trace to the source model (which would be a builder concern) is not needed. I think.

Yeah. I had briefly looked at including data types in the builder validation but quickly discovered that they don't work anyways, so it didn't make sense to continue down that road. :-)

I'm not sure where this should be added; but I think we need both:

- Consistency of the DataContext and UML Profile (Generalizations, and maybe Extensions, should be consistent with DataContextElement inheritance)
- Consistency of the Properties and DataContext (Referenced Properties should be consistent with DataContext hierarchy, i.e. we should only reference properties that are owned or inherited by the View's DataContextElement)

The second should be a warning (Because there is no strict relationship between a View and a DataContextElement; it all depends on the Constraint), but I think the first one should be an error
