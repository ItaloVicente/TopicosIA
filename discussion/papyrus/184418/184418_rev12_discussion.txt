DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573986: [Toolsmiths] Properties view editor validation & incremental updates

Common fixes
- fix encoding and decoding of related object URIs in the problem markers
- handle stereotypes in nested packages (not profiles)
- fix NPE in architecture builder
- prompt to save editor before running quick fix if it's dirty
- save editor after running quick fix
- save and clean up resources loaded by the quick fix that the editor doesn't
  need to know about
- delete cross-references within the scope of context models
  when deleting a data-context element, to account for supertype
  references, both in the editor and the quick fix

Properties validation builder
- add new validation builder plug-in for Properties models
- check plugin.xml extensions for context and environment models
- check existence of referenced Java classes and implied bundle
  dependencies
- handle 'ppe' URI scheme in ModelDependenciesChecker via new generic
  service
- ensure that HREFs to environment models that do not use XMI IDs
  are not broken by automatic assignment of IDs on resource load
- ensure that XMI IDs are generated in context resources
- add annotations to the generated Properties Context model to trace
  to the original source model (UML Profile or Ecore model)
- add annotations to data context roots to record which layout generator
  was used to generate sections (used for quick fixes)
- hide annotations from the editor by default because they need not (and
  probably should not) be edited by the user
- infer traceability to source models from known constraints and
  internal relationships in the context model
- add derived reference to views that use a section, supported by
  generated CacheAdapter implementation
- add model validation rules for missing and obsolete data context
  elements and properties in the context model
- add custom validation rules for EMFInstanceOf, UMLInstanceOf, and
  HasStereotype constraints, that their referenced classes can be
  resolved
- validate that data-context properties, elements, and packages match
  their corresponding source model elements by name
- quick fixes to rename data-context properties, elements, and packages
  to match their source model elements
- includes 'touching' affected XWT resources to ensure that their
  qualified name references are updated
- add check for missing data-context package for nested package/profile
- check for entire source package/profile moved

Add marker resolutions for
- simple property-type inconsistency problems
- delete obsolete data-context properties
- add missing data-context properties
- add missing data-context properties with property editors in sections
- delete obsolete data-context elements
- add missing data-context elements
- add missing data-context elements with generated views
- quick fixes to generate data-context package with or without views
- add quick fix to find new package/profile location
  and update all source link URIs
- add a quick fix for unresolved class problems in constraints
- get appropriately qualified "expected name" of the class referenced by
  a constraint for population of marker data for the quick fix
- generate a fix for each valid name that the constraint can reference
