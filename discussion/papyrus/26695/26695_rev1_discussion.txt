DESCRIPTION:

434993: [Tests] Fix memory leaks in tests so they may run in one combined suite
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=434993

Integrate the SysML tests into the main test suite.  Includes:

- a new "Papyrus Core Tests (no SysML)" launcher that excludes
   the SysML tests
- the "Papyrus ALL Tests", "Papyrus Core Tests (no SysML)", and
   "Papyrus SysML Tests" launchers all cap the object heap at
   768 MB to run comfortably but still alert us if memory
   management regresses
- updates the Any script executed by the build to remove the
   second step of launching the SysML tests, because they are
   now integrated into the one step

I have pushed a Gerrit review with further changes:

https://git.eclipse.org/r/26695

This integrates the SysML tests into the main "Papyrus ALL Tests" suite in the place in the sequence where they were formerly, before they were split off into a separate execution.  A system property supports excluding these tests.

A new "Papyrus Core Tests (no SysML)" launch configuration runs this test suite as it was before, excluding the SysML tests, using that new system property.

The "Papyrus SysML Tests" launch configuration still launches the SysML tests only.

All three of the launch configurations now configure the HotSpot JVM thus:

  - max 768 MB of object heap.  This lets the tests run comfortably but
    still ensures that if memory leaking regresses dramatically, we may
    find out via OutOfMemoryError in test execution

  - tune the garbage collector to more aggressively evict soft reference
    caches than it would by default.  The Common Navigator Framework
    retains everything ever shown in a tree via soft references, which
    makes it difficult to see whether memory is leaking when observing
    the tests under a profiler.  This also, hopefully, makes the GC
    overhead a bit smoother when executing the tests with a constrained
    heap limit

Finally, the Ant script that runs the tests in the build is updated to remove the separate execution of the SysML tests, because these are now integrated.

Great!

Does this commit depend on any patch from another project? (I think there is still a patch in OCL which is not available to Hudson yet?)

Nope, no dependencies. Although an OCL build is now available to unblock a test that is currently disabled, which is specifically a memory-leak test (with reference assertions).
