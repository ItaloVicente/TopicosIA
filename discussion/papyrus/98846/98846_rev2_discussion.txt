DESCRIPTION:

Bug 512554: [Architecture-General] No Disable Workspace Model Indexer facility

Improve performance of the workspace model indexer:

* support persistence of the workspace profiles index added in Oxygen
* divide initial indexing of a project into a discovery phase to
  find files to be indexed and a separate phase to index them to
  reduce the duration of a project lock.  Even so, let the user
  cancel the discovery phase if it blocks the UI (it runs again
  automatically)
* when indexing files, process them in chucks to avoid locking large
  numbers at one time
* on initialization of the index, if it was loaded from persistent
  store, don't even scan the project looking for resources to index.
  The workspace's resource synchronization will trigger index updates
  as necessary

> Uploaded patch set 2.

I finally managed to get a Papyrus configuration that works properly in the Palette Customization dialog.  I can confirm that the workspace profiles index still works correctly with this patch (which now fixes the bundle manifest to add the missing dependency).

Thanks for your guidance Mickael.  And nice work on the Stereotype Explorer dialog, btw!

Good job!
I succesfully tested with a new workspace. I was about to add +2, when I realized that Papyrus does not start anymore on an old workspace. Not yet sure, if this problem is related to the patch or not.

I tested the patch and perf looks better but 
 - how are we certain that the cache is still working correctly?
 - it's sill blocking the exit (20s) and launch an exception when exited (more info in bug description)

Is this something that can/should be merged between RC3 and RC4 remains an open question.

I just sent a email to share the question on the dev list.
In short, if only Ed and I complains then the best would be to merge it right AFTER RC4

Regarding my earlier remark: I get the same NPE (resulting in a non starting Eclipse) with or without this patch. Thus, it's not related to this patch. Sorry, for not confirming this earlier, I was in a meeting all morning.

@Benoit: yes, a good idea to get feedback from the mailing list. Personally, I think, it would be a pity not to have this performance improvement in the release.

Thanks for the update, Ansgar.  Is the NPE in the indexer?  If so, it does still worry me.  Perhaps you could send details off-line?

It was in in the Papyrus editor (oep.infra.ui), not in the indexer. I can't reproduce it anymore.

I removed the +1 by mistake in my previous post, sorry.

Hi Christian,

can you please rebase the patch (there is a conflict) and remove the unused import?
