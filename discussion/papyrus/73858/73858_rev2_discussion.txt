DESCRIPTION:

Bug 436665: [CSS] Refresh issue when an element is moved to a different owner
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=436665

Ensure that the element-adapter containment is refreshed whenever
notation view containment changes.

As a related (similar) problem, also fix stale CSS Engines without
parent engine (or other important state) remaining on some notation
views that had initialized their CSS support during creation of a
diagram, before it was attached to the resource (therefore not having
the Model Engine).  The root diagram would replace its engine on
attachment to the resource, but not its contained views.

(cherry-picked from master)
