DESCRIPTION:

Bug 528439 [AFViewpoints][Palettes] Custom palettes from two different
diagram configurations for different viewpoint are showing up if the
configurations have same name.

- Merged ADElements based on id rather than qualified name
- Removed the ViewpointPrototype.UNAVAILABLE_VIEW singleton and replaced
it with null, since half the code was checking it and the other half was
checking null; It is safer to check for null every where.
- Changed the ViewpointFilter to check whether the prototype is in view,
instead of checking if a prototype can be retrieved.
- Moved the ViewpointFilter class from
ui.architecture to to the viewpoins.policy plugin  to clean plugin
dependencies.
- Added a an RepresentationKinUtils API in the architecture plugin to
get the RepresentationKind from a representation.
- Enabled closing sash pages for representations that are not currently
supported by the current viewpoints.
- Removed considering subtypes of representation kinds when looking up a
prototype for a representation, since only the same representation or
one of its super types should be allowed.
