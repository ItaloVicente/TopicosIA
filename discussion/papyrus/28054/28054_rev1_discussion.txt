This is just a draft, including the current state of work discussed in Bug 436468

The "Create Papyrus model from existing UML model" wizard is still partially broken (It creates a local *.sash file, which is not used, and doesn't properly initializes the preference store *.sash model)

This looks like a good start.

I do have a concern about controlled units, though.  It makes sense that there should be exactly one *.sash resource matched with the root model resource when the model is decomposed into sub-units, because the "team" conflict scenarios don't apply.  But, unless I'm mistaken, a controlled unit (especially if it's a package) can be opened in its own editor.  Would it not, then, implicitly create its own *.sash?  And that would then store references to diagrams.  Should this be accounted for in some way by editors for containing units?  Perhaps not.  I would be inclined to think not, because the *.sash should logically correspond to an editor, not to a model.  But how did it work with *.di resources?
Line:108, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/resource/sasheditor/SashModel.java -> This forumlation suggests that 'this.resource' could be null, otherwise 'return this.resource == resource' would be sufficient.  Under what circumstances would 'this.resource' be null?  Can it, even?

The former DI was slightly different: there were a single Sash model, but multiple "Page list" (The page list was controlled). Now, the page list doesn't exist anymore (More precisely, it is derived).

What should happen today is that if you open the specific sub-model, it should have its own Sash model. If you open the main model, it should also have its own (different) Sash model.

If you are using both the main and controlled model (with their own sash model), you may end up with invalid diagrams being referenced from sash models (Especially when you delete a diagram from the submodel, then open it from the main model). The only consequence is an "invalid tab" in the editor, which can simply be closed. This is minor enough to be ignored IMO (Although this wouldn't happen if the Sash Model loaded all available *.sash resources)

(BTW, there might be some bugs related to the control mode: the diagrams may not always be stored in the proper notation resource. But that's a separate issue (Related to the control mode, not to the sash model))
Line:108, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/resource/sasheditor/SashModel.java -> This is not clear to me yet. It is null during model loading, but I'm not completely sure what this means. I added the null check to be safe (i.e. "Even if I'm not loaded yet, a null resource is not related to me")

This may or may not be a problem, I didn't properly check yet.
