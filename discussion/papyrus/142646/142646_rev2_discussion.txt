DESCRIPTION:

Bug 542802: [SequenceDiagram] Undo after message creation removes other
elements from the model

- Manage the undo manually because an action was done silently after the
command execution that's re-order the items in interaction or
interaction operand, so the undo delete the wrong elements.
