Good improvment but still there are thing missing I think. some I've commented on the files. 

Also the major thing missing is the description of the properties of the elements in a configuration file, e.g. the properties of a diagram, like affected by, governs etc
Line:55, plugins/doc/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.doc/resources/viewpoints.mediawiki -> Should it be ''...wizard is populated with _only_ the diagrams and tables..." here as well as the bulle below regarding the contextual menus?

Or maybe this depends on whether the provided viewpoint extends or replicate the UML and SysML diagrams, ad pointed out in step 4 in the Walktrough?

Line:176, plugins/doc/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.doc/resources/viewpoints.mediawiki -> I still have a hard time to understand the descriptions below. Since the rules are quite essential, I think this section need to be elaborated a bit more. 

E.g. The description of model rules and owning rules are the same so it is hard to see how e.g. the use of each 'multiplicity' differ.

The attributes that do not appear in the documentation are inherited from the ISO 42010 implementation. They are currently NOT used by Papyrus and thus have no Papyrus-specific semantic.

Hence, should we mention in the documentation they are to be ignored? or copy the documentation from ISO 42010? both?

Maybe just add something like you wrote ("The attributes that do not appear in the documentation are inherited from the ISO 42010 implementation. They are currently NOT used by Papyrus and thus have no Papyrus-specific semantic.") to make it clear and also be clear on which attributes that are required.

The important thing is that it is clear to the user which attibutes (s)he needs to use and why (=the meaning)
