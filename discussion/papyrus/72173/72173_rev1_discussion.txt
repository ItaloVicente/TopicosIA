DESCRIPTION:

Bug 492482: [Stereotype Display] Undo of "Show all related links" failure for stereotyped connectors (with model corruption)
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=492482

Try as much as necessary to make the undo/redo scenario of dropping
Capsules to create CapsuleParts in Papyrus-RT Capsule State Machines
work.  That is, not to fail to undo with an index-out-of-bounds
exception in undoing a ListChange in the ChangeDescription.

Several things:

* add new preferred command execution utilities in GMFUnsafe that
  will execute the command in the context of an existing read/write
  transaction if available, instead of an unprotected write
* use this new command utility in the applied-stereotype edit-policies
  to try whenever possible to record the changes for correct undo/redo
* change the class hierarchy of the applied-stereotype edit-policies
  to react to transaction *precommit* notifications from the
  DiagramEventBroker instead of postcommit, again to promtote the
  recording of changes as much as possible for undo/redo
* hack the PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy to pass over applied-stereotype
  shapes that it things it should delete from the notation, because
  in fact they are managed by another edit policy and are not of
  "canonical" nature

Note that this patch does include API changes, even technically breaking
changes, after the Neon M7 feature-freeze milestone.  I don't know that
this is the "right" approach to fixing the problem, and I certainly
don't know that it fixes other undo/redo scenarios such as the original
bugzilla report, but I am posting it as a draft for review and
consideration of our options at this late stage.

I don't like my hack of the PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy to avoid interfering with the canonical-like changes made by the stereotype-display edit-policies, but some communication between these two policies as to the ownership of these views is necessary.
