DESCRIPTION:

Bug 492482: [Stereotype Display] Undo of "Show all related links" failure for stereotyped connectors (with model corruption)
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=492482

Try as much as necessary to make the undo/redo scenario of dropping
Capsules to create CapsuleParts in Papyrus-RT Capsule State Machines
work.  That is, not to fail to undo with an index-out-of-bounds
exception in undoing a ListChange in the ChangeDescription.

Several things:

* add a new mix-in interface for edit-policies that perform
  automatic edits to the notation model à la CanonicalEditPolicy
  with operations for execution of commands that prefer to reuse a
  read/write transaction if available, instead of an unprotected write
* use this new protocol in the applied-stereotype edit-policies
  to try whenever possible to record the changes for correct undo/redo
* change the class hierarchy of the applied-stereotype edit-policies
  to react to transaction *precommit* notifications from the
  DiagramEventBroker instead of postcommit, again to promtote the
  recording of changes as much as possible for undo/redo
* update the default canonical child views strategy to enable
  registration of view types that it should not attempt to manage
* use the new view-type filtering mechanism to exclude applied-
  stereotype views from canonical control

Note that this patch does include API changes, even technically breaking
changes, after the Neon M7 feature-freeze milestone.

This update fixes the problem in the applied-stereotype edit-policies of not receiving the stereotype application/unapplication notifications that they expect.  JUnit coverage of these edit-policies and of the StereotypeElementListener in which that problem was fixed gives me some confidence in this patch.

File Comment: plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> I think this modification to StereotypeElementListener introduces a subtle regression:
Upon undo, a STEREOTYPE_UNAPPLIED_FROM_ELEMENT may now be sent while the stereotype is still applied, because the notifications "injected" by the fake command will be the first to be sent upon undo, whereas they were last before this modifications.
The STEREOTYPE_APPLIED_TO_ELEMENT meaning "a stereotype was applied" is "inverted" as a STEREOTYPE_UNAPPLIED_FROM_ELEMENT meaning "a stereotype *is about* to be unapplied" (and not "*was* unapplied").

In SCADE System, we have one property page IObservable related to stereotypes that uses AbstractStereotypeListener and is impacted by this modification (display in the page is inconsistent after undo).
