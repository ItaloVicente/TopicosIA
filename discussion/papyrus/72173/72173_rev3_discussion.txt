DESCRIPTION:

Bug 492482: [Stereotype Display] Undo of "Show all related links" failure for stereotyped connectors (with model corruption)
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=492482

Try as much as necessary to make the undo/redo scenario of dropping
Capsules to create CapsuleParts in Papyrus-RT Capsule State Machines
work.  That is, not to fail to undo with an index-out-of-bounds
exception in undoing a ListChange in the ChangeDescription.

Several things:

* add new preferred command execution utilities in GMFUnsafe that
  will execute the command in the context of an existing read/write
  transaction if available, instead of an unprotected write
* use this new command utility in the applied-stereotype edit-policies
  to try whenever possible to record the changes for correct undo/redo
* change the class hierarchy of the applied-stereotype edit-policies
  to react to transaction *precommit* notifications from the
  DiagramEventBroker instead of postcommit, again to promtote the
  recording of changes as much as possible for undo/redo
* hack the PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy to pass over applied-stereotype
  shapes that it things it should delete from the notation, because
  in fact they are managed by another edit policy and are not of
  "canonical" nature

Note that this patch does include API changes, even technically breaking
changes, after the Neon M7 feature-freeze milestone.  I don't know that
this is the "right" approach to fixing the problem, and I certainly
don't know that it fixes other undo/redo scenarios such as the original
bugzilla report, but I am posting it as a draft for review and
consideration of our options at this late stage.

> This is why we don't like late API-breaking changes! Even though this edit-policy probably shouldn't be API, it is, and changing it broke RobotML. Easy enough to fix, although I don't know how to test RobotML.

RobotML moved to a separate Git repository/build, and is currently being removed from the Papyrus Extra plug-ins (Bug 482244)

Regarding the API change: is it absolutely required to add a new method to GMFUnsafe? I thought it would be sufficient to just "reuse the current Transaction if there is one", which doesn't imply extra APIs; just a new test in the current implementation of write()
Line:201, plugins/infra/emf/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf.gmf/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/emf/gmf/util/GMFUnsafe.java -> The EditingDomain might support Nested Commands, but this doesn't mean that we're actually executed a command at this point. For example, if we're opening a Diagram, we have a read-write transaction (To edit the *.sash model), but it's not a command (Because opening a Diagram shouldn't make the editor dirty), so we don't want to use the Command Stack

In my opinion, if there is an active transaction, then we reuse it (Without using the CommandStack); otherwise we go the unsafe route

Lovely.  So, then, this change when merged would break their build.  Oh, well.

That would change the behaviour for *every* client of this API.  There are lots of call sites.  At this stage, I want to be able to restrict the scope of the change to just the stereotype-application edit-policies.  The deprecations are there to encourage review of the other call sites in the next (Oxygen) release.

If you prefer, I'll be happy to just create a new command-execution utility in the AbstractAppliedStereotypeDisplayEditPolicy and leave GMFUnsafe as it is.  Perhaps that's best.

But note that this isn't the API change that I am most concerned about.  It's not a breaking change.  The breaking change is in the type hierarchy of the AbstractAppliedStereotypeDisplayEditPolicy.
Line:201, plugins/infra/emf/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf.gmf/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/emf/gmf/util/GMFUnsafe.java -> You're right.  I overthought this one and didn't account for the possibility of a normal read/write transaction not created by command execution.  Thanks!
