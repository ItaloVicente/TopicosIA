DESCRIPTION:

Bug 492482: [Stereotype Display] Undo of "Show all related links" failure for stereotyped connectors (with model corruption)
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=492482

Try as much as necessary to make the undo/redo scenario of dropping
Capsules to create CapsuleParts in Papyrus-RT Capsule State Machines
work.  That is, not to fail to undo with an index-out-of-bounds
exception in undoing a ListChange in the ChangeDescription.

Several things:

* add a new mix-in interface for edit-policies that perform
  automatic edits to the notation model à la CanonicalEditPolicy
  with operations for execution of commands that prefer to reuse a
  read/write transaction if available, instead of an unprotected write
* use this new protocol in the applied-stereotype edit-policies
  to try whenever possible to record the changes for correct undo/redo
* change the class hierarchy of the applied-stereotype edit-policies
  to react to transaction *precommit* notifications from the
  DiagramEventBroker instead of postcommit, again to promtote the
  recording of changes as much as possible for undo/redo
* update the default canonical child views strategy to enable
  registration of view types that it should not attempt to manage
* use the new view-type filtering mechanism to exclude applied-
  stereotype views from canonical control

Note that this patch does include API changes, even technically breaking
changes, after the Neon M7 feature-freeze milestone.

This is a patch that I am happy with, as it introduces a less hacky way to filter stereotype-related views from the CanonicalEditPolicy with a fairly generic mechanism that is confined to the UML sphere.

I'll work next on a back-port to Mars stream and start the API change approval process.

Actually, this patch breaks the applied-stereotype edit-policies.  They rely on the custom "stereotype (un)applied" notifications injected by the StereotypeElementListener.  That listener only does this injection in a post-commit transactional listener, but the edit-policies now react only in the pre-commit phase.

This listener needs to be changed to inject these events in a pre-commit listener.  Which has potentially wide-ranging effect (how many dependencies are there on these custom notifications?)
