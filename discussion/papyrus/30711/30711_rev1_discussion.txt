DnD works : the reverse dialog is shown.
However, I can't see the new options (to select what should be shown in diagram)  in the dialog. Is it the expected behavior ?

The new dialog should have three check-boxes (at the bottom) :
 * display model
 * display packages 
 * display compilation unit

Moreover, when you press "ok" button of this dialog, it should display these elements into the opened papyrus diagram.

I experienced problems using gerrit: it creates conflicts with my previous patches. I hope it really pushed my entire patch; I try to fix this problem as soon as possible.

Now its working. I also have the additional check boxes.
Is it possible to improve the following:
 - When a class is dropped in the diagram, and the class was already in the diagram, it is drawned another time (the class appears more than one time).
 - When several classes, or a folder is dropped in the diagram, all classes are drawn at the same position. Is it possible to draw them at different positions. Maybe it is possible to use one of the distribution action (context menu->arrange|distribute|...)

On my version, a class which is already in the diagram is reversed again but not displayed twice into diagram. I suppose there is another conflict or different versions between my local branch and the Gerrit repo, but I don't know why.

I looked for a command which automatically moves components into diagram, but I don't found it yet.
