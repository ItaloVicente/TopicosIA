DESCRIPTION:

Bug 513267: [State machine diagram] Superfluous scrollbars always
present https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=513267

Initialize the height Header of StateMachine to 20 because after the
creation, the CustomStatsMachineNameEditPart refreshed it and
automatically resize it to 20.

When it was initialized to 13, the height of created region was
calculated by the height of the StateMachine minus the size of the
header (so 300 - 13 = 287). And when the header was resized to 20, the
StateMachine was resized to 280. So the Region was taller than the
StateCompartment and the ScollBar was displayed (because 287 in 280
compartment).

While the patch resolves the problem, it would be good to analyse the problem further. Class Zone defines the constant "defaultHeader" with the value 13 (as originally in the diagram creation command). Class CustomStateCreationEditPolicy defines the constant REGION_OFFSET with the value 20. I'd like to understand, if the constant in the state-machine diagram creation command directly depends on one of these two other constants (and if yes, if it could be derived from these).
