DESCRIPTION:

532101: [AFViewpoints] Make AF editor faster
532104: [AFViewpoints] Transform your Workspace reference to platform
reference

- Simplified the AF model wizard by defaulting the root to be
Architecture Domain.
- Extended the Load Resource action in the AF editor to allow loading AF
models from the running platfom.
- Added a Resolve All action that can be used on any object in the
editor to quickly resolve related references. This can be used on a
loaded AF model (from workspace or running platform) to also load its
dependencies like elementtypeconfigurtion and palleteconfiguration
files.
- Refactored uml.architecture, all the elementtypeconfiguration and all
palletteconfiguration models in the code base by changing reference to
their dependencies to relative references. This allows them to be loaded
regardless of whether the AF model is loaded from workspace or from
running platform.

Could you add prefix bug before the number of the bug in order to make gerrit tool able to write automatically  in the bugzilla.

Could you divide for next time your patches  ( for example 1 patch when you only add comments into your EMF model).

I add comments directly on files
File Comment: plugins/uml/architecture/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.architecture/model/uml.architecture -> I do not understand why you change "platform:/plugin" into "../.."
because now if references are not locally in the resource the validation does not runs, it cannot find the resource.
So if I prefer something like that:
the architecture resource try to load references ( exactly as written from "platform:/plugin"). if they are not found, they are loaded localy (from resource).
But when a architecture resource is saved, the resource is saved with "platform:/plugin".
To do that the architecture resource must be overloaded to manage reference saving or loading. We have written for example a basis into org.eclipse.papyrus.emf.resources.AbstractEMFResource.
Line:86, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.service.types/model/uml.elementtypesconfigurations -> If you need to change referece saving .elementtypesconfigurations, I prefer that you change  the resource linked to elementtypesconfigurations as org.eclipse.papyrus.emf.resources.AbstractEMFResource to make the file serializable with any editor.

I think the decision for a resource (like architecture model) to reference its dependencies from the workspace or the platform should be made by the designer of the resource, based on whether these dependencies exist in their code base, or in their target platform. In the first case, the dependencies should be refernced using the relative scheme "../.." and in the second case, they should be referenced using the "plaform/plugin" scheme. In both cases, when a resource is deployed at runtime, all its dependencies will be loaded from the platform. 

This bebahior is consistent with other Ecore-based editors, including the Ecore model editor itself, which extends the Load Resource dialog to allow referencing dependencies from either the workspce or the platform. In this patch, I added this ability to the architecture model editor as well, by extending the Load Resource dialog to allow loading a dependent architectur model from the platform, in addition to the regular load from workspace option. 

Furthermore, for the UML architecture model itself, since it is in the same code base as its dependencies (the elementtypesetconfiguration and palleteconfiguration), I switched all dependencies to relative to the resource, hence with the "../.." scheme.

With regard to the orthogonal issue of AbstractEMFResource, which forces some options on resource save. Is this the recommended approach for all resource types in Papyrus now? I ask because I see only the Expressions resources currently use it. Is there a plan to switch all others? If that is the case, I can switch the architecture resources to use this, but what about other resource types that architecture references as dependencies (e.g., elementtypesetconfiguration, palleteconfiguration, etc.)? Please let me know what is the consensus.
