DESCRIPTION:

Bug 532101: [AFViewpoints] Make AF editor faster
Bug 532104: [AFViewpoints] Transform your Workspace reference to
platform
reference

- Simplified the AF model wizard by defaulting the root to be
Architecture Domain.
- Extended the Load Resource action in the AF editor to allow loading AF
models from the running platfom.
- Added a Resolve All action that can be used on any object in the
editor to quickly resolve related references. This can be used on a
loaded AF model (from workspace or running platform) to also load its
dependencies like elementtypeconfigurtion and palleteconfiguration
files.
- Made the architecture, elementtypesetconfigurtion,
nattableconfiguration, and paletteconfiguration resources extend of a
common base class that supports default load/save options. This base
class also makes the cross references persist using platform:/platform
URIs but upon load, they may  resolve to platform:/resource if the
resource is available in the workspace.
- Refactored uml.architecture, all the elementtypeconfiguration, all
palletteconfiguration, and all nattableconfiguration models by changing
their cross references to platform:/plugin URI format.
- Fixed PasteEObjectConfigurationItemProvider to make the containment
reference axisIdentifier show in the editor/property sheet as a
containment reference (was necessary to convert its cross references
properly)

I implemented the recommendations. However, sometimes, the versions of some projects were already incremented by other changes more than I needed, so I did nothing in those cases.
