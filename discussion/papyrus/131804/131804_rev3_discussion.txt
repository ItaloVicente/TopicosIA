DESCRIPTION:

Bug 539022 - [Releng] Update setup for new release cadence

- The release cadence for Papyrus and the train is no longer
  annual but quarterly.  Photon is no longer in maintenance
  and all development is now on master.  Update the Oomph
  setup model accordingly.
- Remove the Luna, Mars and Neon branches and targlets

sorry about the noise but it seems that Jenkins just does not want to build my gerrit...

Ok so I hit, among some other tidbits that still needed correcting, a roadblock: The clone needs a branch in order to checkout the git. It cannot create the branch with the tag alone, hence we might have to create "dummy branches" in order for the setup to progress correctly.
And yes I see now the extremely long cloning process... I'll look into it too but I cannot see at first glance why its _that_ long.

I don't understand.  Most users will find this setup in the central catalogue via the Oomph Installer.  They don't have to clone Papyrus in order to access it.

It seems that to each 'branch' we need to give it a name. This name is used to, if the user chooses it, clone the repository and checkout the associated branch from which the plugins are imported.
If the branch does not exist this will break the installation (at least from what I've been experiencing) on the 'photon' and '2018-09' that do not correspond to anything. I thought of giving everything master as a test but Oomph will yell at me because multiple branches have the same 'name'. 
If I missed something please correct me though !

Line:535, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> Right, we don't use SWTBot any longer for tests I think (at least, it wasn't referenced as a requirement.  So good to clean this up.

Line:1398, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> Why change the project names?  That makes a discontinuity in the update process from Oxygen (or even Photon).  Developers will have to know that old stream references are obsolete and they need to import these new projects instead, and edit the workspace model to delete the old Oxygen streams.

Line:580, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> Why do we have this Mylyn repository?  It's already out of date (breaking the setup) and there are no references in target requirements to any Mylyn feature.

Line:587, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> Same here.  There is no feature requirement in any target on this repository, so we don't need it (and it also currently breaks the setup process).

Thanks for the feedback I will integrate them asap and push a new version !
Line:580, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> yes it has been updated in my testing version. I thought the mylyn plugin was necessary for the mylyn tasks but if it is not it should be removed idd.

Line:587, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> Yes there too it has been updated in my working environment. I just didn't want to push too many things until I had a stable setup.

Line:1398, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> I did not know this would break existing installations. I will revert it then. I changed the name purely for convenience as I ended up with two 'Releng' working sets and before I figured out I could just look at the setup file text to know which was used I had trouble picking one through the interface when excluding working sets.

Line:587, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> Hah, yes.  I can understand that.

Line:1398, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> Okay, cool, thanks.  The labels can change, that's fine.  The important thing is just the IDs of the projects and the streams, which are used in the HREFs from the workspace setup model.
