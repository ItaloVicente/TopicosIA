DESCRIPTION:

[Releng] Update setup for new release cadence

The release cadence for Papyrus and the train is no longer
annual but quarterly.  Photon is no longer in maintenance
and all development is now on master.  Update the Oomph
setup model accordingly.

Hi CHristian,
Thanks for the patch, I'm currently (finally carved some time for this) working on a patch for the long neglected oomph setup file. I did not think to add the 2018-12 though so I'll merge your patch with this addition. As the old branches, before Oxygen, are most likely not used by anyone I was wondering if they are still useful in there.
You mentioned something like an overly complex/big setup file could end up in missfires and installation problems so I was thinking that this would be the perfect time to do this. Can I put you as a reviewer for the incoming patch though ?

Yeah, it's necessary to correlate p2 and targlet tasks with the simultaneous release version installed into the host workbench by the Oomph Installer, which now is up to 2018-12 and will be renewed four times annually.  That's a lot of setup maintenance.

Agreed.  Neon and Mars, at least, should just be dropped.

I don't remember saying that, but it's true that the performance of the setup editor on this model is quite poor.  My main concern was for testing older streams that I am long out of touch with.

Sure, no problem.  Does that mean we should abandon this change set?

The more I think about it , as I did not yet push anything on gerrit, the simpler solution would be to contribute to this one if that's ok with you.

Okay, sure.  Would you vote a +1 or +2, then? ;-)

for sure :)
I even thought about 2018-12 actually but named it all Master instead of 2018-12.... which I cannot make up my mind about what is the best way to name it, i.e master should speak to most devs but 2018-12 might be better for all the rest.

We have to be careful to use the target platform names that the Eclipse Installer uses for the "active repository list" selector in targlets.  The name "master" is good for a "stream" that specifies the p2 tasks for the host workbench, but not for the targlet repository lists.

Line:1584, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> Yes We still need master (which is indeed still a Photon/4.X, I have trouble viewing the new release process as a continuation - in our case at least - of the old naming scheme) and the last Oxygen branch. The ones that would not be there will be Photon.0 and 4.1.0.

Line:2153, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> Why remove Photon and later streams?  We still have a need for development of the Oomph setup, which requires the Eclipse.ini task to test the setup model.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2153, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> To me master was the latest stream. As Papyrus does not have any tasks linked to the maintenance of older (4.0.0 and 4.1.0) branches they do not currently exist in the repository.
