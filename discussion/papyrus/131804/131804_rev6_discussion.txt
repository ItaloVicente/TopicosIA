DESCRIPTION:

Bug 539022 - [Releng] Update setup for new release cadence

- The release cadence for Papyrus and the train is no longer
  annual but quarterly.  Photon is no longer in maintenance
  and all development is now on master.  Update the Oomph
  setup model accordingly.
- Remove the Luna, Mars and Neon branches and targlets
- Removed the devlopper tool working set that was empty
- Added new filters to populate toolsmiths and releng working sets for Oxygen and 2018-12 (master)
- Removed all other targets as those are the only ones with actual git branches
- updated some of the targlets adresses

It works for me, for the fairly minimal Papyrus workspace that I maintain.

My only concern is about the removal of Targlet repository lists for the 2018-09 release (as referenced by the Oomph Installer as a target platform version).  I understand that this version of Papyrus is, like Photon, no longer in maintenance because now all development is just on master that releases four times a year.  But, what happens if a user selects this target platform in the installer is that a correct and complete PDE Target for Papyrus development cannot be provisioned.  That's not great.  But, I don't know what to do about it because we'll have the same problem for 2018-12 platform when 2019-03 development begins and later for 2019-03 platform when 2019-06 opens for development, etc.  I expect we'll have to document somehow that this Oomph setup can only be used with the latest target platform selection in the Installer, but I think there's no way to enforce this.  Perhaps this should be discussed with the Oomph team ...

I agree this is and will be problematic... I posted an inquiry about cloning from a tag in the oomph's mailing list but didn't get a response yet (found a bug on it too but no ETA on the resolution). It might warrant a look into a fix but I do not know when I will have the time to sift through oomph's code nor if I will be able to produce such a fix.
I did not look into a possible execution of git commands after the checkout of an existing branch either... although this seems too jerry-rigged to be a permanent solution.

As the query (ML and Bug) has not yet been addressed, and if no one objects to the refactoring, I will merge this contribution tomorrow as M3 is around the corner and it would be nice if we had a working oomph setup file :)
Cheers
