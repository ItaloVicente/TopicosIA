DESCRIPTION:

Bug 539022 - [Releng] Update setup for new release cadence

- The release cadence for Papyrus and the train is no longer
  annual but quarterly.  Photon is no longer in maintenance
  and all development is now on master.  Update the Oomph
  setup model accordingly.
- Remove the Luna, Mars and Neon branches and targlets
- Removed the devlopper tool working set that was empty
- Added new filters to populate toolsmiths and releng working sets for Oxygen and 2018-12 (master)
- Removed all other targets as those are the only ones with actual git branches
- updated some of the targlets adresses
