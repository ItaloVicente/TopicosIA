Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

The new UI looks great!  We've almost nailed it.  :-)

The API compatibility still has some issues (see in-line comments) and I think there may be problems in the new ProfileApplication label and content providers.

My comments are on Patch 2.  Patch 3 came in while I was working on Patch 2.

Even if comments are on Patch #2, I didn't see them neither in Web UI nor in Mylyn connector. Sorry

Grrr.  The problem is that once the Patch Set 3 was uploaded, all of my comments on Patch Set 2 became zombies.  They can't be submitted.  They can't even be *accessed* in the web UI (Gerrit's web UI has always been terrible, but it has actually *regressed* in the ability to manage drafts).

So, I have manually retyped all of my comments into Patch Set 3.  (the only way I could access them at all is Mylyn's Review view, which thankfully displays these zombie draft comments, but doesn't offer a Copy action.  Grrr)
Line:21, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/definition/IPapyrusVersionConstants.java -> Thanks for keeping the old API.  There's just one problem:  it is necessary not to delete the fields of the interface because they may still be referenced by client code, since references to static members encode the precise type that declares those members.

Of course, in this case, one would usually expect the Java compiler to in-line these string values into the referencing class's constant pool, but you never know.  Best not to delete these fields but just to deprecate them.

Line:17, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/definition/PapyrusDefinitionAnnotation.java -> Ditto the parseEAnnotation(...) method, which should just delegate to the method in the new class.

Line:17, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/definition/PapyrusDefinitionAnnotation.java -> Same comment about public static members that may be referenced by existing clients, except in this case it definitely matters because the UNDEFINED_ANNOTATION field was not a string or primitive type, so existing code will have references to the field's definition in the PapyrusDefinitionAnnotation class.

Line:41, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/definition/ProfileRedefinition.java -> As commented previously, all of these public static methods need to be retained (deprecated, delegating to their new versions) for API compatibility.

Line:21, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/definition/Version.java -> And the static parseVersion(...) method, here.

Line:106, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/providers/ProfileApplicationContentProvider.java -> What about the parent of a ProfileApplication?

Line:46, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/providers/ProfileApplicationLabelProvider.java -> This must be disposed in the ProfileApplicationLabelProvider's dispose() method.

Line:153, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/providers/ProfileApplicationLabelProvider.java -> Shouldn't this be checking for instanceof ProfileApplication?

Line:175, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/providers/ProfileApplicationLabelProvider.java -> And this, too.  Both of these would want to navigate the profile application's appliedProfile to get the name and image from the umlLabelProvider.

Line:508, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/ui/dialogs/ProfileDefinitionDialog.java -> This cast shouldn't be necessary, I think (we should have that compiler warning turned on, actually ...)
