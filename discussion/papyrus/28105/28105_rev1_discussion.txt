Why is it necessary to move the API from the org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile.definition package to the org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools.profile.definition package?  This is a breaking API change for other clients of that API and is not something we could do in the Luna service releases, at least not without also retaining the current API in its current package for some kind of compatibility layer.

Moreover, I don't see how this will work for migration of profile applications on packages that aren't the root package of the model.  As explained in an in-line comment, the presentation of Profiles in the RefreshProfileDialog's tree (with a label provider for them) needs to be replaced by instead presenting ProfileApplications in that tree (with an appropriate label provider which then can show the currently applied version and version that will be applied by the upgrade).
Line:55, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/providers/AppliedProfileLabelProvider.java -> An "applied profile" label-provider that purports to show the applied version of the profile must be a label-provider for ProfileApplication elements, not for Profile elements, because only the ProfileApplication has the context of which package the profile is applied to (it is not necessarily applied to the model's root package!).  It is not meaningful to try to present applied version information for a Profile without that applying-package context.

Line:66, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/providers/AppliedProfileLabelProvider.java -> To me the name ?previousProfileVersion? suggests the version of the profile that was previously applied to a package, but this code actually provides the version number of the latest profile definition.  So, perhaps this should be called ?latestVersion? or some such?  Unless I?m misunderstanding what this does ...

Line:111, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/providers/AppliedProfileLabelProvider.java -> This will NPE for profiles that aren't applied to the root package, but instead to some nested package (which is a fully supported use case).

Line:131, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/providers/AppliedProfileLabelProvider.java -> So, what is case 1, now?  These column indices should probably be documented.  Why does column 1 get neither text nor an image?

Line:166, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/service/ReapplyProfilesService.java -> This looks like we are applying the same profile twice to the same package.  Why?

Line:224, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/databinding/ProfileApplicationObservableList.java -> Again, we're applying the same profile twice to the same package. Only this time it?s exactly the same command.

I needed to move API because I wanted to use same annotation to track applied profile version in model. The envisaged other solution has been to create a specific annotation. IMO, this solution duplicates Papyrus version annotation.

The argument about "Luna service releases" is completely receivable so the envisaged solution will be the best ?

If I really understood your suggestion about label provider. The "Profile" label provider should be improved in "Profile Application" label provider to about  display of profile version ?
Line:166, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/service/ReapplyProfilesService.java -> The first command applies profile on the model and the second saves the version of applied profile with an annotation. I prefered distinguish both actions.

Line:224, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/databinding/ProfileApplicationObservableList.java -> It is an error of mine. Good look !

Ah, interesting.  I think it could be valuable to have the applied version recorded on the ProfileApplication, especially for the Stereotype Repair scenario in which the applied profile cannot be resolved.  This would provide more useful information to help a user decide how to proceed with repair.  Nice!

Well, the first question to answer is whether the affected APIs are explicitly published by Papyrus as API.  It seems that at least some of the Papyrus classes that match Eclipse's conventions for what is public API are not supported by Papyrus as public API in 1.0.0.  So, I don't know how to answer.

Right.  In the tree that currently shows the model's package structure with the applied profiles as children of each package, it should show instead the profile-applications as children of each package.  These profile-applications, then, can have a label provider that populates the other table columns, especially the applied-version column.  Presenting just the profiles, it is impossible to determine the applied version because different packages can have different versions of the same profile applied!
Line:166, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/service/ReapplyProfilesService.java -> Ah, I see.  I thought it might be a refactoring/upgrade of the ApplyProfileCommand, as the name seemed to indicate the same thing.  I agree that it's useful to separate these concepts, certainly if we want to be able to apply profiles without also this new annotation.  But if we want to enforce the annotation, it may be better to combine these in one command?  I'm on the fence on this point ...
