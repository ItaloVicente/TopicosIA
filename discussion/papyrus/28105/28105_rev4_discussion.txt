I fixed issues for providers but I am less sure about corrections for API compatibility despite your review. It is possible that there are yet some errors, I don't hope.

I found a couple of small issues in the profile-application label provider in testing (old version showing 0.0.0 when it can get the annotation from the Ecore definition and getText(...) not covering as many cases as getStyledText(...)).

Since some of the remaining issues are my fault, I've prepared an updated patch set to address all of my comments.

Thanks, Gabriel!  This is ready to go as soon as I get my patch set up.
Line:65, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/definition/PapyrusDefinitionAnnotation.java -> Oops, sorry.  I take the responsibility for some bad advice, here.  Delegation doesn't really work when the return result is supposed to be the deprecated type that now is a subclass.

Line:68, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/definition/Version.java -> Same here (a cast actually would fail).

Line:87, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/profile/providers/ProfileApplicationContentProvider.java -> Augh! I wish it had occurred to me sooner ... UML Components can contain packages (they're basically classes that have packaging semantics).  A package contained by a component can have profiles applied.  That should be accounted for here, although it is probably such an outlier case (components much more often contain other components than packages) that I'm happy to leave it for another bugzilla.
