The mapping should correspond to the role of the label, so "Side Affixed Node Label" should not be used here

Examples of existing mappings are "Label:name", "Label:sourceRole", "Label:targetMultiplicity", i.e. they represent the semantic role of the Label.

The only exception is "Floating Label", which I don't like either, so let's not copy that :)

If the roles cannot be guessed automatically, then maybe some extra information is required in the GenModel.

The role should be the same one that is displayed in the "Filter > Manage Connector Labels" context menu (In this specific case, the menu doesn't seem to be available at all)

IMO, the right fix would be to add the "Label Visibility Preferences" entries in the GenModels when they are missing. Templates and Context Menus already rely on this information to display the label and generate the NotationTypesMapping, so that would be maintain consistency
