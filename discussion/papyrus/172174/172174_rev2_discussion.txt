Patch Set 2:

Patch set 2 is ready for review. It adds the 2012-12 target platform for master branch development, which seems to work for me with the latest 2020-12 Modeling Package.

Also a couple of changes to streamline the maintenance of the setup model:
- no need to ask the user to select the only CBI Aggregation model in the workspace
- best prefix match to simplify "updateFrom" annotations, so that they don't have to be edited every time an aggregated component changes from (e.g.) "OCL for 2020-09" to "OCL for 2020-12"

Quentin, could I ask for your input on this? I know that it's almost too late now for Papyrus 5.0, but I hope this may give us a good start for whatever will be the next release after that.

Hi Christian, No problem on merging your patch for the RC. I even would have been more drastic and deleted setups prior to 2020-06 but it might still be fine to keep them at least for now.
There were some update on the dependencies during M3 so I would not object to an update of the master setup ^^
