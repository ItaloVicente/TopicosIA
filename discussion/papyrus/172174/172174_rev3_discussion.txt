> Hi Christian, No problem on merging your patch for the RC. I even would have been more drastic and deleted setups prior to 2020-06 but it might still be fine to keep them at least for now.
> There were some update on the dependencies during M3 so I would not object to an update of the master setup ^^

Thanks, Quentin! Patch set 3 incorporates the latest M3 dependency updates from the aggregation model.

My remark about being too late for 5.0 was only meant to suggest that this would be too late to be useful to developers working on Papyrus 5.0, not that it would be too late to accept the contribution. Although, it should equally well serve to get people started on the first release of 2021.

Thanks, Quentin! Much appreciated.

I've not really been following the discussion about moving the aggregation from b3 to Tycho. If and when that happens, I'd be interested in helping with contribution of dependency tooling updates in Papyrus, which would apply not only to the setup model but also to the target platform definitions.

Apart from the typo in the main, the Releng tools cannot be installed because of a dependecy/fetch problem on mikael tpd updater tool. It does not seem to be related to the dependecies (afaict).
Line:696, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> This seems like a typo. I'd guess a strange sed behavior?

Yes this could induce very interesting changes !

Oh, right. That works for me because I still have it cached from long ago, so Oomph is happy to use the cached version. I think this is now available at Eclipse.org, so I'll try to update the reference.
Line:696, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> Ack
