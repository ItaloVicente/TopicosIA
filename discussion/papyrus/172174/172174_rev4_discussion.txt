Last time I swear ! It still has trouble installing because of dependecies to org.eclipse.papyrus.editor.feature. Adding the sdk to the Releng Tools p2 seems to solve this but it seems overkill. We really should declare more features !
Sorry about that.

Hmmm. Are you trying to install just the "Releng Tools" without also the "Core Development Tools". I don't think that's a supported configuration. It is expected that the developer using this setup model at least install the Core Development Tools, because that has the Papyrus SDK that's need to edit the models in the source projects. And you get that by selecting the top-level "Papyrus" node in the Oomph Projects tree, which also is the minimum requirement (you can uncheck all of the does below it to avoid importing all of the source projects from Git).

I might indeed be doing something wrong as I keep getting the same error :

I'm testing it by going in Oomph's advanced mode, browsing the patched setup file and selecting everything. All works well if Main and Dev>oomph are selected but crashes upon selecting Releng (either alone or with as I get the same error).

Ah, well, the Dev/Oomph project has to be selected when importing the test version from the local git checkout because otherwise on re-start, the setup will continue with the "official" version published in the Oomph index at Eclipse.org. So that certainly would break.

I'll try a few more stand-alone installation scenarios to see if I can reproduce this problem. Thanks for your patience!

Not a problem at all. I'm the one asking you too ^^'
Thanks again for the dev.
