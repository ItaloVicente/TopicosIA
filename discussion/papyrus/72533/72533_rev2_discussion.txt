DESCRIPTION:

Bug 492482: [Stereotype Display] Undo of "Show all related links" failure for stereotyped connectors (with model corruption)
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=492482

(ported from master [Neon])

Try as much as necessary to make the undo/redo scenario of dropping
Capsules to create CapsuleParts in Papyrus-RT Capsule State Machines
work.  That is, not to fail to undo with an index-out-of-bounds
exception in undoing a ListChange in the ChangeDescription.

Several things:

* add a new mix-in interface for edit-policies that perform
  automatic edits to the notation model à la CanonicalEditPolicy
  with operations for execution of commands that prefer to reuse a
  read/write transaction if available, instead of an unprotected write
* use this new protocol in the applied-stereotype edit-policies
  to try whenever possible to record the changes for correct undo/redo
* change the applied-stereotype edit-policies to use a private
  pre-commit listener on the DiagramEventBroker to react to
  changes within a transaction instead of post-commit, again to promote
  the recording of changes as much as possible for undo/redo
* update the default canonical child views strategy to enable
  registration of view types that it should not attempt to manage
* use the new view-type filtering mechanism to exclude applied-
  stereotype views from canonical control

Note that this patch does include API changes, but not breaking
changes, in a maintenance release.

So, of course, in the end I wasn't at all happy with actually breaking API, so this update fixes that.  The AbstractAppliedStereotypeDisplayEditPolicy now doesn't remove the GMF NotificationListener from the type hierarchy but instead uses a private NotificationPreCommitListener to handle notifications before transaction commit.  So, dependents such as SOAML and RobotML don't need to change.

I have reviewed patch set #2 for Mars,
and it looks very good to me. Thanks very much!
I will vote +1 as soon as I have merged it into our custom Mars-based branch and checked that it works fine.
