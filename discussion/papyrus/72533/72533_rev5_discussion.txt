DESCRIPTION:

Bug 492482: [Stereotype Display] Undo of "Show all related links" failure for stereotyped connectors (with model corruption)
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=492482

(ported from master [Neon])

Try as much as necessary to make the undo/redo scenario of dropping
Capsules to create CapsuleParts in Papyrus-RT Capsule State Machines
work.  That is, not to fail to undo with an index-out-of-bounds
exception in undoing a ListChange in the ChangeDescription.

Several things:

* add a new mix-in interface for edit-policies that perform
  automatic edits to the notation model à la CanonicalEditPolicy
  with operations for execution of commands that prefer to reuse a
  read/write transaction if available, instead of an unprotected write
* use this new protocol in the applied-stereotype edit-policies
  to try whenever possible to record the changes for correct undo/redo
* change the applied-stereotype edit-policies to use a private
  pre-commit listener on the DiagramEventBroker to react to
  changes within a transaction instead of post-commit, again to promote
  the recording of changes as much as possible for undo/redo
* update the default canonical child views strategy to enable
  registration of view types that it should not attempt to manage
* use the new view-type filtering mechanism to exclude applied-
  stereotype views from canonical control
* update all of the CommandUtil APIs for command execution that are
  only used by the applied-stereotype display controllers to piggy-
  back on the active read/write transaction if there is one, for
  plausible undo/redo support

Note that this patch does include API changes, but not breaking
changes, in a maintenance release.

> Uploaded patch set 5.

This update fixes the roll-back exceptions in manipulation of the stereotype display properties in the Property Sheet.

I observed that the command-execution APIs in the CommandUtil class that all unconditionally perform them in unprotected transactions were, in fact, only used by the new applied-stereotype visualization framework (edit-policies, view-provider, annotation migration edit-policies, and related utilities).  Indeed, these APIs were introduced together with that entire framework.

So, I changed these to piggy-back on an existing read/write transaction where possible.

This fixes the roll-back problems, but there remains an issue that has me stumped.  if I make change in the Property Sheet that causes a new applied-stereotype view to appear (comment, compartment in comment, compartment in the element's own shape, whatever) and undo, the new view(s) disappear(s) as expected.  Redo brings it/them back.  Undo, redo, etc. in alternation work just fine.

The problem is when I make a change in the Property Sheet that causes any such applied-stereotype view to *disappear*.  In this case, undo does not restore the view to visibility in the diagram editor.  From what I can tell in debugging, all changes in the notation model are correctly undone because they were correctly recorded in the first place.  But for some reason the visuals in the editor just don't reflect that.

In fact, I can confirm that this is an independent problem.  I observe the same behaviour in the Property Sheet and diagram editor on the parent commit of this Gerrit patch, so it should be raised as a separate bug and not block our progress here.

I have integrated this latest patch set in SCADE System,
and the undo/redo now works fine on the problematic scenario.
Great work.

Thanks, Alain.  I'm glad this is working for you.  I only hope that it doesn't cause regressions in any of the applied-stereotype presentation.  I have to rely on the team for validation of that aspect, because I am not familiar with the use cases.
