DESCRIPTION:

Bug 425215: Duplicate #include directives

When class uses more than one type from the AnsiCLibrary package,
multiple, identical #include directives are generated.

I've created a utility rule to generate #include directives.  The
parameter to the rule is a string containing the path of the file to be
included.  The rule also fixes a problem where #include's were
specifying system includes (angle-bracket strings) instead of user
includes (quoted strings).

Include directives are now generated in two steps.  In the first step,
all dependencies are examined to create an ordered set of strings with
the include paths.  In the second step the new utility rule is used to
generate the directive.

Patch Set 2:

This updated patch wraps the #include directive generation in a check to confirm that the path is not the empty string.

While working on this I ran into problems where multiple copies of the oclstdlib model were loaded.  This caused the rule to fail with an exception.

Running "Acceleo - Reset Driver" at the start of the session is a way to work around this problem.  I think it is only an issue in the runtime workbench, not in a binary installation.

I have a change that fixes the runtime workbench (I'll submit separately).
