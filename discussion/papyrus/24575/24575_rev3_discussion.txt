DESCRIPTION:

Bug 425215: Duplicate #include directives

When class uses more than one type from the AnsiCLibrary package,
multiple, identical #include directives are generated.

I've created a utility rule to generate #include directives.  The
parameter to the rule is a string containing the path of the file to be
included.  The rule also fixes a problem where #include's were
specifying system includes (angle-bracket strings) instead of user
includes (quoted strings).

Include directives are now generated in two steps.  In the first step,
all dependencies are examined to create an ordered set of strings with
the include paths.  In the second step the new utility rule is used to
generate the directive.

Patch Set 3: Verified-1

After applying the patch, includes are missing for interfaces (probably types in general) appearing the operation signature. For instance, the Qompass HelloWorld example produces a file called Cstart.h

The include directive for the interface IStart was generated before and is now missing.

class Cstart {
public:
	/**
	 * 
	 * @param ret 
	 */
	virtual ::sysinterfaces::IStart* get_start() = 0;
};
