DESCRIPTION:

Bug 425215: Duplicate #include directives

When class uses more than one type from the AnsiCLibrary package,
multiple, identical #include directives are generated.

I've created a utility rule to generate #include directives.  The
parameter to the rule is a string containing the path of the file to be
included.  The rule also fixes a problem where #include's were
specifying system includes (angle-bracket strings) instead of user
includes (quoted strings).

Include directives are now generated in two steps.  In the first step,
all dependencies are examined to create an ordered set of strings with
the include paths.  In the second step the new utility rule is used to
generate the directive.

CppClassIncludeDeclaration.mtl had place-holder code on line 24.  I've replace it and looked through the rest of the patch to look for similar problems.

The patch looks good (tested with Qompass examples). However, it does not include the EMTL files that must currently be copied into the src folder for the Hudson build.
