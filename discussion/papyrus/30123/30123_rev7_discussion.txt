Looks good. 

A few minor issues:

1) When both adding and removing a provided/required interface at the same time:

- Type a Port with a Class
- Create a few interfaces
- Add a provided interface to the Port: OK
- Reopen the dialog, and remove the previous interface, and add a new one (In the same dialog): The new interface is added, but the previous one is not removed

2) When deleting a set of provided or required interfaces:

- Type a port with a Class
- Create a few interfaces
- Add all interfaces as "Provided" (or required) interfaces
- In the properties view, select all the provided interfaces and press "remove selected elements": Only one Interface Realization is deleted from the model. The other ones are modified so that they don't have a "supplier" anymore, but they are still present in the model
