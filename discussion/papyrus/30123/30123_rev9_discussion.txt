Avoid introducing a dependency to gmf.diagram.ui from uml.tools. Use only GMF ICommands instead of multi-wrapping GMF, GEF or EMF commands. Especially, the "DestroyDependencyWithoutSuppliedCommand" has been fixed

Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

The delete provided/required interfaces seems to destroy random links (InterfaceRealization or Usage).

When an Interface is provided by more than one Port, and I remove all the provided interfaces from one port, one of the shared interfaces is deleted from the other port.

Steps:

- Create 2 ports with provided interfaces (The ports should be typed with different classes)
- The ports should have at least one "provided interface" in common
- Select a port and remove all its "provided interfaces"

- In some cases, the shared provided interface remains, but is removed from the other port
