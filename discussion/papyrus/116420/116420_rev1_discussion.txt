DESCRIPTION:

Bug 527181 - [Composite structure diagram] Initial port location on a part is top-left corner

- Add possibility to override the initial port poisition in ShowHidecontentsAction
- Create a custom port position for the composite-structure diagram that locates
  the diagram for the defining type (if any) and copies port positions from there. Based
  on similar code in PapyrusRT
- Add a new edit policy "CompositeSideAffixedNodesCreation".
- Deactivate arrange in the canonical edit policy, in order to assure a good layout
  if the canonical edit policy is activated on an existing part. This needs to be revised
  in the context of Bug 527878.

Patch Set 1:

@Asma, there are two things I'd like you to check in particular:

- Should we remove the patch of the canonical edit policy from this bug, since the case of activating the canonical edit policy afterwards is perhaps not a very common use case.
- Is there a better solution for deferring the port-position calculation in the CompositeSideAffixedNodesCreation?
