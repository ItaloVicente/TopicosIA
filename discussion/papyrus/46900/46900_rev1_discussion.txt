It looks like we're using two distinct mechanisms here, which in general are not meant to be used together, so I suspect that this contribution is just a workaround.

In general, getValue() is used without an observable (When you want to manipulate the widget directly, with setValue() and getValue()), whereas the observable can be used to automate this. When using an Observable, we usually don't need getValue() at all. However, we should also be able to use both (i.e. call getValue() even when an Observable is used).

My worry is: why do we even have a disposed observable at this point? In the properties view, I would expect 3 possible cases:

- observable is not null, not disposed: we're using binding. modelProperty != null should be sufficient
- observable was set, then we switched selection. The observable has been disposed but the widget is reused. It seems we're in this case. I would expect the new observable to be passed to the widget (It's not the case: the widget still refers to the old observable)
- observable is never set, and we only use getValue() + setValue(). In this case, modelProperty != null should be sufficient

So if we're in case 2, I think the new observable is not properly passed to the ReferenceDialog, for some reason. This reason should be identified & fixed. Checking for modelProperty#isDisposed seems to be only a workaround to that other issue
