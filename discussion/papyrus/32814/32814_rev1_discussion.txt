Patch Set 1:

Hotspot analysis revealed that by far the greatest cost of refreshing the Model Explorer tree was in calculating overrides of facet features.  In a certain scenario, the current Papyrus build spent more than 24000 milliseconds (that is, more than 24 seconds) in the CustomizedTreeContentProvider::getChildren(EObjectTreeElement) method.  Of this, about 19500 milliseconds were spend in the FacetManagerContext::getOverrideCandidateFeatures(...) method.  That is fully 81.25% of the cost of computing the children of a tree element.

After implementing the cache of feature overrides, hotspot analysis changed dramatically.  For the same scenario, the CustomizedTreeContentProvider::getChildren(EObjectTreeElement) method now only took about 6300 milliseconds, a nearly 4 times performance improvement.  The greatest EMF Facet hotspot remaining after this change is in the DerivedTypedElementManager.evaluateAndCheck(...) method that evaluates a Facet query, clocking in at about 5300 milliseconds.  The practicality of caching query results depends on being able to determine when a result becomes stale due to model changes, which is difficult for arbitrarily complex queries (especially Java queries) that can depend on any number of objects related to the query's target element.  And the performance of this on Mac now is roughly comparable to the amount of time spent painting the explorer tree widget, communicating across the JNI bridge to invoke the native Objective-C runtime's messaging API, and other operations that exhibit the same timings as before.

Ad hoc testing on the obfuscated model attached to bug 441857 and other models shows that when the set of active facets changes (such as when engaging the Advanced Mode), caches of feature overrides are appropriately recalculated and the tree structure always renders correctly (as far as I can tell by comparison with git master).

Works great, thanks!

Regarding the Gerrit failure, I probably missed something when updating the Tycho build yesterday (Source build seems to be missing). Nothing related to the contribution.
