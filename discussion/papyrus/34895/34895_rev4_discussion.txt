I have some concerns on the architecture of this contribution => for me, it means that the views.modelexplorer now specifically depends on gmf.runtime.diagram, and we do in this plugin some specific stuff for the diagrams. Is this correct that the views.modelexplorer depends from the GMF views? In this case, it should also depend from tables or any other kind of "views" possible in the Papyrus editor?

Camille, what do you think?

Technically, the dependency already exists. But indeed; it shouldn't be the case. I haven't looked into the details, but does this work for Diagrams which are stored in an Owner which is not their Context Element? I've seen "owner = diagram.getElement()", but the graphical owner of a Diagram in the Model Explorer is not necessarily it's semantic context.

Steps:

- Create a Diagram on a Package P1
- Drop this Diagram on a Package P2
- Diagram#element = P1, but the Diagram is graphically contained in P2 (Derived "owner")

Now, what happens if you reorder this diagram inside P2?

The diagram is ordered according to Owner, what doesn't modify the semantic context.
