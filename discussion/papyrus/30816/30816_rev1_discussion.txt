DESCRIPTION:

440910: [API] Implement API Tooling builder in Papyrus source projects
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=440910

Add the API tooling to all of the Papyrus main plug-in projects. Not to test plug-ins/fragments nor to Extra plug-ins.

Address API problems of three kinds:

1. Bundle version needs to be updated to 1.1.0.qualifier for added APIs.

2. Missing @since 1.1 Javadoc tags on new APIs (classes, methods, fields).

3. Broken APIs, usually deleted classes, methods, fields.  In code that I understand (because I made the changes or reviewed the Gerrit contribution) I could restore deleted APIs and deprecate them.  In other cases, either because deleted code clearly should never have been API and would not likely have been used or because I don't know the code in question, API filters are employed to excuse the breakage.

Because several bundle versions are updated to 1.1 to reflect added APIs, the JUnit test verifying Papyrus bundle versions is updated to support the 1.1 version.
