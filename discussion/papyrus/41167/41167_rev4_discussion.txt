Dear all,
could you please have a look to the integration of a emfgen maven plugin with constraints plugin.
I have tried to apply the same rules that Christian told me with gitgnore in the src-gen folder. I had to create a sublevel folder that groups all the stuff related to the constraints plugin: for me it is the best pratice.

Overall, I'm happy with the way this is structured (I do have some comments in-line).

There is a use case that's I'm concerned about that doesn't apply here but I know does to other models.  In the models that I created for the Diagram Assistants feature, I used UML2's extended code generation to partition custom code into XyzOperations classes.  Does the emfgen maven plug-in provide some way to account for that?  The nice feature about XyzOperations is that they are basically entirely custom code, so they don't even need regeneration.  But they certainly can't be deleted from the repository nor ignored.

Unfortunately, the UML plug-in does not provide for factoring custom code out of either the XyzValidator nor the XyzItemProvider (edit) classes...
Line:16, plugins/infra/constraints/pom.xml -> It's a bit odd to have the parent POM reaching into the child project's internal directories like this, but then I suppose that's better than having the infra.constraints module generate stuff into its siblings.  Or is it?  I don't know ... I could have it either way, so this is fine.

Line:43, plugins/infra/constraints/pom.xml -> In this context, ${project.basedir} is the constraints module.  I think I understand why this works (the EMF generator actually will output files to paths based on the target project names, relative to this directory) but I had to think twice or thrice about it to see that it's correct.  I wonder if something can be done to make it more obvious?  Or maybe it's not necessary.

Line:86, plugins/infra/constraints/pom.xml -> I suppose this may as well go in the top POM, no?
