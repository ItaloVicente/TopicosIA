Dear all,
I have implemented the different elements to integrate the emfgen maven plugin, to generate at build time the code from a genmodel and an ecore files.
I have integrated the automatic refresh of the src-gen folder in eclipse.
I have integrated the automatic code generation of the edit,model and editor separatly as asked.

Could you have a final :-) look to the proposal?

If you agree with this template, I will do the same for ElementType with the feature agreement of Florian.

Line:23, plugins/infra/constraints/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints/.project -> I thought we had decided not to introduce m2e build in the workspace, or at least we had not yet decided to do it.  If we want to generate the model locally as part of the workspace build (we would have to if we delete the sources) then it should be integrated as a custom Eclipse project builder as in the Xtext/Xtend projects, not via maven.

Line:2, plugins/infra/pom.xml~ -> What is a pom.xml~ file?  If it's an emacs backup file, it doesn't belong in git.

Christian,
I have tried to answer the point you raised.
But I didn't take any decision for the m2e nature.
I hope that you could have a discussion with expert papyrus members.
I am on stand-by on this feature.
Line:23, plugins/infra/constraints/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints/.project -> Christian,
I do not understand exactly the impact of setting m2e nature. What I have seen, it is that some projects have xtend nature for instance: you need as a developer to preinstall the xtend eclipse plugin.
Moreover all the life cycle of papyrus is managed by a maven cycle. so perhaps it could be pertinent to match the developer environment with the continuous environment.

But I do not hold the cards.

To be discussed.

Line:2, plugins/infra/pom.xml~ -> sorry it is a centos/linux file
I will delete it.
