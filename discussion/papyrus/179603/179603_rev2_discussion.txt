DESCRIPTION:

Bug 572677: [Toolsmiths] Duplicate extensions for "Missing oepu.extensionpoints.UMLProfile" quickfix

- in the case of generating a new element, only add it to the plug-in
  model after configuring it
- fix up some method signatures for methods that access markers
  to let them throw CoreException
- add JUnit test coverage for affected quick fixes
- while we're at it, add all of the validation builder tests to the
  Toolsmiths test suite
- and fix the UML Profile validation build test failures

Patch Set 2:

Patch set 2 adds all of the Toolsmiths validation builder tests to the Toolsmiths suite that was already included in the build but didn't cover much. This is important to see that the new tests added by this patch run green.

And speaking of green ... I also include in this update a fix for the failing UML Profile validation builder tests because otherwise there'd be a failure in the tests added by this patch and it wouldn't compare favourably against the master tests baseline!
