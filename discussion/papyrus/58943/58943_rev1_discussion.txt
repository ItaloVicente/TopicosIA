I'm not convinced that this is the best way to fix duplicate constraint evaluation.  I think better may be to remove the other reason why constraints are evaluated and not change this validator adapter.
Line:66, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.service.validation/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/service/validation/OCLEValidatorAdapter.java -> Do we know that the core UML constraints will always be evaluated by some other mechanism?

Also, I don't like to see commented-out code.  It should just be deleted.  And then this clause of the "if" statement will be empty and should be deleted, which means that the next one (the "else" clause) should be changed to "else if eClass.eContainer() != getEPackage()".

And what if the package returned by getEPackage() isn't the UML metamodel?  Can this validator be used for other packages, which maybe shouldn't have their intrinsic constraints skipped in this way?

And what about constraints generated in profiles?  Are those also executed twice?  (their package is not the UML metamodel)
