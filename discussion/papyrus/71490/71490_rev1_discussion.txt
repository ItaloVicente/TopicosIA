DESCRIPTION:

Support viewpoint switch in Papyrus on per model level. This change is
in support of the following Bugzillas:

REQ_001	The user must be able to switch between viewpoint while editing
models with limited UI actions.
REQ_002	The user must be warned when opening a model in a different
viewpoint than the one it has been edited in and asked to switch to
appropriate viewpoint if needed
REQ_003	The situation where the required viewpoint to edit a model is
not available in the setup must be handled
REQ_004	The situation where multiple models are edited side by side but
edited through different viewpoints must be handled
REQ_005	It should be possible to ensure that a model will be created or
opened with the required viewpoint (more particularly in RCP)

The basic changes here include:
1- The viewpoint preferences page now allows enabling multiple viewpoint
configurations for the workspace.
2- The user is able to select and/or switch to a viewpoint that is
provided by one of the enabled configurations on a per model basis. The
viewpoint selection dialog can be invoked from the editor's main menu,
toolbar and context menu.
3- The ability to select the initial viewpoint for a model at the
creation wizard time (this is NOT implemented yet, to be done in an
upcoming delivery)
