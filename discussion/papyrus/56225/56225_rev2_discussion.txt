DESCRIPTION:

[CDO] Don't pop up a modal dialog in BasicEditorTest.isConflicting() that blocks test execution

The new interactive transaction conflict resolution functionality
involves a sequence of modal dialogs (including an EMF merge dialog)
that are too hard to test at this moment.

This patch reverts the editor behaviour to the the one that's expected 
by the test case when it was written.
