DESCRIPTION:

441227: [Properties view] Create New Property view tabs not working
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=441227

It is not currently feasible to apply stereotypes to elements that are new and not yet
attached to the model.  So, define a new properties-view constraint to test for the
selection being attached to a resource and constrain the SingleElement section of
the Profile tab accordingly.

The EditionDialog is updated to present only those tabs that have at least one
section applicable to the current object.

In testing, an NPE was encountered when a disposed Stereotype Applications
table responded to changes in the stereotypes applied to an element in the
dialog.  That is fixed by detecting the disposed widget and removing the callback.

Note that the Profile tab's SinglePackage section doesn't need to be hidden because applying a profile doesn't need the applying package to be in any resource.  I tested this by editing a PackageMerge relationship in the dialog and using the green + button to create a new Merged Package.

In the particular case of packages, which can have their own applied profiles, it might have made sense to let the applied stereotypes of a new package be edited (because they can be found in directly applied profiles), but I thought this might be a bit confusing.  Especially as it's rare enough to edit a package in the dialog (the only way I know how is by editing a PackageMerge or similar relationship) and a very high percentile of profile applications are on the root package of a model, anyways.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

The constrained sections are "Dynamic sections", i.e. sections which can be either hidden or displayed according to some constraint, which is reevaluated after each property change in the current view (without changing the current selection). This is typically used to display a section according to a specific property of the current element. For example, if the Layout of a Composite is GridLayout, then we display an additional section with the number of columns.

For completely hiding a section, it should be stored in a different View, and the constraint should be applied to the view. This would remove the need for checking for empty tabs (If the view is not displayed, the tab is never returned, and there is no need to dispose it afterwards)

Although this choice of constraining the section is the one which implies the minimal changes in the Properties view model, it doesn't really comply with the expected behavior of dynamic/constrained sections. I will make a few changes before validating this change
