Hi,

Good job in moving the handlers but I think they are part of API
(NEED A CONFIRMATION, I'm not sure of that)

If that the case, we cannot remove api in minor version change (1.0.x->1.1.0) (see https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#When_to_change_the_major_segment)

One solution will be to follow this refactoring pattern : 
 - mark the classes deprecated in 1.1.0
 - indicate the replacement
 - inherit from the newly created class

(I believe its a classic when it comes to moving up api in a framework)

I prefer wait the confirmation before to tag the old versions of handler to deprecated.

I agree with Benoit in the general cases for API definition, but handlers are not APIs. The commands are, but not the handlers. They are not meant to be used by clients, who should rely on the command and Eclipse framework.

Handlers are not (or shouldn't be) API. Still, if it possible to keep the old handler, make it extend the new one, and tag it as deprecated, this doesn't cost much and can avoid unnecessary trouble (Provided this doesn't introduce any undesired dependency, of course). In this case, this would introduce a dependency from uml.diagram.common to infra.gmfdiag.menu, but from what I see, this dependency already exists (I'm not sure that's a good thing however... I guess many things should be moved from uml.diagram.common to uml.diagram.menu, but we never completely finished this refactoring anyway)

Beside this dependency issue, I'm more concerned about the semantics part. There is certainly a lot in common between the Model Explorer deletion and the "Delete from Model" Diagram Deletion. Still, I only see changes in the GMFDiag plug-ins (Which includes some specific logic such as Control mode). Shouldn't the Service Edit be responsible for appending the Uncontrol commands to the Delete Command, when it receives a Delete Request? I think there was a discussion in this direction (To integrate the Control Mode with the Service Edit), but maybe it was on a slightly different issue. I still believe the approach should be the same.

So, a small -1 (because I may be completely off-topic or wrong here), but this should be verified or discussed
