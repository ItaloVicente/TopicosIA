DESCRIPTION:

Bug 465308: [Refactoring] A refactoring tool should be made available
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=465308
- the first tier of the tool seems to be working albeit with some minor issues (replace and cast) when used with diagrams representations, still needs qvto
- still needs to add the new cast and refactoring behaviors to the Papyrus' search page without the use of an extension point

Line:242, extraplugins/refactoring/org.eclipse.papyrus.refactoring/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/refactoring/core/PapyrusChange.java -> No, you can't execute a command on the stack that undoes a command.  In fact, this shouldn't be executing commands on the stack at all.  The LTK framework encapsulates all of the changes that it gets from participants and encapsulates them IUndoableOperations on the platform's history.  So, a Change should simply reference a command that it does and undoes in suitable transactions.  And I would recommend using an AbstractEMFOperation from GMF run-time instead of a RecordingCommand, both because its execute/undo/redo implementation takes care of creating the right kinds of transactions in any context and also because it might be easier to integrate changes in the diagrams this way (they often are ICommands).

So, I imagine that the refactoring Change would just have an AbstractEMFOperation on which it directly invokes execute, undo, or redo as appropriate to what kind of change it is supposed to be (as requested by LTK).
