DESCRIPTION:

Bug 468030: [Papyrus Core] Papyrus DI Model should support the notion of Language
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=468030

Implement a Language Service for configuration of the Papyrus ModelSet to
support custom implementations of UML and other modeling languages.

Includes:

* language service providing languages before the ModelSet loads any resources
* hooks for languages to configure and unconfigure a ModelSet
* implementation of a language provider that maps applied profiles to languages
* addition of a profile index service that provides the URIs of profiles applied
  to model resources without having to load them in a resource set
* a stub of a UML-RT language with placeholder for configuration of the ModelSet
* a standard UML language
* implementation of the profile index service using an enhanced DecoratorModelIndex
  that now also index the normal profile applications in user models

Papyrus Service Registry enhancements:

* support for optional service dependencies in the Papyrus Service Registry
  using a javax.inject dependency-injection container
* support for registration of POJO services
* fix the explicit starting of lazy services
* new ServiceUtilsForService API to get other services from the same registry
  as a known service instance

Looks good, but there is a little bit of magic which IMO should be avoided as much as possible, or at least clearly explained (in the code) so that we can debug it if anything goes wrong
Line:139, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/resource/ModelSet.java -> I'm not really fond of the magic of injectors. Can it be avoided? If not, the magic should really be commented

Line:25, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/utils/ServiceUtilsForService.java -> I'm not sure that we have any guarantee that a given service object will be used by a single ServicesRegistry.

While this is certainly true for extension-points, this may not be true for services registered manually. In practice I'm not sure we have any such case but I suppose it might happen
