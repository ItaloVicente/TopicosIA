DESCRIPTION:

Bug 468030: [Papyrus Core] Papyrus DI Model should support the notion of Language
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=468030

Implement a Language Service for configuration of the Papyrus ModelSet to
support custom implementations of UML and other modeling languages.

Includes:

* language service providing languages before the ModelSet loads any resources
* hooks for languages to configure and unconfigure a ModelSet
* implementation of a language provider that maps applied profiles to languages
* addition of a profile index service that provides the URIs of profiles applied
  to model resources without having to load them in a resource set
* a stub of a UML-RT language with placeholder for configuration of the ModelSet
* a standard UML language
* implementation of the profile index service using an enhanced DecoratorModelIndex
  that now also index the normal profile applications in user models

Papyrus Service Registry changes:

* fix the explicit starting of lazy services
* new AbstractServiceUtils API for requesting optional or defaultable services

Patch Set 2:

I have updated the patch to address code review comments:

* removed the explicit support for optional service dependencies from the
  service registry
* removed the service injection facility from the service registry
* removed support for registration of POJO services on the extension point
* removed the ServiceUtilsForService API

Dealing with the optional dependencies in the context of the model-set is now more
awkward as the problem has been pushed to its clients, which must know that the
model-set may be started early before the rest of the registry and that, therefore,
they may need to explicitly start services that they need.  But, the impact of
service registry changes is now smaller and less risky.

Maybe we can plan a global enhancement for the next release (Services Registry needs to be improved anyway), but I'm more comfortable with the current state for RC4.

Yeah, no kidding.  Sorry, I think I didn't actually have it in mind originally that the intent was to integrate this for the actual Mars release!
