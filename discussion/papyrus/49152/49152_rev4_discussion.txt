DESCRIPTION:

Bug 468030: [Papyrus Core] Papyrus DI Model should support the notion of Language
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=468030

Implement a Language Service for configuration of the Papyrus ModelSet to
support custom implementations of UML and other modeling languages.

Includes:

* language service providing languages before the ModelSet loads any resources
* hooks for languages to configure and unconfigure a ModelSet
* implementation of a language provider that maps applied profiles to languages
* addition of a profile index service that provides the URIs of profiles applied
  to model resources without having to load them in a resource set
* a stub of a UML-RT language with placeholder for configuration of the ModelSet
* a standard UML language
* implementation of the profile index service using an enhanced DecoratorModelIndex
  that now also index the normal profile applications in user models

Papyrus Service Registry changes:

* fix the explicit starting of lazy services
* new AbstractServiceUtils API for requesting optional or defaultable services

Also includes the very barest of JUnit tests covering:

* the new profile index service
* using the language service to query content-type-based languages
* UML languages:  UML models have the UML language, itself, and proper
  matching and installation of profile languages
