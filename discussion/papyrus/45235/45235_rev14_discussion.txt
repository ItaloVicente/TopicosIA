This change seems to interfere with drag-and-drop operations in diagrams that don't present signals and receptions (bug 464895).

Other comments in-line.
Line:8, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.dnd/build.properties -> The entire OSGI-INF/ folder should be included in bin.includes, not just the file that it contains (PDE adds a warning marker about this).

Line:32, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> There are two JARs in the lib/ folder.  Is this the correct one?

Line:7, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/build.properties -> Are the JARs in the lib/ folder third-party libraries?  If so, they need a CQ for IP review by the Eclipse Foundation before they can be released with Mars in June.

Line:8, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/build.properties -> The entire OSGI-INF/ folder should be included in bin.includes, not just the file that it contains (PDE adds a warning marker about this).

Line:22, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/plugin.xml -> This strategy is being invoked when I try to drop a message onto a lifeline in a sequence diagram (see bug 464895).

Line:113, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/dnd/signal2reception/SignalToReceptionDropStrategy.java -> Why use Java reflection?  EMF provides more robust model-based reflection.

Besides, we know we're trying to create Receptions for Signals in a Classifier that owns receptions, right?  There are easier ways to do this.

Line:131, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/dnd/signal2reception/SignalToReceptionDropStrategy.java -> Why not String.class to get the String class object?

Line:150, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/dnd/signal2reception/SignalToReceptionDropStrategy.java -> These should be logged in the workspace log, not printed to stderr.
Besides, they wouldn't happen with proper use of EMF reflection and guards to check whether the drop context is even appropriate for creating the objects we want to create.

I will look at it on monday.
It seems not to be critic.
Thanks for the remarks provided.
Hopefully the jar emmbeded is already in eclipse: org.eclipse.papyrus.tools.uml.graph

Okay, so it's not third-party code, but from the Papyrus project?  That's good; it won't block the release.  ;-)

But, then, why isn't that code in this plug-in or another Papyrus plug-in?  Why is it in a separate repository and installed as a JAR if it's required by a Papyrus plug-in?  As much as possible, the Papyrus distribution should be provided as OSGi bundles ...

I've reverted this change on master because it causes all of the diagram tests to hang on a pop-up menu asking whether to "Drop" or to "Change the default strategy -> Drop" (bug 465025).
