implementing "user controls".

Patch Set 1:

I did a quick test of the patch-set in the context of Papyrus-RT. And the performance is improved, toggling between a port and a capsule parts is now much more snappy.

There seem to be some major regression though, and none of the properties really shows any values, and especially the kind property (with the radio buttons) for both the port and capsule parts just states the text label "There is no value to select". 

Not sure if I am testing this in the wrong way though. I checked out the Gerrit change, and imported the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.properties.ui bunlde into the workspace (which was the only bundle that was changed from what I cans see), and simply started up a run-time instance based on the plugins in the workspace, which is the way that I usually test Papyrus changes.

Well, yes, this is a draft for informational purposes only to illustrate the line of attack that a work-around in Papyrus might take.  It is not much tested and I can't justify any investment of time to work out kinks in the data bindings (or whatever this problem is) unless and until we decide to follow through.  Although I personally prefer the other avenues I outlined in the bugzilla, especially the refactoring of the Papyrus properties-related APIs to minimize the XWT classpath which I think would be a good idea for performance in the long run anyways.
