I can't comment directly on the Gerrit files right now because Mylyn/Gerrit RC2 is broken, so here are a few comments:

- In TestStereotypeApplication, line 317: EditPart.refresh()

This should never be called directly. The EditPart is expected to be able to handle its own refresh when it needs it, by listening on the notation model. However, during the tests, such Refresh operations may be blocked by the fact the tests are running in the UI Thread (Thus blocking all UI events). To solve this, the tests (oep.junit.utils) provide a helper method: org.eclipse.papyrus.junit.utils.DisplayUtils.flushEventLoop(). Use this instead of EditPart#refresh(): if it doesn't work, then the EditPart probably doesn't correctly listen on its notation model (i.e. is actually broken)

- TestLayoutWithStereotype: Don't use @Ignore. Use conditional annotations instead (With proper comment to explain why the test needs to be disabled). E.g. InvalidTest, FailingTest, ...
- Line 177: There is a new "TODO" comment. Why?
- Line 253, Line 353, Line 606: EditPart#refresh -> DisplayUtils#flushEventLoop
