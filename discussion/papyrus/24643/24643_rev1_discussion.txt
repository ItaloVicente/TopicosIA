This single commit contains the full branch properties/ (Which had been built on Git before moving to Gerrit, and cannot be easily rebased)

It contains 4 features related to the Properties view

Patch Set 1: Verified-1 Code-Review+2

Code review: Code has been cleaned up and is OK. One previously failing test case is now green

Contribution: 

The plug-in oep.views.properties.table should be moved out of sandbox (To plugins/views/properties)

The DelayedObservable should be avoided on the Properties view generation wizard, in case of automatic-synchronization (Delay is only confusing in this case, although it makes sense when the user types some text directly)

(4 comments)

The properties view documentation should be in its own plug-in (oep.views.properties.doc), in the folder plugins/doc (And included in the feature oep.doc)

The ClassDiagram EditPartFactory should be restored (See comment in the source file)

The coloration framework still has some usability issues, which introduce confusion:

- Modify a field, with the exact same value (e.g. replace "Name" by "Name"). The field becomes orange (It should be white). Upon validating (e.g. focus lost), the field remains orange (The databinding is not applied, because the value is the same)

Nattable integration: More tests are required. 

- The multiplicity editor doesn't work for Class#ownedAttribute (Row = Property)
- The editor throws an exception each time the table is displayed in the properties view:

org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.services.ServiceNotFoundException: Can't find the ResourceSet needed retrieve the ServiceRegistry.
	at org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf.utils.ServiceUtilsForResource.getServiceRegistry(ServiceUtilsForResource.java:64)
	at org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf.utils.ServiceUtilsForEObject.getServiceRegistry(ServiceUtilsForEObject.java:43)
	at org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable.utils.TableEditingDomainUtils.getTableEditingDomain(TableEditingDomainUtils.java:49)
	at org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable.manager.table.NattableModelManager.<init>(NattableModelManager.java:249)

Management of transactions should be re-specified for the Tables (Since we've changed the Transaction framework, I think that having 2 editing domains is a bad idea and cannot really work). I take responsibility for this (bad) decision :) (I'll fix that when this contribution is merged)

The operation/property Table Configurations should be probably be moved to the uml.nattable plug-in (Vincent, can you confirm that they make sense outside the properties view framework? From what I remember, the configuration is dynamically changed, depending on the context + feature passed as a parameter. The properties view can do that, but I'm not sure this is supported with Tables as Editors)

Coloration framework: Minor issues to fix
Validation framework: OK, great!
Nattable integration: To be improved, but as an optional feature (disabled by default), this is ok to be merged
Properties view generation: OK, great! (Minor issue: avoid the DelayedObservable for automatic synchronization, see Comment 3). Ok to be merged

Overall: Some minor issues need to be fixed before this contribution can be merged. A few major issues remain but they should be easily fixed

Also see in-file comments
Line:83, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/handler/AbstractTableHandler.java -> try/catch(Exception) should be avoided. If they are necessary, they should always be commented (Empty catch blocks must be commented)

Line:252, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/manager/table/NattableModelManager.java -> To explain: What kind of exception is expected here? If there is a specific expected case, it must be commented. If we don't know what might happen, then the exception should be logged

Hi Thibault, thank you for your contribution, your work is very interesting. Unfortunately, I can't accept this code, you should clean it. 
1. You must remove or comments your //TODO and //FIXME
2. The main part of your classes in oep.views.properties.table must be moved into org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.nattable
3. Your uml table configuration should be into oep.uml.nattable.generic.config
5. Your derived axis manager should provide a IRestrictedContentProvider for the integration into Papyrus Nattable
6. ResizeAllRow/ColumnHandler should be in oep.infra.nattable
7. Remove or comment your try/catch block
8. Don't hesitate to comment your code
