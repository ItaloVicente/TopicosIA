Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

This changeset contains changes to 3 files, 2 of them are non-functional changes unrelated to the issue at hand:
- Changes in PapyrusPaletteService.java
- Changes in XMLPaletteApplicator.java
While the changes in these two files are of interest for another reason I would recommend to submit them in another patch for the the support of i18n (or lack of in this case).

Beware that FilteringPaletteProvider used to only proxy palettes providers of type DefaultPaletteProvider, and not the generic IPaletteProvider because it was not guaranteed to work on all GMF IPaletteProvider. This is important because the FilteringPaletteProvider is part of the public API (per Papyrus policy of having all publicly exposed component as part of the public API). This could induce false expectations from the user, especially if a custom user-defined provider does not support the way it is proxied.
Indeed, the FilteringPaletteProvider have a peculiar way of using the proxied palette provider by resetting its contributions repeatedly (on line 260). This works for the DefaultPaletteProvider because we know the inner workings of this class, but this is not guaranteed to work on all IPaletteProvider. Note that relying on the knowledge of the inner workings of DefaultPaletteProvider is not a nice pattern ...

Other mprovement track: Now that WalkerPaletteContributionHelper (in FilteringPaletteProvider.java) has non-static methods and uses instance fields, we could optimize its member (private) methods so that they do not instantiate a bunch of lists for nothing but all contribute to the same. We can do that by passing the resulting list as a parameter, or as an instance field.

Side note regarding style: there are some trailing whitespaces in the contributed changes in FilteringPaletteProvider.java

About cleaning (//$NON-NLS-1) I don't think that there is any  official Papyrus recommendation for this sort of improvement. 
(continuously vs standalone commit)

About FilteringPaletteProvider, it should work on any IPaletteprovider. For example it should also work recursively and on ExtendedpluginPaletteProvider (new recommended way of palette customization)
=> Is there any know use case where this doesn't work ? 


About WalkerPaletteContributionHelper  : I think there will be another feature for this. We are reading the file for each palette, although it could be read only the first time.
