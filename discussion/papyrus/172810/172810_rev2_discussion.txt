Christian, thanks for your detailed review, much appreciated! 

I addressed all comments, except one on the log (https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/papyrus/org.eclipse.papyrus/+/172810/1/plugins/toolsmiths/validation/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.validation.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/toolsmiths/validation/profile/internal/checkers/ProfileDependenciesChecker.java#188) 
I also tried to address the copyright issue with the clone class from PDE, I wasn't sure of the best approach to keep historic copyright.

Finally, I fixed 2 issues:
- we now also check (with a warning level if in failure) that ecore and genmodel files are included in the binary build (feedback from committers)
- the ecore generated package had an issue with subprofiles, the check should now work if one of the profile or subprofiles has no ecore package declared.

Looks great! Thanks.
Line:63, plugins/toolsmiths/builder/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.plugin.builder/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/toolsmiths/plugin/builder/AbstractPapyrusBuilder.java -> Oh, sorry, I was meaning actually documented in the Javadoc for those that use it, but this will do, also.

Line:108, plugins/toolsmiths/validation/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.validation.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/toolsmiths/validation/profile/internal/checkers/ProfileBuildChecker.java -> Yes, good additions. I should have seen that in my review.
