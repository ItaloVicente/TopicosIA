DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575819: [Performance] Models leaks in validation and handlers

- fix model leak in enablement calculation of command handlers
- fix model leak in the share EValidator registry instance

The latter is implemented as a new validation hook that cleans up registry
changes applied by the Pivot OCL validator. This requires enhancements to
the hook extension point:

- add ordering capability, to ensure that the registry state can be captured
  before the Sequence Diagram's hook injects OCL documents into validation
- support stateful validation hooks, which is required for the new hook to
  capture a clean validator registry state and restore it after validation

Patch Set 2:

I am unable to reproduce the memory-leak test failures in maven builds in a Linux VM on my local system, neither in the development environment. So I'm a bit baffled as to why they fail in these Gerrit builds.

I am more concerned about the regression in the Sequence Diagram tests, as the failing test that in that suite uses the OCL constraints injected via a validation hook, which is a component that this patch changes in no small degree.

In fact, I can reproduce this regression in my test environment.

Patch Set 2:

The leak in the model validation is actually something that should better be fixed in the OCL Pivot run-time. It registers dynamic packages from UML profiles in the static EMF EPackage.Registry.INSTANCE, which it probably should not do, or at least should ensure that it removes the registration again.
