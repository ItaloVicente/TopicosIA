DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575205: [Core, model indexer] Race condition workspace model indexer

- do not use JobManager::join to wait for idle state of indexing
- aggregate after-index computations onto a single job to avoid
  flooding the JobManager with tiny JobBasedFutures

Patch Set 2:

Patch set 2 makes a change that I think is important to apply regardless what else we find in this investigation, which is to collect all "after-index" computations into a single job. Without this change, the JobManager can be flooded with a large number of concurrent tiny jobs all waiting for the indexing to finish before running a single computation. This then leaves a large number of Java threads for the JobManager to clean up over time.

So, this change is at least very good for reining in the burden on the JobManager.

However, with and without this change, I've been running the UML Test Suite all afternoon in a Linux VM and not seen them lock up once. So, I'm not satisfied that this fixes whatever race condition is causing that and the job will not be complete. But perhaps we should merge this anyways in the interim as it can only help debugging not have dozens upon dozens of JobManager worker threads standing idle while the tests run.

I am able to reproduce the new test failure locally in a maven build (not so much in the Eclipse dev environment). I need to look into that. Seems to be another race condition that doesn't deadlock but doesn't wait as it should?
