Patch Set 1:

In the original implementation, I think I used the JobManager::join(...) API because the "afterIndex" operation needs to wait any pending indexing operations to finish, and these are managed by the JobWrangler job which finishes when they do. So, logically, this join will ensure that everything has finished before the "afterIndex" operation proceeds and releases the calling thread.

However, this is not sufficiently specific and (as we have seen) is subject to deadlock due to unanticipated interactions with jobs, especially as the join is itself done in a job. More specific is to await the condition of the JobWrangler having finished its work, independently of any Eclipse jobs semantics, which is how this patch now implements the wait.

I have run the maven test build a few times in a Linux virtual machine and not found either the Infra Tests suite or the UML Tests suite to hang on the deadlock. I am not sure that this is sufficient to convince ourselves that the deadlock is fixed, so I'd appreciate it if the original reporter of the problem could double-check with the scenario that was able to reproduce the deadlock fairly reliably.

Unfortunately, I can still reproduce the timeout exception (and a non-terminating test) - maybe less frequent than before (2 out of 5 runs).
