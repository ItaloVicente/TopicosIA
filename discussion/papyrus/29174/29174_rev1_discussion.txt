Two general comments.

First, what relationship (if any) does/should the StereotypeElementListener class have with PapyrusStereotypeListener (which is a different kind of listener, a multiplexed IPapyrusListener)?  At a glance, they seem to be serving the same purpose (mind, I didn't give PapyrusStereotypeListener a careful reading).

Second, this listener is triggering on the wrong kind of notification.  Every stereotype instance added to any resource in the resource set will trigger a notification that the UML element has had a stereotype applied to it.  Likewise every stereotype instance removed from any resource in the resource set will trigger a stereotype-removed notification.  The listener needs to trigger on Elements being set/unset in the base_Xyz references of the stereotype application.  Moreover, doing it this way, a single instance of the listener attached to the resource set will be able to fire stereotype notifications on all UML elements, not just one for which the listener was created.  Also, it doesn't need to listen to the entire contents of the ResourceSet.  This adapter only needs to listen to EObjects that are stereotype instances, and those will only be located in Resource::contents lists.
Line:33, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> ECrossReferenceAdapter already implements Adapter, so the interface is redundant.

But more importantly, this adapter will be yet another adapter added to every object in the resource set.  Did you consider whether it would work as an IPapyrusListener, instead, or even a ResourceSetListener?  Both have the advantage of being multiplexed by an adapter that is already attached to the resource set, reducing model bloat.  Also, the ResourceSetListener sends out notifications as a batch after a transaction has committed, which can be useful for analyzing a group of related changes but can also be a hindrance.

Line:36, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> How do we ensure that these codes don't conflict with other applications?  Is EMF's Notification::type enumeration even extensible/customizable?  I'm not sure that injecting custom Notifications is a good idea ... a dedicated listener interface might be more appropriate.

Line:52, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> If this is to be an ECrossReferenceAdapter, I would prefer that (a) it just be attached to the element's adapter list and allowed to propagate itself to the reachable model scope as an ECrossReferenceAdapter does, and (b) that it check first whether it isn't already attached to the element to prevent redundant attachment (the eAdapters list does not enforce uniqueness)

Line:62, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> Shouldn't we be checking somewhere that the UML element in question is the one that the base_Xyz reference does or did reference?

Line:66, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> What about ADD_MANY and REMOVE_MANY?

Line:68, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> This method assumes a bit too much about what changes indicate stereotype application/unapplication.  If some EObject is added to any reference feature (containment, cross-reference, or even the Resource::contents pseudo-feature) and if that EObject has a feature (reference or attribute!) named base_Xyz, then it is assumed to be a stereotype application that has been added.

So, if I set a reference property of stereotype instance to refer to an instance of some other stereotype, then this will be detected as a stereotype applied to an element.  But, then we'll get a ClassCastException on attempting to cast the referencing stereotype instance as an ElementImpl.

Line:70, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> Don't cast to ElementImpl.  In general, the XyzImpl classes of an EMF model are not API and there's almost never a valid reason to use them.

Line:90, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> Also, a method named isXyz() should have a boolean return result.  This should be named getBaseElementFeature.

Line:90, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> Indeed. If there is a UMLUtil API that is equivalent, we should reuse it.  Or, if we have additional/different needs in this listener, UMLUtil may still serve part of that need.

Line:97, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> Two problems:  only EReferences whose type conforms to UML::Element can be extension ends, regardless of the name (an unfortunate profile might have EAttributes or non-element references named base_Xyz, although users really should be warned against that).  And there can be multiple metaclass extension references:  which one should be returned? (I suppose in this particular usage it matters only that there is some metaclass extension)

Line:55, tests/junit/plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/tests/tests/StereotypeElementListenerTest.java -> Nice to see some test cases, especially for undo/redo scenarios.
Might also tests for edge cases, such as ensuring that the listener does not mistake stereotype associations as metaclass extensions.

Line:108, tests/junit/plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/tests/tests/StereotypeElementListenerTest.java -> Shouldn't we also assert that the correct UML Element sent the notification?  Similar comment in other tests.

Line:124, tests/junit/plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/tests/tests/StereotypeElementListenerTest.java -> Profile::getOwnedStereotype(String) simplifies this and is more expressive of the intent :-)

That's true that PapyrusStereotypeListener serves the same purpose but it doesn't
fire event on undo action. The new adapter must resolve this. Many Papyrus 
parts use PapyrusStereotypeListener events and it's hard to delete it but maybe 
replace it later.

Line:33, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> I tried to use ResourceSetListener but it didn't correspond to my need. The IPapyrusListener can be interesting for multiplexing different cross reference adapter like is already done for content adapter on a model (ModelListenerManager).

Line:36, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> I looked for a best solution but I didn't find how ensure that theses event types won't be in conflict with other. I will follow your advice and I will create a dedicated interface.

Line:52, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> (a) How can it allow to propagate to the reachable model scope ? I tried to attach directly to element adapters list but there were not no notification for stereotype application.
(b) OK

Line:62, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> Yes to ensure to treat only the element modifications.

Line:66, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> To treat in next patch.

Line:70, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> I will use InternalEObject instead of casting to ElementImpl.

Line:97, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> I will consider this case by creating an associated test. I didn't think that there could be multiple extensions references.

Line:108, tests/junit/plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/tests/tests/StereotypeElementListenerTest.java -> Indeed, it can be interesting to verify the notifier. I will add an assertion method to inner class to do this.
