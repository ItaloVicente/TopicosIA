Hi, Gabriel,

Since you've been doing so much work on my instigation, I thought I should contribute a bit of effort, myself.  :-)

Patch set 6 has a few changes that I hope should clear things up:

  - redraft the testFakeBaseProperty according to the use case that I had suggested
     in an earlier comment
  - the checking whether the notifying property is an end of an extension needed to
     account for the possibility that the Ecore definition's name was mangled to make
     it a valid Java identifier (it could be different from the UML name).  So, I changed
     the matcher to use a different UML API
  - something I should have noticed earlier, but didn't, was that the notification from
     the perspective of the base UML element presented a property of the stereotype
     application, which doesn't make sense, because that's not a property of the UML
     element.  I've changed the notification to make it better aligned with the UML
     semantics:  the old/new value is now the stereotype that was unapplied/applied
     and there is no feature because the UML element doesn't really have a metaclass
     extension end
  - none of the tests previously asserted the details of the notification (they all
     passed after I changed what the notification carries).  I've added some assertions
     for the notification old/new values
     
Let me know what you think of these changes.

It looks good for me. The listener take a real sense and tests are well initialised for maintaining. I just made one minor remark, see comments.
Line:104, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> This modification of setting the stereotype in custom notification adds real sense for this listener.

Line:133, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> I like the way that you simplify this Finder (before Matcher). But why doesn't use it everywhere instead UMLUtil  ?

Line:133, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> I don't think I understand the question about usage of UMLUtil.  All of the UMLUtil API methods are static, so they should be invoked via the class that declares them (which is UMLUtil).  The StereotypeExtensionFinder class only extends UMLUtil to access its protected API (ugh).  Did I misunderstand the question?

Line:133, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/listeners/StereotypeElementListener.java -> My question was malformed. In fact, I asked if the other uses of UMLUtil in StereotypeElementListener could be replaced by your own implementation (StereotypeExtensionFinder) like use at lines 85,86,... 

Your own implementation of UMLUtil didn't need an explanation to understand it.

I haven't looked too much into the details; I focused on the tested use cases. Looks good so far. A few test cases on separate resources (Library, control mode?) would be useful.

Christian, if you think that the contribution is ready, please feel free to push it (I'm not sure whether you are still planing some improvements)

Those additional test cases would be verifying that stereotype applications are detected and manipulated correctly when in libraries, controlled resources, etc.  That's the job of the UML2 API and so out of scope of this enhancement, I think.
