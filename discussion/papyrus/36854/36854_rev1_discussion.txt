The proposed fix seems really specific to DataType and Class. Would it make sense to have something generic such as StructuredClassifier instead?

Probably, but we don't have any document listing what was allowed in Kepler (and no more in luna).

This migration is a bit specific, since we have to add an owning rules in the default viewpoint. The default viewpoint is restrictive for the ownership.

Do we want to keep that? Or change to allow all sort of classifier ? 

=> I personally will prefer to open everything, especially for classifier (Ref to the "Neighborhood Diagrams" concept, having the default class diagram created in a class with nearestpackage as root. See Bug 439872)
