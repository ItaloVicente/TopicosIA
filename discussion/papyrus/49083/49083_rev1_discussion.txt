Line:1, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.activity/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/activity/edit/parts/CallOperationActionEditPart.java -> Do you know why the whole file is marked as removed/added? 
We are going to regenerate diagrams before RC3, and I would like to avoid the big diffs, and especially the formatting war. 

But actually I don't understand why it is shown as +800/-800 lines. The line breaks which are common cause for diffs like this has not actually changed, and I don't know any other possible reasons. 

Compare, e.g with similar regeneration change here: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/47913/5/plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.activity/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/activity/edit/parts/CallBehaviorActionEditPart.java

Actually, I have switched gerrit from side-by-side to diff mode and it clearly shows that it comes from incorrect switching to windows line breaks.

Line:1, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.activity/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/activity/edit/parts/CallOperationActionEditPart.java -> I don't know exactly, I tried everythings to avoid whitespace. I suspect an encoding issue. I generate with papyrus formatter in UTF8 but there is still the line break (certainly from xtend template). What formatter do you use ? How can I contribute to activity.gmfgen without disturb you in your work? I have also the modification of bug 465582 to add in activity.gmfgen.

I think specifically for this gerrit, just selecting of the affected files in Project Explorer and firing File / Convert Line Delimiters To / Unix should help. 

More generally some magic around "git config core.autocrlf true" should work on Win, but I guess you will need to delete and re-checkout the whole repository after changing this

And activity.gmfgen changes looks perfect for me. There may be some general issues in merging the gmfgen files, but we already use to deal with them and this patch only affects lines that must be changed, 

So please don't hesitate with your further changes (provided that the line breaks remains native for git :) )
