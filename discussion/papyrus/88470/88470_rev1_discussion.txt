DESCRIPTION:

Bug 510254: [Infra] Label provider changes should be propagated in Display thread

Ensure that the various bits of the Properties View are notified of label
updates on the UI thread because (a) observables can only interact on the UI thread
and (b) the Eclipse Properties View framework doesn't account for title label
provider updates triggered on any other thread.

Patch Set 1:

Because so many clients of the label-provider service do correctly handle background thread updates, I am not keen on making the ExtensibleLabelProvider synchronize with the UI thread.

So, the two specific cases identified so far in the Properties View are addressed in this patch.  Firstly, in the label-provider supplied by the DataSource, which can reasonably anticipate that label updates will trigger interactions with observables, and secondly in the label-provider for the Properties View title to work around the Eclipse Properties View framework's unpreparedness for background updates.

I have tested the change on my simple and complex use cases and both of them have improved significantly, so thanks for your work!

One note, I have observed an additional place that results in Illegal Thread Access but it seems that it is already fixed in master but not on 2.0-maintenance:

In [1] there is no thread check in UMLDiagramEditor.configureDiagramEditDomain(), while in [2] there is. I suppose the update in the generator that changed this behavior exists only on master.

Thanks for your help, Abel!  I appreciate it.

Yeah, I'm wary of making changes to the code generator in the maintenance branch.  Somebody with more experience in that code than I should perhaps think about that.  ;-)
