It think it would be better to have different RCPs for Papyrus, Papyrus/Extra and Papyrus/Developers

I don't really like the idea of replacing the current RCP configuration with a "Full Papyrus" distribution. However, I'm not sure whether papyrus.rcp was supposed to be an example (In which case that's fine) or a product (In which case we need to define a different one for developers tools.

The aim of releng/rcp/org.eclipse.papyrus.rcp/ was to provide an "End-user"-RCP. This RCP was provided as an example. We don’t provide any official RCP yet. 
I agree that there must be a different developers-RCP. Extra plugins shouldn’t be part of the “End-user”-RCP because we don’t provide full support for them.
