DESCRIPTION:

441857: [Performances - Model Explorer] Severe performance problems for larger models
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=441857

Don't refresh the entire model explorer every time the selection in a
diagram editor changes. Moreover, let requests for synchronous refresh
merely hurry up a pending asynchronous refresh (if any). This works on
the assumption that only changes in the resource set and/or read-only
state should invalidate the explorer's presentation, which is supported
by the fact that only these triggers schedule an asynchronous refresh
in the first place.

Patch Set 2:

Patch set 2 changes things up to improve the general case of select-reveal.

The basic premise is that we want to ensure, before attempting to select and reveal an element, that the tree structure is up-to-date.  To that end, we don't force a refresh but simply hurry up a pending async refresh, if there happens to be one.  The reasoning is that a wholescale refresh is only needed when the resource set changes or the read-only state of some resource changes, which events currently trigger async refresh (note that other use cases such as changing enabled facet customizations or common navigator content are handled separately by the facet and navigator frameworks, respectively).

Testing link-with-editor and marker navigation from the Model Validation view under the profiler, I see that calculation of the tree structure (especially in the EMF Facet content provider) is not a performance hotspot and my large-ish model is quite responsive.  Refresh on model edits, loading additional resources for model library imports, and making library resources writable all seem to work.

Looks good (There's just a minor comment inline regarding the NPE-check)
Line:796, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/ModelExplorerView.java -> It looks like a NPE-check on display is missing here (NPE-safety seemed to be the point of the initial null-check of control)
