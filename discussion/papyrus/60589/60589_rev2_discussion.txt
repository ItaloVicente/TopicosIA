One minor comment regarding the code style (See inline)

I'm surprised that UML doesn't automatically overrides the profile when it is reapplied. Calling applyProfile() twice should replace the first application with the second. Unless you are using different versions of the same profile? (Which would probably indicate a bug)

I don't think comparing profile URIs should be required
Line:481, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.wizards/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/wizards/wizards/CreateModelWizard.java -> Unless an Iterator is explicitly required (e.g. to use iterator.remove()), for: loops are more concise and easier to read

Actualy, as the wizard allows the user to choose another profile application from the registered ones the profile applied is fetched and a new instance of it is created (to be applied). However, on PackageOperation, the getProfileApplication(Package, Profile) checks the application with an == and since those two instances do not share the same pointer the are considered not equal and therefore ApplyProfileCommand's applyProfile(Package, Profile) considers that there were no pre-existing profiles of this type and proceeds to apply it again.

So if I understand correctly, this means that the same profile is loaded twice, in two different resource sets? Loading models in different resource sets is probably the error. The wizard should manipulate a single resource set (or Model set)
