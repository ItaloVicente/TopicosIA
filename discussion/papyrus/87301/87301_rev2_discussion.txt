DESCRIPTION:

Bug 509338 - [Model Import] Do not force port shape with automatic
layout to be located on the top left corner of the class in a composite
structure diagram

* do not transform (create a port shape in the notation model) for semi
automatic ports (ports with layout constraint bounds unset)

The oclIsUndefined() operation returns true only for the null value.  In EMF, primitive-valued attributes can never be null:  Java primitives are value types.

But eIsSet() is only really accurate for features that declare themselves in the Ecore model as "unsettable".  This means that, in addition to the value, the feature has an explicit set/unset state.  The x/y location features in the notation model are not unsettable, so there is no way to distinguish between a zero value that was set explicitly and one that was just never set to something non-zero.

But, RSA would have the same problem of eIsSet having no meaning, so if RSA interprets (0, 0) as an unset location, then so must we.

Aha, so just for my own understanding and learning new things, what is it that makes the x and y values not to be persistently stored in the model file? If these features are not "unsettable", what is it that controls what gets persisted (I had always thought that it in fact was that it was "unset" that made the value to not be persistently stored)? Is it that they have their default values? And where is the default value specified? I guess it then has to be specified in the Ecore model, so that that it is know what to store persistently or not? 

But if that is the case, then as you say, there is no way of knowing whether (0, 0) is actually unset, or explicitly set, and (0, 0) must then be interpreted as something that always should have auto-layout (exactly as Asma originally had it).

Exactly.  For a feature that is not unsettable, EMF run-time considers it as unset if it its value is the default.  The default x and y of a Location in the notation model are both zero, so you would never expect actually to see x="0" or y="0" in the XML.

Yes.  Every EAttribute in the ECore model specifies a default value (even if it's just the default-default, which for integer values is 0).  EReferences can't specify default values.

Considering the latest discussion here regaring "unsettable" features, should we then revert the solution to how it looked like in patch set 1, i.e. simply checking if the value is 0, and not use the eIsSet?

Yes, I think that we should keep the test that compare the values of x and y to 0. 
As explained by Christian, eIsSet was working because it does exactly the same of if (x=0) for x feature: looking if the value is equal to the default value or not. 
If x and y are not unseattable, I prefer to compare the value to 0 rather that using eIsSet which is more accurate for unsettable features (as explained by Christian) 

thank you Christian for the explanation and for the review :)
