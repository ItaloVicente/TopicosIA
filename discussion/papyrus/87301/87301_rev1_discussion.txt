DESCRIPTION:

Bug 509338 - [Model Import] Do not force port shape with automatic
layout to be located on the top left corner of the class in a composite
structure diagram

* do not transform (create a port shape in the notation model) for semi
automatic ports (ports with layout constraint bounds x=y=0)

Line:887, extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa/transform/RSAStructureDiagram.qvto -> Looks like a spelling error, I assume it should be isSemiAutomatic() without the 'r'.

Line:889, extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa/transform/RSAStructureDiagram.qvto -> Will this work as intended for all cases? What if the shape actually have an *explicit* position of x=y=0? Then we don't want such a shape to get an automatic position. I would have assumed that the check should be made whether the bounds are *unset* in the notation model. I don't know anything about if and how this can be achieved in QVTo. On Ecore level I would have assumed some check like eIsSet().

the problem is that the x and y are explicitly set to 0 even for semi automatic ports. to verify it open the *.emx file in UML editor and you will finc that x=y=0 for the semi automatic port I debug the transformation and the x and y for semi automatic ports are explicitly set to 0.

The problem is that when opening in the UML editor, you really don't see that a property is explicitly set or having its default, unset, value. You need to check the model file in a text editor.

Here you have what is persistently stored for shape for p2Short

            <children xmi:type="umlnotation:UMLShape" xmi:id="_HzMvhbY8Eeaqj4m-jiEQ4Q" element="_CXZ1MLY8Eeaqj4m-jiEQ4Q" fontName="Sans" fontHeight="8" showListVisibility="None" showListSignature="true" fillColor="16116705" transparency="0" lineColor="14263149" lineWidth="1" showStereotype="Label">
              <eAnnotations xmi:id="_HzNWkLY8Eeaqj4m-jiEQ4Q" source="com.ibm.xtools.uml.ui.diagram.internal.styles">
                <details xmi:id="_HzNWkbY8Eeaqj4m-jiEQ4Q" key="ShowTypeLabelStyle" value="Represents Name and Type Name"/>
              </eAnnotations>
              <children xmi:type="notation:DecorationNode" xmi:id="_HzNWkrY8Eeaqj4m-jiEQ4Q" type="PortName">
                <children xmi:type="notation:BasicDecorationNode" xmi:id="_HzNWlLY8Eeaqj4m-jiEQ4Q" type="PartTextCompartment"/>
                <layoutConstraint xmi:type="notation:Bounds" xmi:id="_HzNWk7Y8Eeaqj4m-jiEQ4Q" y="-170"/>
              </children>
              <layoutConstraint xmi:type="notation:Bounds" xmi:id="_HzMvhrY8Eeaqj4m-jiEQ4Q"/>
            </children>

As you cans see the layoutConstraint does not have x and y properties explicitly set. The UML editor then show them as their default values.

That was why I said that the check should be made with something similar to eIsSet() on Ecore level.

OK, I will verify this in the QVto Transformation, I checked with oclIsUndefined() method but it does not work, for Qvto, the locastion.x and the location.y are well defined. But since the GMF Notation is an EMF metamodel, we can apply the eIsSet() method, we need just to cast the Location to EObject, I will let you know.

OK it works with eIsSet method. so oclIsUndefined() looks maybe at the default value and that's why it return false for x and y not set in the notation model. May be Christian could give a more detailed explanation on oclIsUndefined() I remembrer that when I start working on Eclipse with OCL in 2007 it was Christian who answered my questions on the ocl forum :) :) :)

Line:887, extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa/transform/RSAStructureDiagram.qvto -> Done

Line:889, extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa/transform/RSAStructureDiagram.qvto -> Done although the case with explicitly setting the x and the y bounds to 0 in RSA is not possible unless we set it by hand while opening the *.emx file in text reader. 

In fact the x=y=0 in RSA did not correspond to the top left corner of the Class, RSA uses himetric unit and a different layout constraint than Papyurs. so I think that we are not likely to get this particular case of x=y=0 from a leagacy model,but Peter can again correct me and see if he has already seen such case.

Line:889, extraplugins/migration/org.eclipse.papyrus.migration.rsa/transform/RSAStructureDiagram.qvto -> I can't claim that I have ever seen x=y=0. I don't tend to study the notation models in that much detail, and my insight into how things work regarding the notation model is pretty limited. If you say that this use of "himetric unit" (which I personally have no idea what it is) in practice means that x=y=0 never will happen, then I can only trust you that, that is the case. I just made this comment based on this specific aspect of differentiating between a set vs. an unset value (which is an ever recurring issue in some several other situations, e.g. with respect to visibility in UML), where it far too often is not considered between a value explicitly set to its default value vs. the case when the value is unset (and not stored persistently).

Yes, Thanks for the review :) Hope that chrsitan will have time to look at this gerrit conversation and give his point of view
