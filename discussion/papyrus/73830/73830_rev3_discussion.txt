DESCRIPTION:

Bug 436665: [CSS] Refresh issue when an element is moved to a different owner
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=436665

Ensure that the element-adapter containment is refreshed whenever
notation view containment changes.

As a related (similar) problem, also fix stale CSS Engines without
parent engine (or other important state) remaining on some notation
views that had initialized their CSS support during creation of a
diagram, before it was attached to the resource (therefore not having
the Model Engine).  The root diagram would replace its engine on
attachment to the resource, but not its contained views.
