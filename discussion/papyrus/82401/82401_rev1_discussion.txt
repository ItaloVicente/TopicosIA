This patch causes NPEs on all platforms except Windows, where the device of an IPath is not null.

Besides this, the entirety of the loadData method is work-arounds for the bogus URI passed into the export dialog by the ExportAllDiagramsAction in the first place, which is what actually should be fixed.  Then all of the massaging of the output directory URI in the loadData method can just be deleted.
Line:176, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.export/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/export/actions/ExportComposite.java -> Which is it?  getFolder or findMember?  We don't need both, and here the result of getMember is replacing the result of getFolder.

Besides that the real problem is that the 'uriDiagramFile' at this point is garbage:  we are going through this rigmarole to fix a URI that is the filesystem location of a resource with 'platform:/resource/' blindly prepended on it.  What we really need to fix is the ExportAllDiagramsAction::execute(...) method, which incorrectly uses the URI::createPlatformResourceURI(...) API on the filesystem location of the container resource of the selected model.

Line:180, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.export/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/export/actions/ExportComposite.java -> Get device is not relevant in some filesystems.  Why is this necessary?  Even on Windows, the workspace can have projects stored in D: and E: drives even if the workspace folder is itself on C: drive, for example.

In fact, on non-Windows platforms, this line will NPE on the null device of the location (as I observed in testing this patch on Mac).

Line:190, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.export/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/export/actions/ExportComposite.java -> This is a backslash on Windows platform, which doesn't belong in a platform:/resource URI.  And none of this would be necessary if we just used a proper platform:/resource URI in the first place, as discussed above.
