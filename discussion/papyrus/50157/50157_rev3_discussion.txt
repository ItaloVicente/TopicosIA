Added Christian to the review, as I am not able by myself to judge the quality of the contribution (dealing with Canonical Policies)

Which bugzilla does this change fix?  I see no reference, neither in the commit comment nor in the source files.

This change needs one or more JUnit regression tests.
Line:563, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.canonical/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/canonical/editpolicy/PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy.java -> GMF has no such method.

Line:603, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.canonical/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/canonical/editpolicy/PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy.java -> I don't understand the purpose of this method.  Does it create views that have no semantic connections?  Or does it create views for connections that have no semantic element?  If the latter, when/where do we create connections that do have semantic elements?

The "no semantic" naming is, generally speaking, confusing.

Line:628, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.canonical/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/canonical/editpolicy/PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy.java -> I would prefer "createReferenceConnectionView" or something else than the "no semantic" terminology, which leads to confusing names.  Connections that don't have semantic elements usually (in canonical context, always) represent reference features of the source end.

Line:662, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.canonical/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/canonical/editpolicy/PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy.java -> This should be named "isReferenceConnectorOrphaned".  Where did it come from?

Line:671, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.canonical/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/canonical/editpolicy/PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy.java -> This should be named "createReferenceConnector".  Where did it come from?

Line:41, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.canonical/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/canonical/internal/provider/PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicyProvider.java -> The canonical form of the boolean expression is
" !(curCanonicalPolicy instanceof PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy) "

And you don't need the null test because null is not an instance of PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy.

File Comment: plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.common/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/common/utils/EditPartFindUtil.java -> This would seem to overlap with the purpose of the utilities in the DiagramEditPartsUtil class.  Perhaps if there isn't an API already in that class providing these capabilities, these methods should be moved to DiagramEditPartsUtil.

Otherwise, this file needs a copyright header.
Line:91, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.clazz/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Missing the dependency version range.  Running the JUnit tests would show that.

File Comment: plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.clazz/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/clazz/custom/policies/NoSemanticPapyrusCanonicalPolicy.java -> Missing the copyright header.
Line:84, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.clazz/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/clazz/edit/parts/ConstraintEditPart.java -> This will be obliterated by the next regeneration of the diagram.
The custom edit policy needs to be added to the GMFGen.

File Comment: plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.profile/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/profile/custom/policies/NoSemanticPapyrusCanonicalPolicy.java -> Missing the copyright header.
Line:85, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.profile/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/profile/edit/parts/ConstraintEditPart.java -> This will be obliterated by the next regeneration of the diagram.
The custom edit policy needs to be added to the GMFGen.
