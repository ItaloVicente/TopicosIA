DESCRIPTION:

Merge branch 'bugs/570486-ad-merge-inherit' into bugs/568494-toolsmiths-dev

Bug 570486: [Architecture] Architecture model shall clearly define merge and inherit concepts

Updates to the Architecture Description model.

Changes:

- make ArchitectureContext::creationCommandClass optional ([0..1]
  multiplicity) as it is now not required by a context that extends
  another context

Additions in class ArchitectureContext:

- reference extendedContexts: ArchitectureContext [*] — the contexts
  to which this context contributes elements such as viewpoints
- reference generalContext: ArchitectureContext [0..1] — a context
  that this context specializes to define a new instantiable context
  based on it
- attribute /extension: Boolean — whether the context is an extension
  of one or more other contexts. An extension context cannot be
  instantiated in it own right and does not appear in the New Model
  Wizard and other UIs that present architecture contexts
- operation isConsistentWith(context: ArchitectureContext): Boolean —
  query whether this context is consistent with another one with
  respect to extension or generalization. For now the only condition
  is that they are of the same class (an ArchitectureFramework is not
  consistent with an ArchitectureDescriptionLanguage and vice versa)
- operation allGeneralContexts(): ArchitectureContext [*] — computes
  the chain of all contexts that this context inherits
- operation allExtendedContexts(): ArchitectureContext [*] — computes
  the closure of all extended contexts. If context C extends context
  B and B extends context A, then by transitivity C extends context
  A also. But note that extension of contexts is not inherited: a
  context C with a general context B that extends context A does not,
  itself, extend A. But if C does also references A as an extended
  context, then that makes B's extension of A moot when C is also
  present in the architecture registry (the merge algorithm will need
  to account for this)

Constraints in class ArchitectureContext:

- generalizationCycle — an ArchitectureContext must not specialize
  itself, either directly or indirectly
- extensionCycle — an ArchitectureContext must not extend itself,
  either directly or indirectly
- generalNotExtended — none of the extended contexts of an
  ArchitectureContext may extend any of its general contexts as this
  would effectively result in it extending itself. Note that I see
  no reason why a context that is a specialization of another context
  may not also be an extension of yet other contexts, so long as this
  constraint is satisfied
- creationCommandClassRequired — an ArchitectureContext that is not
  an extension must have a creationCommandClass (this replaces the
  previous multiplicity constraint that is now relaxed)
- contextGeneralizationIsConsistent — an ArchitectureContext may only
  specialize a general context that is consistent with it (which for
  now is just that it is of the same class)
- contextExtensionIsConsistent — an ArchitectureContext may only
  extend a context that is consistent with it (which for now is just
  that it is of the same class)

Implement new architecture domain merger with support for legacy semantics:

- three-stage algorithm:
  1. copy source models and perform top-down merges for inheritance
  2. infer extension relationships for legacy implicit (by name) merges
  3. perform bottom-up merges for extension

Other related changes:

- make single consistent item provider factory for the merged architecture facade API
- deprecate and/or replace custom providers in various places in the Papyrus UI
- add plug-in builder check to warn on implicit merges

Patch Set 7:

Patch set 7 adds two changes:

- rebase onto the latest Toolsmiths feature branch which has some new conflicts
- fix a new architecture merge bug found in development of 570542 example plug-in,
  in which representation kinds in the merged model ended up as dangling references
  (not contained in the model) when referenced from a non-extension context but
  owned in the source model by an extension context. This caused NPEs in PolicyChecker
  and related APIs, besides signalling a problem in the merge semantics

The upshot of the second change described above is that it is now possible to add an Architecture Framework with viewpoints referencing new diagram kinds to an existing architecture context, where the new diagram kinds are owned by an Architecture Description Language that extends the existing context but the new Architecture Framework is not an extension because it needs to be able to instantiate models. The example scenario is definition of a new UML Metamodeling framework (similar to the existing UML Profiles framework defined by Papyrus) that adds a new metamodel diagram kind. Because an Architecture Framework cannot own diagram kinds, it references them from an Architecture Description Language that extends the UML language from Papyrus. In the merge result what we want is that the new diagram kind is merged into the UML Language but the Metamodeling framework is _added_ to the Software Engineering domain as a peer to the Profiles framework. This change now makes that work.
