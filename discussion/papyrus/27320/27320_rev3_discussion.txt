Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Several issues with this editor:

- The advanced editor doesn't work in the Model Explorer
- The widget opened from the Sequence diagram is not correct (Blocking dialog instead of lightweight styled text), although it works
- The editor is inconsistent in the Communication Diagram

I'm not sure what the expected behavior really is for this editor. It has been initially implemented for the Communication Diagram, and I'm not sure it even makes sense to use it in the Sequence Diagram (In which the order of messages is represented graphically). And, what about the ModelExplorer, where we don't have any graphical information?

The direct editors also require the diagrams to be regenerated to work properly, and I think Sequence Diagram is not up-to-date.

A more powerful framework for declaring direct editors may be required (Currently, editors are declared on a metaclass, regardless of the edition context)

Let's postpone this task until the requirements are complete & accurate
