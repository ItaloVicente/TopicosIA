Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Several comments on this patch:
- I don't understand why the uml command updater is setting the name to something like "1:name" at line 173. Is the name of the message not simply the text after ":", and the digit before should help rearranging the message?
- code analysis: 
-- when you declare the variable Sring textToEdit = "Not a message", you force the creation of a new String, which will be 99,99% time not used, because the object edited will be a message and textToEdit will be overriden in the if statement. It is better to set it to null when being declared, and add a else clause to the next if statement (and it is also better to use a static string rather than a local created one, and even better with internationalization ;-))
-- NamedElement#getName() can return null, so this line can lead to NPE: textToEdit = messageToEdit.getName().trim();

Issue #1 : I tried to find how pass in this update command  but I don't understand when XText editor is used to set Message text. Have you an idea how access this editor for Message ?

Issue #2 : OK
