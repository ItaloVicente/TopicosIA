DESCRIPTION:

Bug 485220: [Architecture] Provide a more modular architecture
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=485220

Move UI-dependent APIs from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf
bundle to a new org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.emf bundle.  Accordingly
move tests into a new org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.emf.tests bundle.

Now that we have a UI EMF bundle, move the editor-page advices from
the infra.ui bundle into it, which is a more appropriate home for them.

One UI dependency is inverted by introduction of a new
OSGi service a with core interface specified in the non-UI layer:

* IEMFFacetContentProviderResolver is used by the headless EMFHelper
  API to abstract the unwrapping of EMF Facet tree objects to get the
  elements that they encapsulate.  The infra.ui.emf bundle provides the
  implementation of this service

Also, the dialog-settings for the EMF Facet customization manager are
moved into the infra.ui.emf bundle, as is the lazy initialization of
the manager from those settings.  Clients are refactored to get the
customization manager from this new bundle (via a new ProviderHelper
API) to ensure this lazy initialization.

Various UI-dependent ServiceUtilsForXyz classes that were in the
infra.emf bundle but had nothing to do with EMF are moved into the
infra.ui bundle.

UI-dependent classes from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf.readonly
bundle are moved into the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.emf, also.
These include extraction of the editor reload listener from the
ReadOnlyManager class by means of a new general-purpose
IReadOnlyManagerProcessor OSGi service interface.

Tests all still pass (inasmuch as they do in the nightly master builds).

It shouldn't be useful anymore, as EMF Facet TreeElements now properly implement IAdaptable (And are not EObjects anymore). We can simply remove the EMF Facet-specific code from EMFHelper

Ah, interesting.  I'll test that.

(although it does seem odd to me that these tree nodes should adapt to an interface that they implement Java-wise by returning some other object)
