DESCRIPTION:

Bug 485220: [Architecture] Provide a more modular architecture
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=485220

Move UI-dependent APIs from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf
bundle to a new org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.emf bundle.  Accordingly
move tests into a new org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.emf.tests bundle.

Now that we have an UI EMF bundle, move the editor-page advices from
the infra.ui bundle into it, which is a more appropriate home for them.

One UI dependency is removed by reordering of code in the
EMFHelper::getEObject(Object) API:

* the EMF Facet tree elements are once again IAdaptables, providing
  their encapsulated EObjects or EReferences as adapters. So, the
  case handling IAdaptable is moved ahead of the test for is-an-EObject
  because these tree elements are also EObjects but are not interesting
  in themselves

Also, the dialog-settings for the EMF Facet customization manager are
moved into the infra.ui.emf bundle, as is the lazy initialization of
the manager from those settings.  Clients are refactored to get the
customization manager from this new bundle (via a new ProviderHelper
API) to ensure this lazy initialization.

Various UI-dependent ServiceUtilsForXyz classes that were in the
infra.emf bundle but had nothing to do with EMF are moved into the
infra.ui bundle.

UI-dependent classes from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf.readonly
bundle are moved into the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.emf, also.
These include extraction of the editor reload listener from the
ReadOnlyManager class by means of a new general-purpose
IReadOnlyManagerProcessor OSGi service interface.

Tests all still pass (inasmuch as they do in the nightly master builds).

Patch Set 5:

Patch set 5 address the comment about EMF Facet tree objects' adaptability by removing the new service interface for unwrapping them.  This does require updating the EMFHelper API to check for the IAdaptable case first, otherwise these tree objects would just pass through because they are already EObjects.
