DESCRIPTION:

Bug 517404: [CSS] Label margins applied to labels of nested elements

Let subclasses override the label-margin refresh to perform a
non-recursive application of the margins instead of the default
recursive application of margins to all labels in the figure
hierarchy.

A less risky fix that factors out the current recursive margin setting behaviour into protected APIs that subclasses can override to choose instead a non-recursive implementation.

The default remains as is for compatibility and stability of base Papyrus, but Papyrus-RT and other applications can easily choose the other algorithm.

As the margins, themselves, are determine by CSS, so should the recursive application of those margins.  This patch does that.  Applications such as Papyrus-RT can then customize the behaviour in their own stylesheets (works for my scenario).
