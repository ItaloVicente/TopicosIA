Bug 517404: [CSS] Label margins applied to labels of nested elements

Fix the updating of margins in name label figures to process only
those that visualize the same element as the edit-part initiating
the refresh.

Mickael, Céline,

You both are much more familiar with the GEF implementations of the diagrams than I am and have both worked on the code involved in this bug.  I would very much appreciate your opinion on whether this patch has unintended consequences, in particular whether it will miss the setting of margins for label figures that depend on the current algorithm for finding figures to update.

Thanks!

hi,
I have tried to reproduce the bug, but don't find the issue. I've create a composite with class and other element in it, than I have set CSS: Component{topMarginLabel:20;}. Only label of component was affected, not inner elements.

How can I reproduce the bug in an UML diagram? If not I will try it in RT.

Thanks for looking into this!

I think the usual ways of triggering refresh in the diagram do a recursive refresh over the edit-part tree, so when the top composite shape's refresh applies the margins to nested parts, those margins are overridden when those part shapes are refreshed.  So, in this case, the diagram is doing redundant updates to nested figures, but there is no other user-facing impact.

The scenario that we have in Papyrus-RT involves the Canonical Edit Policy, which on the initial layout of a diagram when it is first created and populated with views does non-recursive refreshes of subsets of edit-parts.  In this case, we see the composite shape refreshing, then nested parts, and finally the top composite shape again.  This last refresh then applies composite's own label margins to all nested labels, including the labels of part and port shapes, overriding their preferred margins.  An explicit refresh using the toolbar button (or F5 key) then is recursive over the whole diagram, restoring the correct margins.

So, I don't know whether this bug is reproducible in Papyrus, but it is in Papyrus-RT according to the steps described in bug 514536.

An alternative that would work for Papyrus-RT is to change the visibility of the refreshLabelMargins() method to protected (it is currently private) so that we can change its implementation in our composite edit-part.

Would you prefer that?  It's probably safer at this stage in the Oxygen release, anyways.
