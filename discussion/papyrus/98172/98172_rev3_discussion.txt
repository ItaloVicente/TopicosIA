DESCRIPTION:

Bug 517404: [CSS] Label margins applied to labels of nested elements

Let the CSS stylesheet specify whether the label-margin refresh is
a recursive application of margins to all labels in the figure
hierarchy.  The default value for the new 'marginLabelRecursive'
attribute is 'true' to maintain the current behaviour.

Sorry to nag, but it is quite important to Papyrus-RT to have our layout issues fixed in the Oxygen release for our 1.0, and this problem is blocking that.  I will be happy with any of the three variations of patch that I have proposed here.  Opinions on which is best at this stage in the release?  Time is running out!

No worries, Mickael.  I don't want to distract you from other priorities.  I'm happy if you could suggest another committer/contributor who can help, also.  I'm just concerned about the potential impact of changes in a core component like this so late in the release, that we will have room to fix/revert if something goes badly wrong. :-)

Bug can be reproduce: margin labels from children are set.
With patch: no more issue: the edit part only set its labels and not its children margin.
IMHA its a bug and the "marginLabelRecursive" is not necessary.

Thanks, Mickael!  I really appreciate it.  So, you're saying that you prefer the first patch?

I do tend to agree that it's a bug, but the algorithm so specifically finds figures recursively that I needed to consult the experts that it wasn't actually intended in this case, that there isn't some diagram depending on the recursive nature.  Yes, the new CSS attribute feels like a hack, but its purpose was to reduce the risk for the release.  I'll be quite happy to go ahead with the first patch if that's the consensus.

Yes the first one was good for me too.
I don't know if the recursive aspect is used somewhere.
If someone else have an opinion :)

This is just a rebase of the first patch set again, as per discussion.
