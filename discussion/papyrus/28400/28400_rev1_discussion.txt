All of these new checks for null active window are in code that either looks for the current selection or looks for currently active editors.  Maybe I'm being picky or paranoid, but it worries me that the handlers would be doing this when the workbench window is not active, because it doesn't make sense.  We can only interact with these handlers in the workbench window, which then is necessarily active.  Why is this code running when there is no active window and does that indicate some logical bug?

Vector?  That was obsolete in JDK 1.2.  This should be an ArrayList (yes, I know, this isn't your code ;-)

Why would an action handler be trying to update the workbench selection if the workbench is not active?  Is there something "bigger" going wrong here?

I think the issue is that this code may be called during the "refresh enabled status" of Handlers, and the workbench/window may not be available (yet/anymore) during either startup or shutdown.

Not sure exactly why/when this happens, but we've already had to fix a lot of similar issues
