> why did you delete this one?

The C/C++ code generator has been moved to designer as well, so it should be removed from the Papyrus setup, no? (it referemces the extraplugins/codegen folder which does no longer exist)

The question is whether the ooomph setup within the main Papyrus repository can/should reference plugins/features that are in different repositories.
If we do not remove the entries, we would have to modify them (reference right repository, remove acceleo dependency). Camille, do you have an idea about that?

> Francois: ... I was referring to this snipped of code that you have deleted? It seems to be related to east-adl?

I actually deleted the Java part only, but the output of diff is confusing, since the EAST-ADL section has an identical part compared to the Java section (generic stream configuration).
