The changes look good to me. Just one comment about the severity of model-validation issues
Line:392, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types/src-gen/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/types/util/ElementTypesConfigurationsValidator.java -> Is "Warning" the default severity, or was this specified explicitly? Apply to all types inconsistencies should be reported as errors, as the main case is when an externally referenced type was deleted, and the corresponding advice remains (With no target, so it implicitly becomes an "Apply to all types" advice; which is probably not what we expect).

Line:392, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types/src-gen/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/types/util/ElementTypesConfigurationsValidator.java -> No, this overrides the generated default, which is error severity.

I agree that it makes sense in the case of no target that not having the applyToAllTypes should be flagged as an error. But in the case that a target is set, it could still be a warning. Or perhaps a warning if the advice is owned (in which case the target is really quite obvious) and an error otherwise?
