DESCRIPTION:

Merge branch 'bugs/568782-advice-children' into bugs/568494-toolsmiths-dev

- define a new relationship for advice bindings owned by an element type configuration
- inverse is a new "owningTarget" that is a subset of "target"
- edit support to fix ownership of advice when editing the "target" superset
- add a constraint that "apply to all types" must be false if a target is specified
- ensure delegation of builder-oriented validator to the package's generated validator
- fix automatic module name of a vaguely related bundle
- update element type registry to find all element-type-owned advice configs
- update UML Element Types model to for owned advice configurations
- regenerate models that extend the AbstractAdviceBindingConfiguration. This includes
  - fixing Java source compatibility in the affected genmodels for Java 11
  - updating the copyright templates in those genmodels in case of new generated files
  - fixing broken registration of EMF.Edit creation extenders
- account for subclasses in custom dependency constraints
- remove custom dependency constraints that are redundant with model constraints
- fix test regressions caused by new Element Types Set Configuration dependency check
- generate tests for model operations and constraints
- update test model to make advices owned that are used by tests
- address code review comment
- fix test case being lost in code generation
- set proper name on custom test case so that it runs
- fix stand-alone (Eclipse-free) execution of tests
- ensure that existing models that now will violate the apply_to_all_types constraint will still load at run-time
- log warnings from validation, not just errors, and consolidate into a single log event
- regenerate the Element Types Configurations Editor for live validation support
- fix Papyrus's own types models to comply with the apply_to_all_types constraint
- account for platform:/resource URIs in the ClassLoaderHelper
