DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533667: the name
/plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.extensionpoints.editors do
not respect the layer

Keep the old plugin "org.eclipse.papyrus.extensionpoints.editors" and
create the new one
"org.eclipse.papyrusinfra.gmfdiag.extensionpoints.editors".
The old classes inherit from the new ones.

I can't see why the major were updated when all you did was redirect the calls. The diagrams are not changed (at least what I looked in diagram.common) so I am puzzled as to why. Did I miss something ?

The major modification of org.eclipse.papyrus.extensionpoints.editors is needed because the inherit change.
But i will check the version modification for diagrams because i have some doubts about this changes.

After checking about major modification of diagrams, these changes are correct because the configuration of EditParts ('protected IDirectEditorConfiguration configuration;') changes. This introduce a major change.
