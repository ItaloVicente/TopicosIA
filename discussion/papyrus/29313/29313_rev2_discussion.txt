Patch Set 2:

Context of this test : 
This test case model is used as a basis of a JUnit test case. The JUnit part uses the factory generator provided by Moka. In the test case, a Factory is generated for class Tester. The JUnit test case then executes the generated Factory. The test case validates that the Factory has been correctly generated by observing that some properties actually emerge from the execution of the Factory. In this case, a Tester object will be instantiated (as well as its part component), their classifier behavior will be started, and some comunictions will occur between each other. A call to AssertEquals in the classifier behavior of Tester is used to assert that everything happened correctly.
