Christian, I have no doubts that this patch itself fixes the problem. 
Still I am not sure what is the actual policy about the contributing if the assistant models, because we only have them for ClassD and UseCaseD. 
So I decided it is worth checking with you, whether the addition of the profilediagram.assistants is good / expected for you

It looks good to me, and we don't need a +1 from Hudson because there's no build impact (the failure was a routine time-out).

The "policy" is that the owner of each diagram is expected to provide an Assistants model suitably tailored to the most typical usage of their diagram.  I provided Class and Use Case diagram assistants as examples because I think I understand these diagrams reasonably well, but we need experts in each diagram to do the rest.
