DESCRIPTION:

Bug 440910: [API] Implement API Tooling builder in Papyrus source projects https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=440910

Configure Papyrus Java projects for API analysis, with the
exception of:

* test bundles
* developer tools bundles

Add a pseudo-test to the BundleTests JUnit suite that, when
activated by the required system properties, generates a report
of the API changes since the specified baseline release.  The
apiDeltaReport test case can be run in both the Hudson build and
development environments.

Hi,

This proposition is very interesting and seems working fine.
But the api baseline will be integrated with tycho in the next version 
(O.24.0/ end of the month/ Demo in Eclipse Con Europe )

I think it will be better to use/contribute their integration, since it will be the one used by most of the eclipse project.

See (end of page): https://wiki.eclipse.org/Tycho/Release_Notes/0.24

Benoit

Ps : we can still activate the tooling in the .project  files

It is my understanding that the new mojo's purpose is to validate bundle version numbers, failing if they do not meet the Eclipse versioning guidelines.  Does it also produce a detailed report of all of the API changes?  I don't think that it does.  That report is my purpose in this review.  The validation might be a useful additional step if we want it, but then it would repeat the cost of the API baseline comparison.

@Christian : Indeed, my (hidden :)) question was : Why not propose this awesome feature to tycho? (I think a lot of projects would be interested in this kind of report)

Probably, they would.  There are a few reasons why I hesitate to propose this particular implementation of the report as a contribution to Tycho:

* it makes extensive use of internal PDE APIs (such report couldn't be done, otherwise).  I wouldn't propose such code for Tycho without first seeing PDE refactored to publish supported APIs.  Or, indeed, it could be proposed to PDE as a Tycho extension, which would be the first instance of such extension in that project

* it's nice to have the report running in the JUnit execution because that works nicely in the development environment (not just in the build).  I don't know how an implementation in Tycho might be reused in that context

This is obsolete.  Eventual resumption of this effort would need a new patch.
