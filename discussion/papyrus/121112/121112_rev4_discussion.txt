DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533527 - [xtext, properties] The xtext editor in the property view is not shown correctly

- Pass current object as semantic as well as selected object (instead of null)
- Pass by editor to get selection. This assures that we get the right selection, even
  if the properties view is selected
