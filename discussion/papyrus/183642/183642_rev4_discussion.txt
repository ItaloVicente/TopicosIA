DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574094: [Toolsmiths - Properties Editor] Unmodified XWT files are saved/reformatted

The mechanism of trying to create an output stream to test for writability of a resource
truncates the resource to 0 bytes, after which it is (usually) saved again with full
content. But that defeats EMF's save-only-if-modified-by-memory-buffer strategy.

Instead, give the editing domain specific knowledge of ppe: URI scheme and use
heuristics supported by EMF (including URI schemes and URIConverter) to test for
real read-only condition and also, while saving, provide ephemeral read-only state
for resources that are not modified. This prevents unmodified but otherwise writable
XWT resources being saved again with slightly rearranged but otherwise identical content.

I can change attributes of the layout, add widgets, remove widgets, in various sections. I always see the changes saved in the section XWT files.

I've tested this patch on top of the Properties branch. My models were pushed to Git, and Git staging only showed changes for the *.ctx file. I'll investigate this a bit further, to see if I can find more info about the issue.

Patch Set 4:

The problem is (again :) ) related to the Preview view, which saves the XWT Resource to a temporary location, in order to display it. This resets the modified flag to "False". Then, the real save action will consider that this resource is already saved.

Blame 2010-me for this weird usage of the Resource#save method :D
