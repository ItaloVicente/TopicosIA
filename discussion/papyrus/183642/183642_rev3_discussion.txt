DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574094: [Toolsmiths - Properties Editor] Unmodified XWT files are saved/reformatted

The mechanism of trying to create an output stream to test for writability of a resource
truncates the resource to 0 bytes, after which it is (usually) saved again with full
content. But that defeats EMF's save-only-if-modified-by-memory-buffer strategy.

Instead, give the editing domain specific knowledge of ppe: URI scheme and use
heuristics supported by EMF (including URI schemes and URIConverter) to test for
real read-only condition and also, while saving, provide ephemeral read-only state
for resources that are not modified. This prevents unmodified but otherwise writable
XWT resources being saved again with slightly rearranged but otherwise identical content.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

The original issue is solved (I guess :D ), but now, any change to the sections (*.xwt files) is simply always ignored, never saved. At least, they're not reformatted 😊

I've tried various operations on a Section, such as rearranging the controls, or adding new (arbitrary) elements. The Editor appears as dirty (as expected), but when I save, *.xwt files are not modified at all. Changes on the *.ctx model are properly applied, though.

Hmm. I just tested this patch again, and I don't see this problem. I can reorder widgets, save the property context editor, and I see the XWT test updated. I can change attributes of the layout, add widgets, remove widgets, in various sections. I always see the changes saved in the section XWT files.

Are you sure you're looking into the right files for saved changes? I did test this after rebasing the patch on the latest master, assuming that I would need to push new changes.
