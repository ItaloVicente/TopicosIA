Dear all,
as discussed by email, I will push each fonctionnality of codegen into a separate commit .
The first one is specific to activate xtend in a specific plugin css.
I have modified at minimal the pom to ease the integration.
Thanks to look precisely to the modifications.
Francois

Thanks, Fran?ois!  This looks good.  I have a few questions in the in-line comments, mostly for my education, I think.  ;-)
Line:23, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> I didn't need this in my Xtend-generated plug-ins on my feature branch because Tycho constructs the build path from the JDT metadata in the .classpath file and/or build.properties. Are you sure this helper is necessary?

Line:48, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> Should we have a <version>${xtext.version}</version> here for clarity?  I think it's inherited from the <pluginManagement> in the parent POM, but in most maven projects that I have seen (which is not many) the version is always specified where an artifact is referenced, using a variable, of course.

However, I'll defer to the maven expert on this question because I am far from expert.

Line:53, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> If we don't need these, then they should just be deleted.

Christian
I have tried to answer the different questions you mentionned.

For version property, I will keep it as it.
For comment goal, I will change if you want

The harder question is about the maven helper plugin, because I do not have enough background to understand clearly tycho and maven role.
I will do as you prefere: do I remove the section? both are working but perhaps could interfer ?

I appreciate your help.

Line:20, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> adding in the source path the different folders

Line:23, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> At first, badly I am not a tycho expert and only perhaps a junior for maven...
So I have some difficulty to understand the role of tycho.
If it was 100% pure maven, I would put it sure.

If you want i can remove it.

Line:44, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> calling the plugin with the minmal configuration

Line:48, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> Initialy in maven, there were not the plugin management section, so people use to reference variable for plugin version.
Here I have clearly define the varaible and the plugin version on the top main pom.
They are not need to use again xtext.version.

Line:53, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> Christian, 
I will do as you prefer.
In my previous group we use to keep additional information with comment.
Here for example, my purpose was to highlight the fact that these goals could be use in a near feature.

I will do as you want.
do i keep it or not?

Line:313, releng/top-pom-main.xml -> adding specific version properties

Line:445, releng/top-pom-main.xml -> declaration of plugin version in the right section

Thanks!

Agreed.

Yes, please. :-)

Yes, please, and (as I mentioned in the in-line comments) the maven compiler plug-in.  The less "code" (whether Java or maven) the better, IMHO.   Best just to let Tycho do its magic.
Line:19, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> I missed this the last time, sorry.  This isn't necessary, either, because we already inherit the Tycho build plug-in from the parent POM.  We don't need the maven-compiler-plugin to do the Java compilation step.

Line:23, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> Hah!  I look to you as the maven expert.  :-P

Yes, a simple Java project would need this, but Tycho does not need it because it is driven by Eclipse's project metadata.  Remove the build-helper-maven-plugin and you will see that all of the generated code is compiled by Tycho and ends up in the JAR.

Let's stream-line the POM by removing this.

Line:48, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> OK, if this is the modern convention, then I'm happy.  Thanks!

Line:53, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/css/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.css.xtext/pom.xml -> Anybody working on these plug-ins should know the goals that they need to implement.  :-)

I just always complain about commented-out "code", because it always raises questions for anyone that has to maintain the code:  why is this commented out?  Should it be reinstated?  When should it be reinstated?  What will happen if it is reinstated?  Best not to let developers bother themselves with such questions, so I always ask for commented-out code simply to be removed.

So, yes I would prefer to see this deleted.
