DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533673: [Sequence Diagram] CombinedFragment should be created with one InteractionOperand

Add an edit-helper advice to resize the default operand of a new
combined fragment to fill the available space in the combined
fragment.  As this needs to use the edit-part controlling the
operand's presentation to obtain a command that resizes the operand
and captures the interaction fragments within its bounds, the
execution of this advice command is deferred and captured back into
the original context for undo/redo.

The behavior works fine. This looks good to me.

But, one JUnit test is currently in failure with this patch:

java.lang.AssertionError: Height too small
Expected: greater than <170>
     but: was <167>

Thanks, Nicolas.  You're on a Linux system?  This looks like a variance in the font sizing; the usual bugbear in our diagram tests.  I'll adjust the tolerance.

I'm on a windows system with 100% DPI.
