DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533673: [Sequence Diagram] CombinedFragment should be created with one InteractionOperand

Add an edit-helper advice to resize the default operand of a new
combined fragment to fill the available space in the combined
fragment.  As this needs to use the edit-part controlling the
operand's presentation to obtain a command that resizes the operand
and captures the interaction fragments within its bounds, the
execution of this advice command is deferred and captured back into
the original context for undo/redo.

This rebases the change on top of today's series of clean-up commits from Camille that deleted dead code all over the place.  My new JUnit test still passes, and is now incorporated into the test suite that would run in the build.
