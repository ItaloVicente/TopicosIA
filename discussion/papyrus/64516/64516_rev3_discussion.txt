DESCRIPTION:

Bug 485220: [Architecture] Provide a more modular architecture
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=485220

Move UI-dependent APIs from the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints
bundle to a new org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints.ui bundle.
Replace usage of ISelection and IStructuredSelection in Constraint and
ConstraintEngine API methods with Object and Collection<?>,
respectively.

Move the ElementTypesPreferences class from the
infra.elementtypesconfigurations bundle to a new
infra.elementtypesconfigurations.ui bundle.  For compatibility, it still
persists its data via an `IMemento` in the preferences of the
core `infra.elementtypesconfigurations` bundle.  It implements a new
provider extension interface that allows the core bundle's
element-type registry to call out to it to get user-defined element
types from the workspace.

Move the RuntimeValuesEditionAdviceEditHelperAdvice class and some of
its attendants from the infra.elementtypesconfigurations.emf bundle to
the new infra.elementtypesconfigurations.ui bundle because it needs to
open the EditionDialog to let the user edit objects.

Likewise the similar APIs in the infra.extendedtypes bundle, including
also the entire providers package for action-providers, with the
ExtendedElementTypeActionService class, the
IExtendedElementTypeActionProvider interface, and the corresponding
extension point namespace.

Move the ElementTypeValidator class from the infra.services.edit bundle
to a new infra.services.edit.ui bundle.

Other fixes for simple inessential UI dependencies and also conflicts in
bundle classpaths (such as in the Sequence Diagram particularly) that
cause deadlocks in class loading in a complete Papyrus environment, such
as the AllTests suite.

Factor the UI dependencies out of the infra.onefile bundle into a new
infra.onefile.ui bundle.

Tests all still pass (inasmuch as they do in the nightly master builds).

First remarks, I will continue.
Line:53, extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> question for me: every time, I ask me when we need to put [1.2.0,)
why we do not use it?

Line:57, extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> in sysml, we have decided to group together plugin that come from papyrus.
perhaps it is the good time to order them in papyrus?
but not mandatory.

Line:20, features/papyrus-tests-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.tests.infra.services.feature/feature.xml -> why sometimes we use fragment and other time not?
at MHO, why we do not use everytime fragment, to ensure that the test plugin to not add too many additional dependencies?

Line:34, plugins/customization/org.eclipse.papyrus.customization.properties/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/customization/properties/modelelement/CustomizationModelElement.java -> when we have a dependency against an UI plugin, should we take the convention to say the plugin it self contains the UI word?
org.eclipse.papyrus.customization.properties.ui ?

Line:32, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.log/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/log/LogHelper.java -> why do we need such class?
why we do not use the official eclipse logger?
org.eclipse.e4.core.services

http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseLogging/article.html

Line:25, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints.ui/.project -> why not adding maven nature?
I am ready to do it after, with agreement.

Line:8, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints.ui/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> why we do not factorize all prefs with the follwoing maven plugin ?

<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-eclipse-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.9</version>

http://www.martijndashorst.com/blog/2014/07/15/eclipse-settings/

Line:22, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints.ui/plugin.xml -> removing the comment?

Line:8, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints.ui/pom.xml -> I have proposed to have intermediate pom, that will allow to have a more clear view of the architecture.

Line:12, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints.ui/pom.xml -> could be removed?

Line:5, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints/.classpath -> may we group the generrated code under a target folder?
to enhance the fact the code should not be touch manually?

Secund quick review.
At this time, I just look quickly at all modifications
Line:8, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.elementtypesconfigurations.invarianttypes/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> great to have find this! I am sure that one of my error was comming from those ui plugin!

Line:20, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.elementtypesconfigurations.ui/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/elementtypesconfigurations/internal/ui/LogUtil.java -> anyidea why elementtypes need its own logging utility?

Line:11, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.elementtypesconfigurations/build.properties -> are we sure we want to exclude this one? as it is referenced by plugin.xml ?

Line:11, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.extendedtypes.emf/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> if we have clear separated reposiotry and pom configuration (target/repsootory) list, we will not be able to add depdencies without modifying the main pom. That's why I would like we separate things in terms of repsoitories.

Line:3, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.extendedtypes.ui/.project -> do we need to take care all of this, if we decide not to put them in 2.0 ?

Line:11, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.extendedtypes.ui/build.properties -> why specifiy jar order compialtion ?

Line:40, releng/main-tests/pom.xml -> may we create intermediate pom?
where we group plugin and their test fragment together ?

Line:107, releng/main/pom.xml -> may we group together with intermediate pom?
may we create feature for those element without the ui and feature the ui elements?

Line:3, tests/junit/plugins/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.elementtypesconfigurations.tests/.classpath -> why do we need to rpecise the 1.7 here?

Line:27, tests/junit/plugins/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.elementtypesconfigurations.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/elementtypesconfigurations/ui/tests/AllTests.java -> could this set of classes be replaced by a launch configuration? and let eclipse/tycho surefire plugin execute the tests by its own? in order to match the continuous integration build?

Line:51, tests/junit/plugins/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.elementtypesconfigurations.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/elementtypesconfigurations/ui/tests/ElementTypesRegistryTests.java -> should we use a variable and not a string ?
to be sure the refactoring is working
to be sure not to add not resolvable dependencies?

Line:1, tests/junit/plugins/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.extendedtypes.ui.tests/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.extendedtypes.ui.tests.launch -> no license for xml files?

Line:3, tests/junit/plugins/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.extendedtypes.ui.tests/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.extendedtypes.ui.tests.launch -> I do prefer to use launch file and not the AllTests.

Line:47, tests/junit/plugins/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.tests/test/org/eclipse/papyrus/tests/AllTests.java -> does suite tests correspond to integration test?
if so, why not use the appropriate tycho maven plugin for integration test?

Thanks, François, for your review.  I've made some changes and answered your questions as well as I can.  I hope those answers are satisfactory.
Line:53, extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I don't understand the question.  Are you asking why this dependency version range is not expressed as "[1.2.0,)"?  That's exactly what "1.2.0".

Personally, I think it's wrong, because this version range includes Papyrus version 2.0, 3.0, and 100.0, which is silly, but that's how Papyrus does it for now.  When we have committed to Papyrus 2.0, we will have to change to a proper semantic versioning scheme, but that will be a new/separate task.

Line:57, extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> What do you mean by "group together"?  All of these bundles are grouped into features which, now that you mention it, probably also need to be re-thought.  But again, that's a separate problem, because the feature structure really has nothing to do with the dependencies between bundles.

Line:20, features/papyrus-tests-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.tests.infra.services.feature/feature.xml -> That's a good question.  Our use of fragments for tests causes the PDE tooling much confusion and I would much prefer that all tests be in plug-in bundles.  I have no idea where this fragment convention came from or why.

Line:34, plugins/customization/org.eclipse.papyrus.customization.properties/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/customization/properties/modelelement/CustomizationModelElement.java -> I would rather have org.eclipse.papyrus.customization.ui.properties.  I definitely support that kind of consistent naming of UI bundles.  We would have also org.eclipse.papyrus.ui.editor, for example, instead of org.eclipse.papyrus.editor even though "editor" clearly implies a UI aspect.

The typical pattern established by all other Eclipse projects is like so:

    <base-project-namespace>.*
    <base-project-namespace>.ui.*

for the basic architectural division of headless and UI bundles.  So, in Papyrus, we would have

    org.eclipse.papyrus.*
    org.eclipse.papyrus.ui.*

This refactoring could be done as a second phase.  I welcome comments from the rest of the committer team on this subject.

Line:32, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.log/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/log/LogHelper.java -> Papyrus is older than e4, so perhaps this is now an anachronism.  But I don't think Papyrus has any plans (yet) to adopt the e4 platform, as such, especially the dependency injection framework.  That's out of the scope of this refactoring effort, anyways.

Line:25, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints.ui/.project -> Actually, I just tried running the "Convert to Maven Project" action on this bundle and I don't like the results:

* the bin/ folder is no longer an output folder (the target/ folder)
* build.properties file was not updated by M2E, so it still thinks bin/ is the output folder

I think this should wait until we decide how to convert all of the projects to M2E nature.

Line:8, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints.ui/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs -> Cool, I didn't know about that.  Could you raise a new enhancement in bugzilla to look into that?

Line:22, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints.ui/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:12, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints.ui/pom.xml -> Why can this be removed?  Isn't it required?

Line:5, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.constraints/.classpath -> Maybe, but I think it best to stick with the current Papyrus convention in this API refactoring.  That should be a consideration for the task tracking conversion of the projects to M2E nature?  The team should discuss how best to deal with generated code in an M2E context.

Line:20, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.elementtypesconfigurations.ui/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/elementtypesconfigurations/internal/ui/LogUtil.java -> The bundle doesn't need an activator, but still had code that was using the LogUtil that usually is provided by an Activator class in Papyrus.  Instead of using another bundle's identity in the logs (which would confuse the origin of message), I though it best to do this instead of adding an activator that we don't need.  Perhaps it's not worth it ...

Line:11, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.elementtypesconfigurations/build.properties -> You're right, I overthought this point.  I did that because it's an internal extension point only, not meant for extenders of Papyrus to use.  If extenders really have a need to use this extension point, they should have that opportunity (it's the same reason why internal packages are exported even though they're not meant to be used by other bundles).

I've removed all such exclusions.

Line:3, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.extendedtypes.ui/.project -> I don't know.  This API isn't deprecated, it seems very similar to the elementtypesconfigurations bundles, but also does more.  Perhaps Rémi can comment on that.

Line:11, plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.extendedtypes.ui/build.properties -> It doesn't seem necessary when there's only one JAR to be built, does it?  I've never given it any thought; PDE just generates the file this way.  Removing it doesn't seem to cause any problem.

Line:40, releng/main-tests/pom.xml -> I prefer to leave that to a separate phase, once the API refactorings are done, because that won't have the same kind of impact on developers (especially extenders who work with the Papyrus SDK distribution).

Line:3, tests/junit/plugins/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.elementtypesconfigurations.tests/.classpath -> Because the bundle declares 1.7 as its required execution environment.  Without this, JDT doesn't actually use the correct JRE for compilation, so it could end up using Java platform APIs that aren't available in the 1.7 environment.

Line:27, tests/junit/plugins/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.elementtypesconfigurations.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/elementtypesconfigurations/ui/tests/AllTests.java -> Perhaps eventually, when the build is re-designed.  But not in this API refactoring.  :-)

Line:51, tests/junit/plugins/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.elementtypesconfigurations.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/elementtypesconfigurations/ui/tests/ElementTypesRegistryTests.java -> Done

Line:1, tests/junit/plugins/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.extendedtypes.ui.tests/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.extendedtypes.ui.tests.launch -> The JDT's launch configuration tooling doesn't preserve comments, so a copyright comment would just be wiped out (I tried it).

It's okay, I suppose:  there isn't anything of intellectual property value in these files.

Line:47, tests/junit/plugins/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.tests/test/org/eclipse/papyrus/tests/AllTests.java -> I think somebody just chose to put the AllTests class in a separate package from the other test classes.  I don't know why.  But they aren't integration-style tests; they seem to be closer to unit-style.
