DESCRIPTION:

[CDO Integration] Fix sash model problem

The CDOSashModelProvider was not used because it was still registered
with the old "cdo" scheme. "cdo.checkout" is correct.

I also changed CDOSashModelProvider to store sash models directly in
the checkout folder on disk, so it'll be deleted with the checkout.
