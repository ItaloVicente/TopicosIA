DESCRIPTION:

Bug 511776 - [Composite Structure Diagram] Ports have no symbol compartment

- Add symbol compartment to all elements that implement RoundedBorderNamedElementEditPart
- Support position-dependent shape, if the filename contains a magic key: e.g. shape.position.svg will be replaced
  by shape.north|west|east|south.svg, depending on the position.

The difference in patch set 4 is that now always a default position is used, for instance when no active editor is found and thus the position can not be determined. This happens during the first load of a model.

I also tested the "save-as" SVG file and found that the SVG file is much too big for the port. However, the scaling is also completely wrong for shapes in the symbol compartment of a class, so the error is not related to the new symbol in port feature. I found that there is already a bug for this since more than one year: bug 465575
