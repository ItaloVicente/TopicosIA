The https://ci.eclipse.org/papyrus/job/Papyrus-Master-Functional-Tests build job shows these tests running.  Most of them fail, but that is not the purpose of this change.

Also, there appears to be duplication of purpose between one set of tests from 3 weeks ago and another set that is about 8 weeks old:  it looks like the newer tests started from a copy of the older tests, changed them, and added some.  Again, it is not the in the scope of this bug to determine the specific tests or suites to run.

Once this is merged to master, I can update the build job to test the master branch and to be triggered by completion of the RCP build.

Verified per https://ci.eclipse.org/papyrus/job/Papyrus-Master-Functional-Tests/5/console which shows execution of tests and reporting of results (happens to be a build failure, but that's expected because the tests fail).
