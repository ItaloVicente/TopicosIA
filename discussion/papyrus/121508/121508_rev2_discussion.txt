DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533683: [Sequence Diagram] Deletion of the last InteractionOperand should delete containing CombinedFragment

Add a delete-dependents advice for InteractionOperands that checks
whether an operand being deleted from a combined fragment will leave
that combined fragment without any operands, and if so, deletes the
combined fragment, also.

There's one case missing, that doesn't seem to work: when deleting the last N Operands, the fragment is not deleted. I've also not seen a test for this case (Although the code seems to support that, so I'm a little bit surprised)

Well, it works when deleting all of the operands in one action in the Model Explorer, because that delete command handler creates a single edit-request for deletion of all of the operands.  So, the edit-helper advice can see that all of the operands are going to be deleted.

The problem is in the diagram, where each operand edit-part is separately requested to provide a deletion command, and the resulting commands are composed together.  These commands are independent, having no knowledge of one another, so the advice is going to have to track these requests in some bigger context than the actual edit-request.

Hmm I thought we had already worked on the handlers to unify their behavior, between the ModelExplorer and Diagram.

It might be worth triggering a discussion on the mailing list to clarify if this difference is really intended & necessary.

IMO, both handlers (DeleteCommandHandler, and DeleteFromModelCommandHandler) should delegate to DeleteActionUtil, and DeleteActionUtil should be updated to support multi-selection.

Anyway, this is probably a more general issue (Not related to the SeqD/Operands, since, as you say, your code works fine from the ModelExplorer), so that can be handled in a different ticket
