DESCRIPTION:

Bug 530201: [Sequence Diagram] Covered feature is broken for InteractionFragment

Ensure that all interaction fragments that can be created in an
interaction (continuation apparently not supported) are
initialized with lifeline coverage for the lifelines that they
visually cover.  This includes updating the GridManagementEditPolicy
to stop just adding all interaction operands to the 'coveredBys'
of all lifelines in the interaction.
