DESCRIPTION:

Bug 530201: [Sequence Diagram] Covered feature is broken for InteractionFragment

Ensure that all interaction fragments that can be created in an
interaction (continuation apparently not supported) are
initialized with lifeline coverage for the lifelines that they
visually cover.  This includes updating the GridManagementEditPolicy
to stop just adding all interaction operands to the 'coveredBys'
of all lifelines in the interaction.

Thanks for the review.  This update makes a few changes:

- move static operations from the SequenceRequestConstant interface to RequestParameterUtils.  It is not possible to move them to SequenceUtil as requested because that class is in another bundle that depends on the uml.service.types bundle.  But it seems clear that the RequestParameterUtils class is intended for this kind of helper operation
- remove erroneous TODO comment in a test case
- rebase on latest master branch
