Some more updates. It should cover almost all your comments now.

2 things are still missing, that I probably won't have time to handle this month:

- The documentation doesn't contain an hyperlink to the referenced section
- The Plug-in generator doesn't add the required dependencies

Thanks for the updates! Looks good. But I did find a few small issues in the regeneration of the model code.

One thing I missed in my previous review (sorry) because has to do with the element types set configuration ID when re-generating. I didn't notice it before because I used the suggested ID in the wizard, but when re-generating over an existing element types set configuration that had customized this ID, the incremental generation replaced it with the ID from the wizard.  I think either the wizard should load the existing ID when it finds that the resource already exists (but this is complicated by the fact that the wizard has only a prefix, and the existing resource may have an ID that doesn't end with ".elementTypes") or incremental generation should not set the ID of the element type set configuration at all. I think the latter would probably be both easier to implement and more correct (I don't think a user would expect incremental generation to change this ID; at least, I know that I don't).
Line:15, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Oops. Forgot to edit out the regeneration of these re-exports.

Line:15, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types/model/ElementTypesConfigurations.genmodel -> Why lose the operations folder? I suppose it isn't used currently, but if we wanted to add, say, a "getAnnotation(source: String): String [0..1]" operation then we would want to reinstate it.

Line:29, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types/plugin.xml -> I always delete this when it is regenerated, as it must have been explicitly deleted initially. I don't know why, but there must have been a reason. Who could shed some light on that? And should we delete it again here to be safe?

Also, I wonder whether the root element type set configuration should be annotated with a reference to the Profile element from which it was generated? It would be redundant, but could be useful as a consistency check or maybe some weird scenario where all of the element type configurations are deleted?

Thanks again for the review! I'll address all these comments ASAP 😊
Line:15, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Oops. 😞

Line:15, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types/model/ElementTypesConfigurations.genmodel -> That's accidental; it has been automatically removed when I reloaded the Genmodel. I reverted the change in most genmodels, but apparently I missed this one 😊

Line:29, plugins/infra/types/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.types/plugin.xml -> Definitely. It has not been "deleted", but "patched", and regeneration just creates a duplicate version of this extension point (As suggested by the '<!-- @generated not ElementTypesConfigurations -->' comment below)
