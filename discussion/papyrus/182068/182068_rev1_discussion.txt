DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573890: the builder shall informa that org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.common is needed for the AF

- define an annotation to specify additional required bundles for a creation class
- apply this annotation in the GMF Diagram representation model to add
  org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.common as a dependency (.commands is already
  inferred from the classConstraint annotation)
- add missing classConstraint annotation for creation commands in the table
  representation model

This patch adds another annotation for the creation-command attributes of representation-kind models to let the developer specify additional bundle requirements to check when an architecture has a creation command for the representation kind. It also works for model creation/conversion commands.

In testing, I noticed that I had omitted earlier to annotate the creation-command attribute for the Table representation kind with the constraintClass ITableCreationCommand. So I did that here for completeness.

Note that the case of the required org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.commands dependency was already covered by the constraintClass annotation for the Papyrus Diagram representation kind.

This failed because the current target platform on master branch uses an Eclipse Platform integration build that was deleted now that the 2020-06 release is published.
