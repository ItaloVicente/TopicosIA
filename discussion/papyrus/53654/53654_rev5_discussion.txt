Line:58, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/schema/refactorParticipant.exsd -> I added the requirement to extend RefactoringParticipant of LTK layer.

Line:74, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorResourceSetListener.java -> When I change to have an aggregate precommit, my refactoring participant doesn't work anymore.

Line:49, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/ui/PapyrusRefactoringWizard.java -> Now, The UI api of LTK is used to configure by user the refactoring request.

Thanks, Gabriel!  The integration of LTK for refactoring participants, changes, and the UI looks great.

I have only one question remaining, in-line, about what happens in nested transactions.
Line:74, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorResourceSetListener.java -> Hm.  That is odd.  I would expect a consistent sequence of notifications in either case.  How does the refactoring break in that case?  I hope nothing's broken in the transaction ...

If the refactoring participant is invoked multiple times for nested transactions, will a dialog or other UI be presented multiple times to the user?

For the unit tests, I have some difficulties to pass through the read-only service UI. I would declare all tests data as writable before to launch the tests. I am not sure that this is possible.
Line:74, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorResourceSetListener.java -> In that case, the refactoring doesn't detect broken cross-references and does nothing.

Normally, the refactoring service is triggered on the first resource moving and ignores others to avoid the UI is displayed each times. With this behaviour, maybe I miss some refactoring notifications.

So if I can't aggregate the listener, I will have to manage all changes with an  unique request or composed request.

I have not other ideas.

For tests, you could totally disable the read-only mechanism, I think:  create a subclass of the ReadOnlyManager class that simply allows everything to be written.  In your subclass's constructor, add it to the static roHandlers map so that the editing domain and the rest of Papyrus will find it later.  Then, in your test set-up, pre-emptively create an instance of this subclass on your test's editing domain to hook it all together.
Line:74, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorResourceSetListener.java -> Ah, I understand.  Perhaps, then, instead of listening in aggregate mode, the listener could just collect the resource refactorings that it detects in some asynchronous activity via Display.asyncExec, assuming that a dialog will be shown that needs to be on the UI thread anyways.

Line:74, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorResourceSetListener.java -> If I understand your idea, the listener will launch an asynchronous process like Job to resolve all cross-reference.

The interest of the current implementation was the modifications which are embedded in EMF command and executed in the same transaction. With an asynchronous process, how can I ensure that modifications are in the same transaction? Maybe, it doesn't matter.

In this case, should I encapsulate the Refactoring call in an asynchronous activity and forget the EMF command to add in the current transaction?

Perhaps you can have the best of both worlds with asynchronous execution in the transaction pre-commit phase?  Have a look at the executor provided by TransactionHelper::createTransactionExecutor(...).  The DiagramHelper utility uses this, for example.

But, I really am just speculating that asynchronous processing would be necessary to ensure that the user interaction is presented at most once.  It may not be; you would know better than I.

I detected an issue of Concurrent access during saving step.
Line:280, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/service/impl/RefactorService.java -> This line causes a java.util.ConcurrentModificationException with SemanticUMLContentProvider#RootAdapter. I modify resources list when this adapter explore this one.
