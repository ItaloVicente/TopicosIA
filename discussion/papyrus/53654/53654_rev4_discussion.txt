Will a JUnit test suite be following in another Gerrit contribution?
File Comment: plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.resources/plugin.xml -> This file has only whitespace changes; it can be removed from the change set.
Line:37, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/plugin.xml -> Does the term "service" have any meaning to the user?  Maybe just "Refactoring" would be better.

Line:63, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/AbstractRefactorCommand.java -> If the refactoring fails somehow or is cancelled by the user (if that's even possible) then how is that result communicated so that the transaction may roll back?

Line:79, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/AbstractRefactorCommand.java -> Does this and related APIs actually need a ModelSet specifically, or should any kind of ResourceSet be sufficient input?

Line:79, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/RefactorModelResolverCommand.java -> It may not be that it is impossible to get write access, but just that write access is not currently available.  Probably "One or more external resources are read-only" would be better.

Line:82, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/RefactorModelResolverCommand.java -> "affected" (as a matter of English style)

Line:135, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/RefactorModelResolverCommand.java -> Probably shouldn't create the dialog unless and until we know that it needs to be opened ...

Line:136, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/RefactorModelResolverCommand.java -> dele

Line:264, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/RefactorModelResolverCommand.java -> I think this should just be toString() or perhaps toPortableString(), because the OS-specific separators (e.g., Windows-style backslashes) are not appropriate in a platform:/... URI.

And what if the storage isn't in the workspace?  Could it be an absolute file path in the filesystem?  What other kinds of paths are there?  I don't understand the rationale for using IStorage, so I'm probably missing something important ...

Line:308, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/RefactorModelResolverCommand.java -> Or just " roState.or(false) "  :-)

Line:312, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/RefactorModelResolverCommand.java -> or " !make.or(true) "

Although, I think that more correct would be "!make.isPresent() || !make.get()"  (a.k.a. !make.or(false)) because if we don't know whether the resource was made writable, we should assume that it wasn't.

Line:447, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/RefactorModelResolverCommand.java -> The root container could be in a different resource than the object being refactored.  Is that really want we want?  (it may well be, but it's not clear that it is correct)

Line:501, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/RefactorModelResolverCommand.java -> Does this need to be in a finally block?  In case resolveLocalModel(...) throws some kind of exception.

Line:43, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/dependency/RefactorDependencyProvider.java -> I think most of these are coded elsewhere, at least in concrete implementations of the IModel API ...

Line:65, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/dependency/RefactorDependencyProvider.java -> No, the notation model does, too:  its diagrams and tables reference elements in the UML that can move.  Diagram shortcuts even reference other diagrams.

Also, the DI resource can store references to notation objects in the "legacy" model.

But, it seems to me that these cases are covered and it's just that this comment is either incorrect or confusing?

Line:24, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/INotificationMatch.java -> Is it a matcher or a match?  The doc comment disagrees with the type name.

Line:60, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorNotificationFilter.java -> Packages aren't the only UML elements that can be refactored ...

Line:63, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorNotificationFilter.java -> The notifier isn't the object being removed or added.  It's some object in a feature of the notifier that is being removed or added.  So these notifications do not indicate the deletion or addition of a package!

Line:66, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorNotificationFilter.java -> We typically use switch statements on the notification event-type.  And the REMOVE_MANY, ADD_MANY, and SET (replacement) cases must also be handled.

Line:89, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorNotificationFilter.java -> Same comment as above.

Line:136, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorNotificationFilter.java -> Components behave in many ways like Packages (they are buckets of PackageableElements).  Also, classifiers of any kind can contain other UML elements.  Every kind of UML element contains potentially referenceable (and needing refactoring) elements!

Line:251, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorNotificationFilter.java -> REMOVE_MANY, ADD_MANY, SET.

Line:70, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorResourceSetListener.java -> If this is going to be a pre-commit listener (which I agree makes more sense than a post-commit listener), then I think it needs to be an aggregate pre-commit listener, meaning that it will be invoked only before commit of the top-most transaction.  Otherwise, in the case of nested transactions, we may end up running a refactoring operation (with user interaction each time?) for every nested transaction when it commits.

Line:97, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorResourceSetListener.java -> Test first for a match before attempting to get the refactoring service, which involves accessing the registry and can throw exceptions.  That's work that should be avoided when there are lots of notifications ...

Line:134, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorResourceSetListener.java -> If we can't get the refactoring service, then we're going to spam the log for every notification.  This should only be logged once:  we should remember that the service is not available and not try again to get it.

Line:58, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/participant/ImpactedResourceDialog.java -> The word "dialog" should not appear in a window title.

Perhaps "Refactor Resources" would be better.

Line:73, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/participant/ImpactedResourceDialog.java -> "action"

Line:73, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/participant/ImpactedResourceDialog.java -> This should not be capitalized.

Line:29, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/participant/StorageLabelProvider.java -> This is never actually used.

Line:64, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/request/EMFRefactorRequest.java -> No, it doesn't.  ;-)

Line:39, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/request/IRefactorRequest.java -> Is this the object that is being moved/renamed/deleted etc?  And how do we know what is being done to it and what is the new name/location/etc. of the object?

Line:69, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/request/IRefactorRequest.java -> Should this be a URI?  So much of the API is in terms of URIs or resources, not Resources, themselves ...

Line:83, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/request/IRefactorRequest.java -> Should be 'isCancelled' (and likewise the setter)

Line:31, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/request/IResourceRefactorRequest.java -> Why in terms of storage?

Choosing a scope doesn't sound like something that should make any changes to any model resources.

Line:54, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/scope/RefactorScopeCommand.java -> This syncExec() runnable can only break if the code executing the command is not already running on the UI thread.

The problem is that the Transaction will have started on the presumed non-UI thread.  Then we synchronously transfer control to the UI thread to modify the model, which will fail with IllegalStateException because the UI thread doesn't have the open Transaction.

So, either (a) the contract of this command must simply be that it must be executed on the UI thread and the syncExec removed, or (b) the syncExec runnable must be wrapped in a PrivilegedRunnable so that it may "borrow" the active transaction from the background thread.

Line:77, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/scope/RefactorScopeCommand.java -> There is so much code already that does something like this that I'm pretty sure there's a UIUtil or some such API already available to get the active shell.

Would it be practical or useful to implement any of this refactoring service using the LTK framework?

Instead, it should just be added to the registry as the other services are added, above.  The registry will take care of starting the service.

Thanks for the review. 

I fixed simple issues but others are going to ask me more works, I think.

Yes, I began a test work but I didn't yet create the associated Gerrit review.

Thanks for your responses, Gabriel.  I have some more follow-up in in-line comments.
Line:63, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/AbstractRefactorCommand.java -> Yes, that should work.  There is even special support (I think) for OperationCanceledException to roll back in a more user-friendly way than other exceptions.

Line:264, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/command/RefactorModelResolverCommand.java -> OK, I see.  That makes sense because historical repository revisions are IStorages and they can participate in diffs and merges.  But not in refactorings (unless they happen to be IResources).  But, using URI or Resource consistently (for the overtly EMF-centric context of this refactoring infrastructure) would cover any potentially mutable resource, whether in the workspace or not.

I'd be interested in what others think of the use of IStorage.  I'm not strongly opposed to it if it helps the integration with EMF Compare.

Line:60, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorNotificationFilter.java -> OK, but any UML element can be moved and every kind of UML element can be referenced by something else (at least by a Comment).  So, every UML element must support refactoring, not just the elements contained in Resources and Packages.  What side-effects are you thinking of?

Notation views in the diagrams need to provide the same refactoring support.  Diagrams are referenced by shortcuts that need to be updated when diagrams are moved from one resource to another.  We do also have other views within diagrams that can be referenced by named styles, such as for diagram-to-diagram synchronization in UML-RT.  Moving a diagram from one resource to another also moves all of its contents.  Diagrams can be moved by the Control/Uncontrol commands.

Line:63, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/listener/RefactorNotificationFilter.java -> I think it may just be that the comment is misstated.  This code will be invoked for any Notification signalling a change within a Package, such as packagedElements being added or removed.

Also, since we are actually concerned with additions and removals of objects in *containment references*, some pre-filtering of the notification at this stage could avoid the creation of notification-match objects that we won't need.

But, anyways, as far as use cases are concerned:  just consider that we can drag a Class from a Package in one resource to a Package in another resource, or we can also drag a Class from a Class in one resource (where it is a nested class) to a Package or a Class or whatever in another resource.  We can also move attributes, operations, etc. from one class to another ...

Line:55, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/scope/RefactorScopeProvider.java -> That works, too!  :-)

Line:23, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/service/IRefactorParticipant.java -> I don't want to add work to your task, but I do think that if refactoring extensibility is important, it might be convenient for Papyrus extenders to be able to use the same LTK API that is already familiar in Eclipse.  But, if it's not a good fit, that's fine.  I just want to be sure that it is considered; it's not critical.

Line:48, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.refactor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/refactor/service/IRefactorResourceManager.java -> That's good.
