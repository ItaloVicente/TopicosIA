DESCRIPTION:

Bug 496307: [Profile Migration] Restrictive package pattern matching

- Add ProfilePackagePatterns to split package uris into the
package-identifying part and the versioning part. 
The package string is matched through a given Regex pattern.
The version information is matched through groups in the pattern and may
be spread across the URI. The format of the  resulting version string
can be customized using a dedicated MessageFormat.
- Add extension point for profile package patterns and version formats.
- Add pattern registry that is initialized with extension points.
- Add usage of profile package patterns when comparing URIs in the
zombie stereotypes descriptor, if there is no perfect equality. If no
registered pattern handles the URIs, the previous behavior is used as
default.

Includes tests for the pattern matching and splitting.
Includes tests to test reported behavior and improved behavior in the
zombie stereotypes descriptor.

This looks really great.  Clean code, well-thought abstractions in the API, thorough documentation and tests.  Thanks!  It's an excellent contribution.

I do have comments, though, about some naming that I don't like (alas, fairly pervasive) and some other quibbles about the details.
Line:5, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/plugin.xml -> See comment in the exsd file about the naming.

Line:6, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/schema/profilePackagePattern.exsd -> I would prefer the name "Profile Namespace URI Pattern".  Packages aren't names or strings or identifiers; we are properly addressing namespace URIs here.

Line:9, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/schema/profilePackagePattern.exsd -> namespace

Line:11, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePattern.java -> I don't think any of this needs to be API; the only API needed is the extension point.  Can this be an internal package?

Line:23, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePattern.java -> ProfileNamespaceURIPattern

Line:162, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePattern.java -> This is interesting.  We don't typically (which is to say, ever) do this in Papyrus.  Wouldn't this be better implemented as a test case in the JUnit tests?

Line:51, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternComparison.java -> Acronyms should be upper-case.

Line:60, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternComparison.java -> ditto

Line:100, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternComparison.java -> That's a curious looking operator!  ??

Line:102, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternMatchResult.java -> This is interesting.  It's not a namespace URI, because it has bits missing, but "package string" doesn't seem like the right name because it recalls the "package pattern" name that I don't like.

Ideas for an alternative:

* getMatchKey — suggests only that it's a unique identifier for a match
* getNamespaceKey — indicates that its a key for related namespace URIs
* getVersionlessNamespaceURI — a very literal-minded name
* getReducedNamespaceURI — more abstract, but sounds like a sauce recipe, and "reduce" has a special meaning for functional programming nerds

I would probably go with the first suggestion, but I welcome other ideas.  I could also be convinced to keep the name as it is.

Line:125, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternMatchResult.java -> I wonder whether it might be better to let the {1}, {2}, etc. substitutions in the format string match up with the numbering of groups in the regex?  Otherwise, it's a bit confusing at first reading an extension in the plugin.xml and seeing {0} that looks like the whole-match pseudo-group.

Line:32, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternRegistry.java -> Should be private.

Line:59, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternRegistry.java -> More thread-safe would be just to create the singleton in the INSTANCE field declaration.

Line:71, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternRegistry.java -> This shouldn't be a public method but should be the private constructor.

Line:23, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternUtil.java -> Why are all of these not (instance) methods of the registry?

Line:40, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternUtil.java -> Our coding standard has braces around this.  The Papyrus projects are all configured with formatting and clean-up profiles that would ensure this.

Same comment for more occurrences, below.

Line:447, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/internal/stereotypes/StereotypeRepairRegressionTest.java -> This statement should be in a finally block or an @After method to ensure that, if any prior assertion fails, it will be executed nonetheless.

Line:92, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternTest.java -> @return ?

Line:421, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternTest.java -> Should we really be able to unregister patterns that are declared in plugin.xml (static registrations)?  That seems surprising ...  Is there a specific use case for this capability?

Shouldn't the since be 1.2.1? or can this be included in 1.2.0?
Line:75, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/schema/profilePackagePattern.exsd -> probably 1.2.1 ?

Line:373, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/internal/stereotypes/StereotypeRepairRegressionTest.java -> I would prefer avoid using bug number in method name

Line:421, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternTest.java -> Martin already used a bunch of tricks to remove unwanted contribution in Information modeling. 
So having this kind of feature can be very useful to create custom product but should be banned from any "official" released plugins.

Line:75, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/schema/profilePackagePattern.exsd -> And not only that, but the bundle version in the manifest/pom needs to be bumped to 1.2.1 (or 1.2.100 if this is not intended to be cherry-picked to the neon maintenance branch).  Which version change propagates also up the containing feature chain.

Line:373, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/internal/stereotypes/StereotypeRepairRegressionTest.java -> Why?  It indicates in the test report the traceability to a bug.

Line:421, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternTest.java -> Then, this API really should be internal and the extension point documentation should indicate that clients should not rely on their extensions actually being in force.

But, in any case, it seems to me that it cannot be correct for any component that doesn't own a profile to remove these namespace-URI patterns that are registered by the profile's owner.  When would that ever do anything but break the model repair?

Let's just set the version to since 1.2.1 and move forward.
(Most of since are absent in extension point, or wasn't updated when renaming the plugin) 

@Martin: Thx for this great contribution
Line:373, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/internal/stereotypes/StereotypeRepairRegressionTest.java -> Let's keep it that way since it's doesn't really matter.

For the sake of arguing :)
A bug isn't a feature, is quit hard to read and don't stay true all the time. I would be ok to put an Id if it references a Requirement/Feature that are up to date.

Line:421, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternTest.java -> Let's say for example you want to make some dirty things with many version of a profile.

I don't know if it's required to be internal. I believe there is a common usage in eclipse foundation to never "hide" something. Ex : AdviceBinding should only be used for custom products.

Dear Christian and dear Benoit,

Thank you for your kind words and your in-depth reviews. It is really nice to see such an interesting discussion about the different aspects. The code is now adapted according to your feedback. 

Specifically, I agree that the naming was not perfect before and could have led to confusion. I therefore changed the name to 'ProfileNamespaceURIPattern' as suggested by Christian and also changed some method names. Furthermore, I aligned the message format indices with the indices of the pattern groups and bumped the version to 1.2.1 in the extension point, manifest and pom file.
Line:5, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/plugin.xml -> I agree and I have renamed the respective files.

Line:6, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/schema/profilePackagePattern.exsd -> I completely agree that the name 'Profile Namespace URI Pattern' is much closer to what the class actually provides. I therefore have renamed all related classes.

Line:9, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/schema/profilePackagePattern.exsd -> Done

Line:75, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/schema/profilePackagePattern.exsd -> As you have discussed, I have bumped the version up to 1.2.1 in the extension point, the MANIFEST and the POM file.

Line:75, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/schema/profilePackagePattern.exsd -> Done

Line:11, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePattern.java -> I see your point. I think it is ok for this to be an internal package, but I think it still should be exposed by the plugin to allow usage.

Line:23, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePattern.java -> Done

Line:162, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePattern.java -> Really? You never do this? Strange ;-) No, that is my bad. Of course, I only used it for internal testing and this should have never been pushed to Gerrit. Thanks for catching it!

Line:51, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternComparison.java -> Done

Line:60, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternComparison.java -> Done

Line:100, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternComparison.java -> It should have been an 'is equal?', but I replaced it with 'versus' to avoid confusion.

Line:102, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternMatchResult.java -> Yes, you are right, PackageString probably does not carry enough semantic of what you actually get. I thought quite a bit about this and selecting an option was a tough decision, but I ended up with the third option (VersionlessNamespaceURI). It is indeed very literal, but I think that is a good thing.

I also now expose the (matched) namespace URI, so this class exposes getNamespaceURI(), getVersionlessNamespaceURI() and getVersion(). I think using these three names it is quite clear what they provide and how they relate to each other. Hopefully, you can agree.

Line:125, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternMatchResult.java -> Really great idea! I have now aligned the version format with the pattern groups, i.e., index 0 in the format refers to group 0 in the pattern match. The result is more options in the formatting and on the other hand I think it is quite a natural alignment in this scenario. I have also adapted the comments and the documentation of the extension point accordingly.

Line:32, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternRegistry.java -> It is now public and initialized in the private constructor.

Line:59, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternRegistry.java -> I agree, I was using this style of singleton instance, because I saw it in another Papyrus class, but there is no benefit in using it like this here, I think.

Line:71, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternRegistry.java -> Done

Line:23, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternUtil.java -> Since I do not have a good answer for that, I moved them to the registry class. I now groups related functionality quite nicely, thanks!

Line:40, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternUtil.java -> Thanks, yes. I did not call the CleanUp before submitting it. It should be ok now.

Line:373, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/internal/stereotypes/StereotypeRepairRegressionTest.java -> Done

Line:373, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/internal/stereotypes/StereotypeRepairRegressionTest.java -> Done

Line:373, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/internal/stereotypes/StereotypeRepairRegressionTest.java -> I am also not used to writing bugs in the test names, especially since this information is already annotated. But I also do not see the harm and I included it in the name, because this is how the rest of the testcases in this class are written. So I just aimed for consistency.

Line:447, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/internal/stereotypes/StereotypeRepairRegressionTest.java -> I put it in a finally-block. Thanks for catching that!

Line:92, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternTest.java -> Absolutely correct, I fixed it.

Line:421, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternTest.java -> Done

Line:421, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternTest.java -> Done

Line:421, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternTest.java -> As Benoit said, I did some product customization for Papyrus Information Modeling and I noticed that sometimes it is quite useful to remove registered extensions.

Also, especially in the case of the namespace URI patterns, I think it is also a safety mechanism. Of course, we want the profile developers to be as precise as possible in their URI patterns. But it might be that someone provides a very generic pattern that matches far too many URIs and actually prevents the proper functioning of other patterns or the migration. In this case, some way to remove a pattern might be useful.

Therefore, unregistering is still part of the registry API. But it is definitely a good idea to also mention it in the documentation of the extension point.

Line:421, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternTest.java -> Done

Line:11, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePattern.java -> Oh, Yes, certainly.  Clients that want to take the risk are always free to do so with the restriction warnings!  That's Eclipse SOP.

Line:102, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternMatchResult.java -> Yes!  That actually makes it quite clear and complete.

Line:59, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternRegistry.java -> Yes, you will also see instances of the bizarre "singleton holder" inner class pattern here and there in Papyrus.

Line:421, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelrepair.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelrepair/packagepattern/ProfilePackagePatternTest.java -> Okay, I'm happy with the documentation.  Maybe an @noreference in the doc comment for the API Tools to signal a warning on usage of the API?  Just a thought; not required.

So long as it is clear to developers that when they remove another application's registration that they could be breaking that application for their users ...
