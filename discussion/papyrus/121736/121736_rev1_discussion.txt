DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533673: [Sequence Diagram] CombinedFragment should be created with
one InteractionOperand

Add an edit-helper advice to resize the default operand of a new
combined fragment to fill the available space in the combined
fragment.  As this needs to use the edit-part controlling the
operand's presentation to obtain a command that resizes the operand
and captures the interaction fragments within its bounds, the
execution of this advice command is deferred and captured back into
the original context for undo/redo.

The only question that I have is about bundle version numbers and how they may impact the @since tags, especially on the master branch.

Am I correct in assuming the the Oxygen.4 release will have version 2.2 for the junit.utils bundle and 5.0 for the uml.diagram.sequence bundle?  Because if so, then this the @since tags on the master branch will still be correct because they will appear to have been propagated from the Oxygen branch.  But if, for example, the uml.diagram.sequence bundle has some 4.x version in the Oxygen branch, then the @since tags in the master branch will be wrong because they also should be the same 4.x (because that will be when these APIs were added).

I agree with your reply. I have some doubts about the version in the MANIFEST. Oxygen and Master don't have same versions (that is not a problem) but the Oxygen got greater versions than Photon. I will check this with Papyrus team (maybe a merge had be forgotten?).

- Am I correct in assuming the the Oxygen.4 release will have version 2.2 for the junit.utils bundle and 5.0 for the uml.diagram.sequence bundle? True, there are not the only 2 bundles with greater versions than Oxygen.3.
