Patch Set 1:

The UnapplyAllStereotypes command (both of them!) is not useful because it isn't actually invoked for all elements being deleted.  So, I have deprecated it and discontinued its use in the two few where it was invoked.

Instead, this patch defines an advice that lets stereotype applications be proper deletion dependents of their base elements.

A regression test scenario is included that, without the fix, would fail on the assertion of the deletion of the stereotype applied to a dependent element (the dependency of which the deleted element is the sole supplier).  And, of course, I couldn't help but add some command-related utilities to the model-set fixture.

Line:22, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/edit/helpers/UMLBaseEditHelper.java -> I think the getDestroyElementCommand method that I deleted had actually been added to the generated code.  The same class in all other generated diagram editors is just an empty class declaration.  And when I re-generate the Sequence diagram from its GMFGen, the UMLBaseEditHelper remains empty:  my change isn't overridden.

(besides that the former implementation of getDestroyElementCommand forgot even to delete the element that was meant to be deleted, so it was completely broken.  It *only* unapplied the stereotypes!)

Indeed, the method wasn't generated at all (So it didn't required a @Generated NOT either)

So, ignore my comment, that's fine with me :)
