DESCRIPTION:

Bug 537571: [Sequence Diagram] Time Constraints and Observations

Implement the TimeConstraint for DestructionOccurrenceSpecifications.

Implement the TimeObservation for ExecutionSpecifications and
DestructionOccurrenceSpecifications.

Implement time observations and constraints on message ends,
on lifelines and on execution specifications, as well as on the
lifeline head for creation message timing.

Ensure accurate creation feed-back for time constraints and
observations with an oversized shadow figure for clarity.

JUnit test coverage for creation of time observations
and time constraints in the diagram.

> Uploaded patch set 5.

This rebases the patch onto the fix for selecting lifelines and things on lifelines, which being patched also on master (as unrelated to the time elements feature) should precede it and can be processed first.

(Note: obviously the +2 doesn't take the minor issues mentioned offline into account :) These minor issues don't prevent from merging this (But apparently, since it's a draft, I can't do it))
