DESCRIPTION:

Bug 537571: [Sequence Diagram] Time Constraints and Observations

Implement the TimeConstraint for DestructionOccurrenceSpecifications.

Implement the TimeObservation for ExecutionSpecifications and
DestructionOccurrenceSpecifications.

Implement time observations and constraints on message ends,
on lifelines and on execution specifications, as well as on the
lifeline head for creation message timing.

Ensure accurate creation feed-back for time constraints and
observations with an oversized shadow figure for clarity.

JUnit test coverage for creation of time observations
and time constraints in the diagram.

> Uploaded patch set 3.

This updates the review for
* rebasing on the recent master rebase of the feature branch
* implementing creation feed-back for time elements, including some re-work of the existing locator logic to support this new feed-back and also dynamically accounting for the side of the lifeline at which a create message is attached
