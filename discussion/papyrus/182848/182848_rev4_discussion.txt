Line:103, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.toolsmiths/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/toolsmiths/preferences/CustomizationEditorActionKind.java -> We should probably add a check somewhere around here; to avoid prompting when the Properties Perspective and/or Preview view is already open

Line:28, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.toolsmiths/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/toolsmiths/query/ShowContextQuery.java -> Should we deprecate this class? (I would even remove it, but API Tools might disagree :) )

Line:103, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.toolsmiths/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/toolsmiths/preferences/CustomizationEditorActionKind.java -> Nah, better to badger the user into hitting the "Remember my decision" checkbox, I think 😉 

Seriously, though, agreed. If the customization perspective is open, there's no need to prompt. However, if the view is open but in a different perspective, I think the user should still be prompted because they may want to switch to the perspective. And this prompt should also include the show-the-view option because it is still useful to be able to hit the remember checkbox and then that button to make sure that the view will always be shown.

Line:28, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.toolsmiths/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/toolsmiths/query/ShowContextQuery.java -> Good point. I'll deprecate it. For better or worse, it's public API.
