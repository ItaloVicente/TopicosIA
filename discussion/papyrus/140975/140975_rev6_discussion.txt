DESCRIPTION:

Draft : new implementation of MultiPageEditorSite
	- code not yet cleaned
	- quite near to work, but a patch is required to Eclipse Platform to override org.eclipse.ui.part.MultiPageEditorPart.createContainer(Composite)
		- but my solution seems very dirty, we probably need to rewrite fully the shah container,...
	- but works and compliante with Eclipse pre-existing classes

This class doesn't compile.
The main problem is the constructor : Papyrus uses a IEditorSite instead of a MultiPageEditorPart in its argument...

In fact the IEditorSite is associated to org.eclipse.papyrus.editor.PapyrusMultiDiagramEditor... Maybe ths class should be a MultiPageEditorPart and all will be ok?!?!
