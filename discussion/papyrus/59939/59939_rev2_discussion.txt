DESCRIPTION:

Bug 481302: [Profile] when reapply profile you can lose information
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=481302

Work around the missing "foreign definitions" reference from a dynamic profile definition to a static definition that it extends. In the Papyrus implementation of the stereotype-application copier, look up UML definitions of Ecore elements in the implicitly referenced "foreign definitions" when not found by the default UML implementation.  This provides for compatibility with dynamic profiles already deployed that are missing this annotation (even if an eventual fix for bug 481712 adds them to profile definitions in the future).

Includes regression tests for:

* dynamic profile extending a dynamic profile (control case)
* dynamic profile extending a static profile, using Papyrus algorithm
* dynamic profile extending a static profile, using UML2 algorithm (annotated as a failing test)
