DESCRIPTION:

Bug 496439: [RSA Import] Give mapping traces to extension transformations https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=496439

(cherry-picked from master)

Carry mapping traces forward from each transformation in the chain to the next.  Provide a black-box library with custom operations that query the mapping traces to find sources for generated outputs because the standard invresolve and invresolveone operations only inspect the traces of the current transformation, not any previous.

Provide also a new API for execution of a transformation that automatically includes the traces, so that extensions can make use of them, too (otherwise, as currently in Papyrus-RT, they will always have to reimplement access to the executor pool, which is a detail that should be abstracted away from them).
