DESCRIPTION:

Bug 433206: Papyrus shall enable local synchronization between graphical element and element in the model
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=433206

Synchronization support for sequence diagram (results would look better with an
effective auto-layout management for the diagram).

Patch Set 1:

This change adds minimal support to the Sequence Diagram for synchronization.  The results don't look great:  in a few uncomplicated tests, without CombinedFragments, all of the shapes and messages that I expect to see appear, but mostly piled on top of one another (except that lifelines are properly laid out horizontally).  This is where an auto-layout implementation for the diagram will be needed.  But, at least, this allows the user to tease apart the tangle and produce some kind of a diagram.

A few tweaks were needed in the diagram implementation to make execution specifications appear at all (they were not created on the lifelines that they are supposed to cover, so they were immediately deleted again).

Ad hoc testing suggests that the normal use cases of drawing a sequence diagram are unaffected by these changes.  4 errors and 17 failures in the Sequence Diagram Tests are the same as have been reported by the last several Hudson builds; they are regressions caused by some other changes.
