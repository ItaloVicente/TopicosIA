Automatic merge of the Toolsmiths feature branch into the master branch.

There is a test failure in the ProfilePluginValidationTest: the test asserts an exact number of problems, but there were later developments that now report an additional legitimate problem. This can be fixed later by making the assertions not over-specific: they should not assert the number of problems, only the specific existence or absence of problems that it tests.
