Thanks for following up on this, Patrick. I have some comments and questions in-line.
Line:5, plugins/emf/org.eclipse.papyrus.emf/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Good catch on the bundle metadata details, thanks!

A question about version updates: when are these supposed to be implemented? I was under the impression (quite possibly mistaken!) that there was a pass at the end of the release to update version numbers according to (a) what has changed in git and (b) what the API tooling says about new or changed APIs. Because otherwise it is difficult to coördinate amongst multiple contributors who might make the first change to a bundle in a release, and further when another contribution makes a change that requires a different kind of version increment.

And then, of course, there's the question of why increment this bundle's version only. I expect there are others that would need similar treatment. (I'm happy to track them down if needed)

Line:33, plugins/emf/org.eclipse.papyrus.emf/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/emf/helpers/BundleResourceURIHelper.java -> What is this URI? Looks like an accidental paste.
