Very good initiative on cleaning all features descriptions

Important point
 - add a warning in the description of the feature that shouldn't be installed (ex : all.extra, build....)
 - some missing description
 - wrong description for validation (IMHO)

Other:
 - always use P for Papyrus :)
 - I fear that description should be in feature.properties and referenced with for example %featureDescription
(We may wan to use a french description in the future)
 - in the same idea the top of the feature should looks like 
Ex: 
<feature
      id=""
      label="%featureName"
      version="" provider-name="">
