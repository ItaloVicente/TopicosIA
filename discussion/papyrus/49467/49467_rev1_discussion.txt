The tests are green again and the drop seems to work as expected, but I'd like another committer to review the contribution

solution is clearly not ideal, but for me it seems to be general consequence from ElementType's tramsition.
in particular for diagrams where semantic and graphical structure is different, the information about graphical structure should be somehow passed to the element types.
This is why in general the helpers for ActivityD are more difficult than for other diagrams, and thats why here we have to introduce not elegant ActivityNodeHelper.OUT_FROM_PARTITION
Alternative solution would be to create the command to clear inPartition straight from the Policy, but it seems to be against the general idea of types/ helpers

Also we need to consider the 'Bug 467324 - [Activity Diagram] Unrelated InPartition should be preserved on drag-drop between two partitions', which is also fixed by this change.

I think it makes sense to carry information about the "intention" in the Request. It is not sufficient to know "What" is moved "Where", we also need to know "How", and "From where" (Because a semantic drop in the ModelExplorer doesn't necessarily mean the same thing than the same drop in the Diagram)

Agreed, we need to keep this as flexible as possible

Excellent! Indeed this works fine now, even with nodes 'contained' in multiple groups
