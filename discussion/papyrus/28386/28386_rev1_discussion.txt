DESCRIPTION:

437052: [CDO] Support resource modification tracking for non-CDO resources
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=437052

Restore the resource modification-tracking-based strategy in the ModelSet's save logic.  IModel implementations delegate the question of whether a resource needs to be saved to the ModelSet via a new "shouldSave(Resource) : boolean" API.

The ModelSet, in turn, delegates the question of whether a resource needs to be saved to its ProxyModificationTrackingAdapter, which latter is now specialized by the CDOAwareModelSet to take into account the save semantics of CDOResources.  For a ModelSet that is not tracking resource modifications, and therefore does not have this adapter, it simply assumes that any resource that can be saved needs to be saved.

Patch Set 1:

This patch set re-enables the ModelSet's resource-modification tracking in the CDO Integration layer, thereby letting the IModels depend on it to determine which resources to save.

So, now the IModels, when asked to save, check each Resource that they would save, whether it should be saved.  This query is delegated to the ModelSet which, in turn, delegates it to its ProxyModificationTrackingAdapter if it has one.  If not, we do as before, assuming that any resource that is writable (not read-only) needs to be saved.

The CDOAwareModelSet creates a specialized ProxyModificationTrackingAdapter that handles workspace resources as the base infrastructure does, but adds handling of CDOResources.  In the CDO case, a resource needs to be saved if its transaction is dirty, as CDOResources implement save semantics as transaction commit.

New JUnit tests cover a couple of non-complicated scenarios involving workspace resources, both with and without the CDO Integration layer installed.
