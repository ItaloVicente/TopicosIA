Patch Set 1:

I simulated a long rendering time and tried several solutions:

- Run in an Eclipse runtime job ==> SWT exception because DiagramRenderUtil.renderToSWTImage can only be run in a UI thread
- Display.(a)sync ==> UI stuck
- Run in a UI thread ==> UI stuck
- Set installed on surface to true for the edit policy, and let it do its stuff ==> The edit policy runs the popup instructions in its own UI thread and the UI still gets stuck

To compromise between functionality and performance, I now only render the preview image once. It means that even if the target diagram is updated, the preview isn't updated until the source diagram is reloaded (e.g. close then open).

Any better idea?

Btw, the referenced bug was fixed in the previous patch so I guess we should create a new bug if we want to continue working on the issue discussed here.

Sounds good (That was already the previous behavior, since the image was rendered only once, when the diagram was opened)

To go further (But this patch is OK for me already), you can add a (recursive) listener to the target diagram, and dispose the image if something changes. So, the image would be computed once every time the target diagram is changed, but lazily (i.e. only computed if the user hovers the shortcut)

Another improvement to avoid undesired freezes would be to compute the new image only if the user hovers the shortcut (without moving) for more than 200ms (So the diagram wouldn't freeze if the user accidentally hovers the shortcut). Just like standard tooltips.
