  - ensure that we only try to run the save runnable in the workbench window if on the UI thread
----
[1e65796] 399859: [Profile Applications] Papyrus shall enable to manage profile applications in separate files

Only prompt the user about save requirement if the control action was UI-initiated. Duh.
----

Initial support for refactoring of currently loaded and unloaded decorator models that apply profiles directly or indirectly to the packages being controlled.

----
[16a0884] 399859: [Profiles] Papyrus shall enable to manage profile applications in separate files

Enable storage of profile applications in UML resources anywhere in the workspace, even in different projects than the models to which they are applied.  Uses a new workspace-wide index of cross references between profile-application resources and user model resources, built at start-up and maintained in the background as the workspace changes.

Hide profile application models in the Model Explorer by default.
----

Patch Set 1:

So, yes, this is a large Gerrit patch set (too large, it seems, for Mylyn to display).  I’m not sure how we want to proceed with review, but I think we should integrate this for M3.  At least it is mostly addition of new files!  ;-)
