DESCRIPTION:

444227: Property view broken for associations
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=444227

The ViewEditor must be able to repeat sections for list values, such as the multiple ends of an association.  To that end, the DisplayEngine now supports proxy sections that combine the same section instance that needs to be repeated with an arbitrary discriminator that distinguishes the repeated occurrences.  This allows the display engine to reuse controls for the same repetition of the same section.

Also, because multiple selections are presented as observables that are dynamic proxies wrapping a MultipleObservableValue, the ViewEditor cannot rely on that class's API to access the multiple objects that were selected.  The API required by the ViewEditor is factored out into an interface that the proxy then automatically implements, as usual in the delegating observables mechanism.

Aha!  I managed to hack the scrolled pane employed by the Properties view to force it to adapt to the new client-area size implied by the changed layout of a ViewEditor (such as for association member ends) when sections are added and removed.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

I still have refresh issues when switching from a binary association to a ternary, but if I select the ternary association first (Then switch to Binary -> Ternary), everything is properly refreshed

There has always been issues with dynamic refresh in the properties view, probably because we don't use "extended" sections ("canUseExtraSpace=true"). Plus, the behavior of the refresh/layout is different depending on whether the section is drawn in the Eclipse properties View or embedded in a custom dialog/composite.

This is a minor issue however, and can be easily worked around by users, so that's fine for now.
