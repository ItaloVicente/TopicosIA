DESCRIPTION:

444227: Property view broken for associations
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=444227

The ViewEditor must be able to repeat sections for list values, such as the multiple ends of an association.  To that end, the DisplayEngine now supports proxy sections that combine the same section instance that needs to be repeated with an arbitrary discriminator that distinguishes the repeated occurrences.  This allows the display engine to reuse controls for the same repetition of the same section.

Also, because multiple selections are presented as observables that are dynamic proxies wrapping a MultipleObservableValue, the ViewEditor cannot rely on that class's API to access the multiple objects that were selected.  The API required by the ViewEditor is factored out into an interface that the proxy then automatically implements, as usual in the delegating observables mechanism.

Patch Set 1:

The fix for reuse of the ViewEditor (implementing nested property sections) for reuse of the property-sheet controls for Gradients in the Appearance tab regressed the behaviour of the property sheet for associations.

The association properties relied on the ViewEditor creating a DefaultDisplayEngine that allowed duplication of sections, because it presents a list of ends as a repetition of the same section.  However, the repetition of the same section defeats the ability to reuse the section's controls for changes in selection, so the previous fix (for gradients) changed to use a display engine that doesn't allow duplicates.

WIth this fix, the ViewEditor's display engine still doesn't allow duplicates, but it uses proxies for sections that combine the identity of a Section with an arbitrary discriminator value to present the same section multiple times to the display engine as apparently distinct sections.  Thus, the controls for any particular section may be repeated as many times as necessary but also reused when the selection changes to another selection that needs repeated sections.

In addition, testing around single and multiple selections of gradients and associations found exceptions in the log and/or error labels in the properties when:

  * selecting multiple elements that present ViewEditor in the properties, the ViewEditor
    couldn't unwrap a multiple selection's selected elements because the observables now
    are dynamic proxies and the MultipleObservableValue type is a class, not an interface
    that a proxy class can implement.  This is fixed by extracting an IMultipleObservableValue
    interface
    
  * the asynchronous updating of read-only state of a property editor didn't account for the
    editor being disposed in the mean-time

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

- Switching from a 3-end associations to a binary association works fine
- Switching back to the 3-end association gives a strange result (The 3rd member end view is on the right column instead of being on the left, so there is a white area on the left)


- Switching directly from the binary association to a 3-end association doesn't work: there seems to be a refresh issue

Note that these issues may be windows-specific, since resizing the properties view forces the SWT refresh/layout and everything works fine (Except that the 3rd group is still in the wrong column, sometimes)
