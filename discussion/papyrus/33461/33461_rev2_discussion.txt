DESCRIPTION:

444227: Property view broken for associations
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=444227

The ViewEditor must be able to repeat sections for list values, such as the multiple ends of an association.  To that end, the DisplayEngine now supports proxy sections that combine the same section instance that needs to be repeated with an arbitrary discriminator that distinguishes the repeated occurrences.  This allows the display engine to reuse controls for the same repetition of the same section.

Also, because multiple selections are presented as observables that are dynamic proxies wrapping a MultipleObservableValue, the ViewEditor cannot rely on that class's API to access the multiple objects that were selected.  The API required by the ViewEditor is factored out into an interface that the proxy then automatically implements, as usual in the delegating observables mechanism.

Patch Set 2:

Patch set 2 updates the ViewEditor to better handle changes in the number of child sections that it presents.  The main problem was that it didn't account for the fact that it created every section in a parent composite dedicated to that section, which parent composite is a child of the ViewEditor's 'self' composite.

This is now fixed by patch 2.  On changing the selection between associations of different arities, additional Member End sections are now created in the correct place in the 2-column grid.  However, it requires some manual trigger to cause the layout to refresh to either eliminate whitespace left by sections that were removed or to make added sections actually visible.

For example, if you:

1. Select the diagram surface.
2. Select a binary association.  The UML tab shows both member ends correctly.
3. Select the diamond hub of a ternary association.  See two member ends updated
    for the new association but not the third end.
4. Now select one of the three arms of the ternary association.  This does not change
    which model element is selected in the Properties view, but now the Properties
    view updates its layout to show the new Member End section that was created at
    step 3.
5. Select a binary association again.  See now that the third Member End section was
    deleted, but the layout still has space for it, as indicated by the vertical scrollbar
    of the tab's content pane.
6. Select another binary association.  The two member ends are updated and the
    layout is updated to remove the unnecessary whitespace.
7. Select the ternary association again. Tweak the size of the Properties view ever
    so slightly.  See all three member ends presented correctly.
8. Select a binary association.  Tweak the Properties view size again.  See both
    ends of the association presented correctly without extra space in the layout,
    and only those two ends.
    
I have no idea how to get the layout of the ViewEditor's overall 2-column composite grid to be recomputed immediately after child sections have been added or removed.  I've tried invoking the various different layout(...) methods of the 'self' composite, its parent, and whatever else I could think of, without result.  So, as it stands, this patch creates and/or destroys all of the correct section controls and ensures that they are correctly re-used when the selection changes, but I need somebody who understands SWT layouts better than I do to finish it off.  Otherwise, users will have to work around the layout issue to force layout updates as described above when working with n-ary associations.
