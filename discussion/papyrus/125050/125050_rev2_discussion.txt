DESCRIPTION:

Bug 507479: [SequenceDiagram] Choose lifelines covered by a combined fragment

Implement properties view for the InteractionFragment::covered
property of combined fragments and interaction operands. Restrict
the selection of covered lifelines to lifelines in the same interaction.

Add warning constraints for consistency of lifelines covered by
- interaction operand as compared to lifelines covered by the
  fragments that it owns
- combined fragment as compared to lifelines covered by fragments
  of its operands

Update the automatic validation (if the preference is set) of an
interaction operand that has has its owned fragments recomputed to
encompass the entire containing combined fragment, to handle the
impact on its lifeline coverage consistency constraint.

The UMLContentProvider filtering the Lifelines is incorrect; it also allows non-lifeline elements to be selected (e.g. the root model or top-level interaction). It should probably do super.isValidValue() && ...

Line:213, plugins/uml/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.properties/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/properties/modelelement/UMLModelElement.java -> Thanks for the comment.  I did only see lifelines as selectable leaf elements in the tree, so I thought the EClass constraint was implemented separately, but I'll have another look into the code.  Most probably including the super condition would be appropriate anyways.

Looking at this again, I am not sure that I should make the requested change.  Adding the super.isValidValue condition fails the JUnit tests, although the UI does still work.  And the reason why the JUnit test fails is that a naive client can no longer drill down through the container chain to reach valid values.

The current (patch set 2) implementation is in accordance with the pre-existing case for
the valid values of signatures for Messages, which didn't previously check the super
condition.  The content provider supplied to the UMLModelElement works in the UI
(reference editor dialog) as written because of content-provider wrapping.
ServiceEditFilteredContentProvider has a validator that further checks objects for
isValidValue() by attempting to obtain an executable edit-command to set the
property.   This weeds out things that are not lifelines.

Weird... I was definitely able to add non-lifelines to the Covered reference, causing tons of EMF Exceptions which ultimately resulted in an empty "covered" reference. Adding the super.isValidValue seemed to work (And I don't see any test failure with that change either)

I don't really understand this comment. Is there actually a test for the properties view part? I didn't see it (Unless it's a test from a different bundle, not related to the Sequence Diagram?)

That's so odd.  For me, the reference dialog editor only shows the lifelines, not anything else within the interaction.  However, I just did realize that my implementation (so far) lets me choose the interaction containing a a lifeline, or the classifier containing that, or the package containing that, ... which of course doesn't work for a feature of Lifeline type.

Perhaps it is these containing elements that you mean by "non-lifelines"?  Not things like messages, message ends, execution specifications?

I think I won't need the super call if I remove the erroneous ancestor condition.

No, this patch adds a unit test for the UMLModelElement class, and that test fails if I add the super call.

Yes, exactly :)

Oh! I didn't see that class, and only ran the Sequence Diagram tests. Now I can reproduce the test failure.

So now we agree on the observed behavior! :)

So if I understand correctly (from your first comment today), the test now fails because the super.isValidValue() will also check for the edit service, which is not correctly setup in the test? Yet, we do expect the edit service to be checked in the properties view, we could argue that the test is wrong :) (Admittedly, only some advanced DSML-like use-cases would really need to check for the edit-service. The edit-service verification in ModelElements has been initially added to support some SysML constraints, where SysML was more restrictive than UML)

A different approach could be to override the UMLContentProvider rather than the UMLModelElement, similar to what was done for InstanceValueContentProvider, except that the _CoveredContentProvider would extend directly SemanticUMLContentProvider (Explicitly bypassing the ServiceEditFilteredContentProvider, so at least the test would be consistent with the real behavior - even if bypassing the ServiceEdit is not 100% satisfying)

Anyway... these are just some hints about the things to consider. It's easy to get lost in all Papyrus supported/partially supported/once-supported-but-now-broken customization features

So, just pick what makes sense & is easier and ignore the rest :)
