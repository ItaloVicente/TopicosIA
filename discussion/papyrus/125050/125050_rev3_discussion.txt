DESCRIPTION:

Bug 507479: [SequenceDiagram] Choose lifelines covered by a combined fragment

Implement properties view for the InteractionFragment::covered
property of combined fragments and interaction operands. Restrict
the selection of covered lifelines to lifelines in the same interaction.

Add warning constraints for consistency of lifelines covered by
- interaction operand as compared to lifelines covered by the
  fragments that it owns
- combined fragment as compared to lifelines covered by fragments
  of its operands

Update the automatic validation (if the preference is set) of an
interaction operand that has has its owned fragments recomputed to
encompass the entire containing combined fragment, to handle the
impact on its lifeline coverage consistency constraint.

Works fine for me. Tests for properties view were not required but thanks.
Can you change the plugin version of the new plugin please? (+Header of plugin.properties)
Line:11, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.properties.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The version of new plugin must be 1.0.0

Line:2, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.properties.tests/plugin.properties -> Add CEA LIST please

Line:12, tests/junit/plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.properties.tests/pom.xml -> 1.0.0 version
