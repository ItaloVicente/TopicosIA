DESCRIPTION:

Bug 478314: [Performance] ContainmentSubsetRemovalAdvice severely impairing performance of delete on big model subsets
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=478314

Delete the ContainmentSubsetRemovalAdvice, which is no longer necessary
since the UML2 API fixed the change-recorder-based undo/redo of
deletion of elements from containment supersets by making those
supersets actually respect containment semantics (which was bug
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=465214).

A new JUnit regression test is added as a canary to detect future
problems in this undo/redo scenario.
