DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533676: [Sequence Diagram] Validation should be triggered after creation of CombinedFragment or InteractionOperand

Add custom well-formedness rules to check that messages and
execution specifications do not cross interaction operand boundaries.

Ensure that re-sizing of an interaction operand triggers validation of
that operand and the interaction fragments that it contains, plus any
messages originating or terminating within it.  Because the default
operand of a new combined fragment is now resized upon creation,
a new operand is likewise validated for its contents.

Fix validation hook and diagnostician extension point schema definitions
to match reality of the extension point implementations.
