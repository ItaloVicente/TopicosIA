DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533676: [Sequence Diagram] Validation should be triggered after
creation of CombinedFragment or InteractionOperand

Add custom well-formedness rules to check that messages and
execution specifications do not cross interaction operand boundaries.

Ensure that re-sizing of an interaction operand triggers validation of
that operand and the interaction fragments that it contains, plus any
messages originating or terminating within it.  Because the default
operand of a new combined fragment is now resized upon creation,
a new operand is likewise validated for its contents.

Fix validation hook and diagnostician extension point schema definitions
to match reality of the extension point implementations.

Remove UI contributions for validation, to avoid workflow interrution.
Validation framework is still slow, but less intrusive for the user. A
preference may control the validation activation on user actions.

Update the failing compilation on gmfdiag.common.tests.

Add a preference to switch on or off the validation.

> Uploaded patch set 12.

This fixes a few additional problems with the new automatic validation of interaction operands in combined fragments:

- messages just accumulate problem markers with repeated validation of an operand because the ValidationTool doesn't know to remove existing problems in non-contained elements
- the OperandDiagnostician would actually validate twice any ExecutionSpecification that is owned by an operand that is validated
- eliminate unnecessary flushing of display events that slows down the validation

A vote to say that I think this patch is ready to be reviewed again, and to affirm that testing of my fix in progress for bug 533679 shows that it does also fix the missing problem markers for partially covered messages and execution specifications.
