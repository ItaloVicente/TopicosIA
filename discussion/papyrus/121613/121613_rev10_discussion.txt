DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533676: [Sequence Diagram] Validation should be triggered after
creation of CombinedFragment or InteractionOperand

Add custom well-formedness rules to check that messages and
execution specifications do not cross interaction operand boundaries.

Ensure that re-sizing of an interaction operand triggers validation of
that operand and the interaction fragments that it contains, plus any
messages originating or terminating within it.  Because the default
operand of a new combined fragment is now resized upon creation,
a new operand is likewise validated for its contents.

Fix validation hook and diagnostician extension point schema definitions
to match reality of the extension point implementations.

Remove UI contributions for validation, to avoid workflow interrution.
Validation framework is still slow, but less intrusive for the user. A
preference may control the validation activation on user actions.

Update the failing compilation on gmfdiag.common.tests

Add a preference to switch on or off the validation

One file is modified in this gerrit without any needed modification, please remove it from gerrit.
Else rest looks good to me.

Trying to get validation errors during the creation:

- I created two ExecutionSpecifications on two LifeLines with y delta and one AsyncMessage between end of first ExecutionSpecification and start of the second one. After, i created the CombinedFragment crossing the message

=> No validation error was throw


- Same with CombinedFragment crossing an ExecutionSpecification

=> No validation error was throw
Line:45, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/preferences/CustomDiagramPreferenceInitializer.java -> No modification on this file, please remove it from the gerrit.

Thanks, Nicolas, for looking at this.  I'll try to address your comments and also rebase to fix the merge conflict..
