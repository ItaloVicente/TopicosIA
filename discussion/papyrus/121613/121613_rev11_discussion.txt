DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533676: [Sequence Diagram] Validation should be triggered after
creation of CombinedFragment or InteractionOperand

Add custom well-formedness rules to check that messages and
execution specifications do not cross interaction operand boundaries.

Ensure that re-sizing of an interaction operand triggers validation of
that operand and the interaction fragments that it contains, plus any
messages originating or terminating within it.  Because the default
operand of a new combined fragment is now resized upon creation,
a new operand is likewise validated for its contents.

Fix validation hook and diagnostician extension point schema definitions
to match reality of the extension point implementations.

Remove UI contributions for validation, to avoid workflow interrution.
Validation framework is still slow, but less intrusive for the user. A
preference may control the validation activation on user actions.

Update the failing compilation on gmfdiag.common.tests.

Add a preference to switch on or off the validation.

This addresses the accidental change to the preference initializer class and also closes a loophole in which the validation of a partially covered execution specification didn't happen.  In the latter case, if the execution itself wasn't picked up by an interaction operand but either its starting or its finish occurrence was, then the validation of the operand didn't check the execution specification.

The problem of creating a new combined fragment not actually reporting problems of partial inclusion of messages and execution specifications is, I would suggest, orthogonal to the purpose of this bug.  This bug is meant to address the triggering of validation, which does happen on creation of a combined fragment (the operand guard is always in error!).  The reason why these specific problems of partial coverage are not reported is because the operand, upon its creation, is currently not picking up any interaction fragments in the case of partial coverage.  I think that is better addressed with bug 530201, in which I currently have in progress some a fix to the detection of covered execution specifications (currently, the diagram never transfers ownership of an execution to the operand even if it is fully covered).

Once a combined fragment is created that partially covers a message or execution specification, if you nudge its size just a bit to trigger re-calculation of its owned interaction fragments, you'll see the validation kick in and report those problems.

Oops, sorry, I'm working on this in bug 533679, not 530201.
