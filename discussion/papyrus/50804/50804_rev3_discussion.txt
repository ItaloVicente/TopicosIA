I see many new @FailingTests. Why are they required?
Line:104, tests/junit/plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.clazz.tests/test/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/clazz/test/canonical/TestClassDiagramChildNode.java -> This test currently works on Mars and Master. Why is it required to annotate it now?

> I see many new @FailingTests. Why are they required?

OK, from offline discussion we agreed to annotate the new failures as @FailingTests, then fix them in a later commit (https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/50927/). I misunderstood that 'current' tests had to be annotated, rather than new ones.

In general, existing tests should never be annotated, because this hides a regression. New tests 'may' be annotated because they only highlight an issue which was not detected previously (= this is not a regression).

In this case, we're somewhere between both cases: since a single @Test tests many things, this is neither a regression nor a new test. So in this case, I think @FailingTest is OK as long as it fixed quickly (Which is done in Gerrit 50927). However, such annotations should *always* be properly documented to avoid confusion and so that we have a chance to actually understand and fix the issue later

Gerrit https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/50927/ only fixes the ClassDiagram. Let's wait for similar fixes on UseCase and ActivityD before submitting this (To avoid disabling some tests)
