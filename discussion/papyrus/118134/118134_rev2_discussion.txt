DESCRIPTION:

Bug 528199 - [Xtext, Constraints] The edition of constraints does not choose a suitable editor

- If no editor with for a given language is found, search all editors without taking language tag into account (implementations must still be compatible with semantic element). This assures that other editors are used, if the default editor is not compatible (e.g. OCL is default editor for opaque expression, but not compatible with non-OCL bodies). Without the patch, a standard editor is used in this case.

- Add OCL editor constraint also to opaque expressions
