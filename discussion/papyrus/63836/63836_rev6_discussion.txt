As elaborated in comments in-line, I think there's a lot more change here than is necessary or useful.  I'll be happy to be convinced otherwise, as I don't know what the motivation is for these changes.  :-)
Line:5, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.validation/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> It looks odd to have a test bundle that would never be deployed in a user installation being a friend.  I think it would be better just to tweak the classpath visibility rules within the test project to suppress the restriction warnings.

Line:34, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.validation/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/validation/commands/AsyncValidateSubtreeCommand.java -> (similar comment for the other commands)

Do we actually need this convenience constructor, or would it be better to require clients to be explicit about the diagnostician that they wish to use?

Line:29, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.service.validation/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/service/validation/handler/SelectAndValidateModelHandler.java -> (and in other related commands)

Since we're changing this, anyways, we can use the

     GMFtoEMFCommandWrapper::wrap(ICommand)

method instead of the constructor to handle non-dirtying commands (which I think these validation commands should be).

File Comment: plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.service.validation/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/services/validation/commands/UMLAsyncValidateSubtreeCommand.java -> (and for other related commands)

Do we really need to define a whole suite of UML-specific subclasses?  Why not just have the UI actions that create these commands inject the UMLDiagnostician into the core validation commands?

(I won't ask why the appropriate diagnostician can't be determined automatically from a registry based on the kind of model being validated; that's out of scope of this change set)
Line:277, plugins/uml/textedit/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.textedit.constraintwithessentialocl.xtext/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/textedit/constraintwithessentialocl/xtext/EssentialOCLEditorConfiguration.java -> This is exactly the kind of change that I think we don't need, to use the UML-specific subclasses that we don't need to have.

Line:368, plugins/uml/textedit/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.textedit.stereotypeproperty.xtext.ui/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/textedit/stereotypeproperty/xtext/ui/contributions/StereotypePropertyEditorConfigurationContribution.java -> We're refactoring commented-out code.  Should this code be activated?  Why is it commented out?  If it isn't required, it should be deleted.

Line:148, tests/junit/extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/cdo/internal/ui/markers/tests/ModelValidationMarkersTest.java -> Again, this seems like more convenience than we need.  I think it's better to make the client choose a diagnostician explicitly, or else have the diagnostician discovered from a registry.  The EcoreDiagnostician is never the right choice (only for these tests or in an actual graphical Ecore editor).

Hi Christian,

thanks for the quick review. The idea of the patch is that the API user should not have to select a diagnostician which would require us to make the diagnostician visible (and thus limit the options for eventually changing the implementation in the future). But the diagnostician was in fact referenced from more places than I expected. Thus, I'm not sure any more, if we shouldn't keep the diagnosticians (ECore and UML) visible and just limit the visibility of the two validation adapters.

Right, good idea to hide those adapters.  But, there's otherwise we're just trading the client's selection of a specific diagnostician for the selection of a specific command.  If we really want to hide the detail of which diagnostician should be used, I think registering a diagnostician against the language of the model for automatic discovery would be the way to go.  The Language Service can provide the languages instantiated in the model-set, against which we would look up the diagnostician(s) to use (note that there could be multiple languages, so maybe a composite diagnostician is in order?)
