DESCRIPTION:

Bug 464647: [Synchronization] Generate JUnit tests for diagram view synchronization
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=464647

Adaptation of initial prototype of a Papyrus Tests Generation framework to add
diagram synchronization tests.

Changes by Christian W. Damus <give.a.damus@gmail.com>:

Rebase onto latest Mars post M6 master branch.

Fix .ignores: ensure that only contents of xtend-gen/ folders are ignored,
not the folders themselves

Convert Xtend codegen templates to UTF-8 encoding

Update the QVTo transformation to support the statically generated
UTP profile.  This requires:

- invoking the UMLResourcesUtil API for stand-alone set-up
- updating the profile-registration workflow component to support
   the registration of a statically generated profile
- updating the QVTo transformation to ensure that applicable
   stereotypes are resolved in the proper ResourceSet context to
   avoid losing all applied stereotypes in the generated test model.
   This, in turn, requires a Java black box to handle the EMF-specific
   concerns of resource-set context that QVTo is not aware of

Fix build.properties files to include all sources and POMs to generate
sources in xtend-gen/ folder.

Fix compilation problems in the integration of the generated tests into
the master suite bundle.  Update the Tycho build to include the test generation
framework bundle.  Update the build and Oomph setup to include the UPR profile
bundle dependency and the Papyrus Developer tools dependency.

Fix numerous codegen problems:

- base model does not reflect correct package name for palette tests
- inject replaceable templates instead of making them all static
- add generation of import statements in suites
- fix references to test constants interface
- fix references to diagram creation command

Fix remaining compilation errors in Use Case tests:

- look up the DiagramUpdater class to compute correct import
- factor out creation of generated files into an utility extension
- factor out generation of the copyright header comment
- add some imports to templates that were missing them

Refactor Xtend codegen templates to:

- improve management of imports
- improve names of AllXyzTestsGen suite classes
- don't generate test classes that have no test cases
- share common code to simplify the specific test case templates

Fix more code generation problems:

* missing package imports for required edit-part classes
* invalid package imports (non-existent edit-part classes)
* non-conformant names of diagram creation command and test constants interface.
  This introduces new attributes to test classes in the model, of String type,
  specifying the relevant type names.  The defaults are computed by the QVTo
  transformation but may be overridden (hard-coded) by a diagram test's bundle's
  specific QVTo to provide custom names

Regenerate all diagram test bundles that have UTP test models.  Some
changes had to be applied after the fact to fix up problems, as follows:

  Sequence Diagram:
  * the UMLDiagramUpdater class doesn't have a static INSTANCE field
    (this diagram hasn't been regenerated from the Mars version of the
    diagram codegen templates)

Add generated tests for Communication Diagram.

Fixed workflow infrastructure to support all-tests generation.

Use URI mappings to eliminate the need to copy and delete the
framework's QVTo files.

Add an infrastructure for generation of diagram synchronization tests.
This includes

* new abstract test classes in the oep.uml.diagram.tests bundle
* updates to the framework UML model to capture the new base test classes
* new QVTo transformation to generate synchronization tests in the UTP model
* new Xtend template to generate synchronization tests from the UTP

Generated initial synchronization tests for the Use Case Diagram as an
example.

Fixed various small problems:

* unwanted newlines in some test method bodies
* fully-qualified references to UMLTypes class in synchronization tests
* missing commas in QVTo scripts that cause edit-part names to be concatenated
* (a biggie, actually) fix the all-tests generation to avoid repeating all
  previous transformations at each step

Translate QVTo transformation steps to Xtend:

Xtend exposes list values in UML models in their native EList terms, which affords stable and predictable ordering of transformation operations and, hence, test model structure and generated code.  It also provides for more concise, debuggable, searchable, and performant transformations with better Java integration.

Assign predictable, stable XMI identifiers to elements of generated UML models to avoid
unnecessary diffs in source control when re-generating.

Regenerate code from the Xtend version of the framework. Git-ignore the generated UTP
source models because they reference and depend on UML instance models of the GMFGens
that are already git-ignored, so there's no point in having these in git.  Besides that
they are now much larger because of the generated unique XMI IDs.

Patch Set 2:

Xtend generates code that uses Java 1.6-style annotations, so patch set 2 updates the test plug-ins' classpaths accordingly.
