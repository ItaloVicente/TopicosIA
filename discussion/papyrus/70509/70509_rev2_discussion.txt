DESCRIPTION:

Bug 491542: [All Diagrams] Undo doesn't work with RuntimeValuesAdvice
dialog for creation
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=491542

Support re-entrant command execution in the CheckedOperationHistory,
which is used by both the CheckedDiagramCommandStack (used by the
diagrams) and the NestingNotifyingWorkspaceCommandStack (used by
everything else), in much the same way as the latter supports
nested execution.  This ensures that, in the case where the execution
of a top-level operation in the diagram triggers nested execution of
operations in the EMF editing domain, which both delegate to the same
CheckedOperationHistory, the nested operations are executed strictly
within the context of the root operation, not separately as a sequence
of operations in the history.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Okay, so now that I've determined that, in fact, the exception that had me convinced this solution was a bad idea and that the RuntimeValuesAdvice is a bust was completely unrelated, I had another thought about a refinement needed in this patch.

Nested command executions, like any command that was added to a composite before execution, should propagate undo-contexts up to the top-level command.  This ensures that, because the overall command assuredly impacts that context, it will appear in the undo/redo history for that context.

Patch Set 2:

This new patch set adds JUnit tests that simulate the Papyrus-RT scenario involving the re-entrant command execution by the EditionDialog in the RuntimeValuesAdvice in a command executed on the diagram command-stack by a palette tool.

Without the fix in the CheckedOperationHistory, the test cases that verify undo on the EMF command-stack and on the operation history both fail because they find, as the user does in the Papyrus-RT scenario, that only the editing of some properties of the object created by the SemanticCreateCommand are undone.  The creation of the object, itself, is not undone and in fact is not on that view of the undo history (because it is missing the critical editing-domain context).

With these tests verifying the fix for the problem (and, in some degree, safety of the fix) and all the other diagram tests not showing regressions on the CheckedOperationHistory change, I'll be confident to merge this change.  I think it's important, otherwise advice commands like the RuntimeValuesAdvice will never be usable in the diagram editor.
