DESCRIPTION:

Bug 536378: [RCPTT] Sequence diagram functional test regressions

- remove test cases from the "suites" folder that were redundant
  with identically-named test cases in the "tests" folder
- us CSS to select Roboto 11pt font in all tests for consistent
  (in some degree) geometry across platforms
- define ECL procedures to express assertions of the geometry of
  shapes in the diagram more concisely and with tolerances for
  platform variability (and perhaps other sources of variability)
- update test assertions to reflect current layout results on
  Mac platform with the intention that tolerances account for
  deviation in Linux build environment
- update stylesheet for labels

Note that some of the layout results as asserted now in the tests
may be functionally incorrect and so not flagged as such by tests
that should be failing. These will have to be reviewed once the
noise of test failures for reasons of invalid test construction
(e.g. asserting fractional anchors to 10 decimal places!) have been
successfully cleaned up and stabilized.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

When testing it on Windows, i get some errors:

add007_AddOneMessageDelete
height was 337 but expected 317 ±5

add008_AddOneMessageFound
sourceAnchor y fraction was 117.0 but expected 120.0 ±2.0

move001_MoveMessageWithOthersMessages
y was 94 but expected 74 ±5

But i think it's preferable to commit this patch. I think we can't have the correct results on some platforms.
