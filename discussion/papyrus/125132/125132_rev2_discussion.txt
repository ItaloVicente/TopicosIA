DESCRIPTION:

Bug 536378: [RCPTT] Sequence diagram functional test regressions

- remove test cases from the "suites" folder that were redundant
  with identically-named test cases in the "tests" folder
- us CSS to select Roboto 11pt font in all tests for consistent
  (in some degree) geometry across platforms
- define ECL procedures to express assertions of the geometry of
  shapes in the diagram more concisely and with tolerances for
  platform variability (and perhaps other sources of variability)
- update test assertions to reflect current layout results on
  Mac platform with the intention that tolerances account for
  deviation in Linux build environment

Note that some of the layout results as asserted now in the tests
may be functionally incorrect and so not flagged as such by tests
that should be failing. These will have to be reviewed once the
noise of test failures for reasons of invalid test construction
(e.g. asserting fractional anchors to 10 decimal places!) have been
successfully cleaned up and stabilized.

> Uploaded patch set 2.

Addressed review comments:

- assertion failures now present useful messages like "sourceAnchor y fraction was 100.0 but expected 104.0 ±2.0"
- Roboto 11pt font is configured via CSS instead of the preferences

So I get a lot of failures (Above the tolerance threshold). I also get one failure that doesn't seem related to layout tolerance (At least not directly):

get-target-connection -path 1 | get-edit-part -text Message17 | activate-direct-edit
=> Incorrect selection request

Note that regarding layout, all tests should be executed @100% DPI (Which is probably not the default on your laptop?). Different DPI will result in much bigger layout differences (A different font rendering engine typically causes a +/- 2px difference; 125% DPI will be a 25% difference)

Fortunately, Bug 535519 is on good track and should solve these layout issues for good... But not yet :)

My failures (Linux/Ubuntu @100% DPI, which is not exactly like Jenkins, but close enough for these tolerances):

add005: y was 133 but expected 140 ±5
add006: y was 83 but expected 93 ±5
add007: height was 363 but expected 350 ±5
add008: sourceAnchor y fraction was 120.0 but expected 100.0 ±2.0

move001: Incorrect selection request.
move002: height was 843 but expected 930 ±5
move003: y was 143 but expected 153 ±5
move004: height was 763 but expected 770 ±5
Line:25, tests/functional/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence.functional.tests/contexts/workspaces/EmptyPapyrusModel_SeqDiagCreated.ctx -> Looks good :)

Hi Christian,
Bug 535519 has been closed, so you can now use the labelHeight: CSS property in your test model, to get fixed-size labels. That should help with getting platform-independent layout tests
