Hi Alain,

I already accepted the patch, since it fixes a critical bug.
But if it will significantly improve performance to check only non-navigable references, we should of course do so (this was the main reasons that I did not close the bug after the first patch - but then this caused confusions in bug 490791, so I set it immediately to resolved this time). I will make performance tests, if I find the time - but I won't mind if Christian or you volunteer to do so ;-)

I have no particular evidence, and in most case it probably won't be noticable, but reading the code for getInverseReferences(), it seems that only the non-navigable inverse references are actually cached.
Navigable inverse references are re-collected each time (involving dynamic allocation of ESetting and the like by code that does not seem so "light").
Moreover, all (cached) non-navigable references are copied into the returned list, so if there are many non-navigable references, this copy has a cost (this is probably not frequent, except maybe for predefined types that might get referenced a lot from many typed elements in big models).

In any case, the navigable inverses of only a single EObject will ever be scanned, so the cost is effectively constant (it doesn't scale with the model) unless that object has references to all objects in the model.  Which it won't.  I would rather keep the generality of getUsages(...) as currently implemented.  And who knows but that this query, reusable in more general cases, might not need to include a navigable reference in the future, unlikely as that may be?

In the absence of a demonstrable performance impact, this case should be considered closed.
