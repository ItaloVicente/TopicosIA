DESCRIPTION:

440197: The "Apply" action in "Repair Stereotypes" dialog doesn't work for the first click when more than 2 (incl. 2) profiles involved.
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=440197

Fix display of repairable applied stereotypes in diagrams.  This includes updating the responsible edit-part to schedule deletion of the stereotype visuals (or refreshing to pick up repair results) after the completion of the repair user interaction.

This deferral until repair is completed was actually broken:  deferred actions would be run prematurely in cases where repair loads additional UML resources that weren't previously loaded.  So, that is fixed in order to let the diagram properly defer treatment of broken stereotype visuals.

You're actually using a standard transaction (From TransactionHelper, not GMFUnsafe). Was that intended? I wonder what happens/what should happen for read-only diagrams. Since the stereotype compartments display are not "volatile", updating them certainly modifies the notation model. However, not updating them would result in invalid diagram display.

For example, what happens if you execute the model repair on a (writable) UML Model, for which some elements are displayed in a read-only notation model? I believe the user will be prompted to set the diagrams writable, which is fine if he accepts, but might lead to inconsistent diagram if he doesn't. And since the operation is executed in background, we should probably not have to ask anything to the user anyway.

Updating the diagram with an Unsafe transaction would apparently solve the issue (But it wouldn't be saved afterwards, so it'd just be cleaned up again the next time).

(Switching from +2 to +1 since I'm not completely convinced which kind of transaction should be used)

Yes, you're right.  I shouldn't have said "unprotected"; I meant "unstacked" (if that wasn't a thing, it is now: unstacked?).  The point is that it doesn't dirty the editor with an undoable operation in the history.

Good point.  We wouldn't want to bother the user with prompts in read-only resources for edits that the user didn't initiate.  So, I think, actually, the unprotected (really meaning that this time) transaction would be best.

Agreed.

Oh, it would be saved if the user subsequently makes the diagram writable (if, say, it's in a referenced model) to make other edits.  An unprotected transaction is as persistent as any other; it's just that it's allowed to run in an otherwise read-only context (from a Transaction API point of view).

I'll update to do the unprotected write.  Stay tuned.
