Nice to see this become a first-class service.
Line:31, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.validation/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/validation/IValidationService.java -> Why specifically an AbstractEMFOperation?  Why not more generally the ICommand interface from GMF?

Line:32, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.service.validation/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/service/validation/ValidationService.java -> I know it's distinguished by the package namespace, but to clearly distinguish this as a UML-specific variant of the same-named class in the infra plug-in, perhaps it should be named "UMLValidationService" or some such.

Line:74, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.service.validation/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/service/validation/ValidationService.java -> As long as we're providing commands that are exepected to be executed on the operation history/command stack, they should implement the INonDirtying interface if they don't modify the model (which these shouldn't!).  But, perhaps that should be another bug ...

Line:59, releng/org.eclipse.mdt.papyrus.releng.buckminster/papyrus-trunk-extra-nightly-tests/build.rmap -> How does this relate to fixing the Guava dependency problem?

The Guava issue is fixed in RC3, so this contribution is not critical anymore (Still useful, but it won't be integrated into Luna SR0)

One of my comments from https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/27815/ is still valid for this contribution:

> The ValidationService should probably use more generic interfaces for the returned commands (i.e. EMF Command, GMF ICommand or Eclipse IOperation). The validation commands don't need to be transactional, as they don't modify the model.

I agree that the returned type should be changed, maybe to ICommand
