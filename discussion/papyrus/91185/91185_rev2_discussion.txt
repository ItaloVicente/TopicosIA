DESCRIPTION:

Bug 511917 - [Model import] update the model import tool to produce a
Port_NameLabel view without an explicit set of element

* the toLabel() mapping that creates the DecorationNode PortNameLabel
inherits from toPapyrusNode mapping that inherits from toPapyrusNodeView
mapping that set the  
element : PortNameLabel should not in any case set the element, the
element is set in the Port_Shape view. for the inherited ports this
creates a conflict and did not display the label -->  create an abstract
mapping just like PapyrusConnectorLabel and ensure that we did not set
the element in this mapping. toLabel() inherits now the new mapping  

* add junit test to be sure that for all PortNameLabel View no element
was set (test only simple port, inherited port should be tested in
Papyrus RT not in Papyrus)
