This patch fixes the regression in the UML Architecture model tests. The problem is that the validation previously always searched the host install to find creation and conversion command classes, but then this was changed to search the JDT workspace classpath to account for the fact that during development, the command classes are in the workspace and not in the workbench installation that is developing them. However, this didn't account for the case where a deployed (installed) architecture model is validated, in which context it isn't in a Java source project but is actually in the installation and so needs to search for these classes in the installation.
