Hi Gabriel,

I assumed that you sent this review request to me with only new test cases because you were looking for suggestions how to fix the problem.  I've posted a patch with a proposed solution, which unfortunately makes API-incompatible changes to the listener implementation (though that should be OK because this API has never been released).  The patch basically lets the client supply the resource-set context for looking up profile metadata in the cases where it cannot be determined from a notification.

Apologies if I misunderstood the intent.

Hi Christian,

I tried to find a solution before to send you the request. To illustrate the missing case for adapter, I preferred to post unit tests that I used during my investigation. Your solution uses the same idea ( i.e. use the ResourceSet to resolve stereotype) that I didn't succeed to realize. I asked you to participate to this review because I wanted your lights.

The solution looks good for me ! +1

Thanks
