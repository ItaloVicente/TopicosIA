Hi, Gabriel,

I'm sorry to do this, but your static-profile use case and the work I'm doing on Decorator Models got me thinking.  Usually a bad sign, that.  ;-)

There are some more use cases that are more complicated:  loading and unloading resources that contain stereotype applications, separated from the model.  That's the gist of the Decorator Models feature on my committers/cdamus/external_stereotypes branch.  I've already had to make fixes in the PapyrusStereotypeListener to handle these stereotype-application resources, and StereotypeElementListener will have to handle the same scenarios if it is to supplant the PapyrusStereotypeListener.

So, stereotypes can be applied either when either (a) the base_Xyz reference is set or (b) a stereotype application that already has a base_Xyz reference is loaded from storage.  In the (b) case, there is never a notification that the base_Xyz reference is set; it already is set and always has been, as far as any listener can can tell.

My first thought was that the listener could respond to Notification.PROXY events on the base_Xyz reference and, when a resource is loaded, the listener could trigger resolution of all the base_Xyz proxies in the resource and let the resulting Notification.PROXY events be picked up later to generate the stereotype-applied events.  This is basically how I solved the problem in the PapyrusStereotypeListener on my Decorator Models branch.  But that doesn't work here because the StereotypeElementListener is a transactional listener, and when a resource is loaded without a transaction, the listener gets the events before the TransactionChangeRecorder has attached itself to the newly loaded objects and so it doesn't get the Notification.PROXY events and thus cannot forward them the listener.

Also, stereotypes can be unapplied when either (a) the base_Xyz reference is cleared or (b) a stereotype application is unloaded by the unloading of the resource that contains it.  In the (b) case, nothing will ever clears the base_Xyz reference, so we have to detect the unload.

As a result of all this, the filtering and notification-handling logic in the listener gets a lot more complicated.  I don't like it; it suggests that maybe a resource-set listener wasn't the best implementation, after all.

What do you think?

Hi Christian,

I looked your work on task 399859 which brings more complex use cases for listener. I think that the work on this listener must  manage all future use cases like external profile application. I agree too that listener is became too complex. When the role of a Class (here the listener) become so complex, I have tendency to think that something is bad.

My first thought about the problem of external resource for profile application, I believe that the ModelSet or a IPapryrusListener could play the role to notify StereotypeElementListener. In this case, the treatment on Resource's notifications will be delegated to ModelSet/IPapyrusListener. Like explained, I think IPapyrusListener could be used as Proxy listener and that resource's notifications manipulation mustn't be managed in this listener. IMHO, it is role of ModelSet/IPapyrusListener but it is maybe an optimistic thought.

Now, the next step is to know how to manage cleanly the external stereotype's resources. The final solution could either couple the solutions that work like explain above or make that current solution (without the magical manipulation of Resource's notifications of course) connects on your work about external stereotype resources ( specific listener,extension point ,... ). The real solution is maybe to separate issues.

Do you agree with a new unique solution or a relationship of solutions to solve each issue ?
