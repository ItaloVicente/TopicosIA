DESCRIPTION:

[Bug 453381, Bug 446572]: Label role in diagram UI: Regeneration of the UML statemachine diagram.
Note that since the generated code is not conform to the Papyrus formatting rules, I had to apply format/clean-up/organize-imports to the generated code to limit the number of diffs.
Note however that there are diff that are pure formatting diff,
because someone probably did not run the formatter after a previous generation.
Anyway, the only semantics differences in this contribution are:
-added LabelVisibilityPreference nodes in the gmfgen,
 as those nodes control both label roles and label preferences
 (the "role" part is still needed even if the "preferences" part is now managed via CSS).
 Apparently, this had never been done for the statemachine diagram before.
-In generated code, ILabelRoleProvider implementation has been generated as prescribed by the gmfgen
