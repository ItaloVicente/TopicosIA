DESCRIPTION:

Bug 534972 - [Designer] Code generation should not delete files prior to code generation

- New interface ICleanUntouched that can be implemented by a file-access class. It allows the
  selective deletion of elements that have not been touched by the generator
- Don't overwrite files with identical content.
- Add simple comparison class IOUtils (subset from org.apache.commons.io.IOUtils, importing is non-trivial)
- An additional patch for SW designer will be done in order to implement the desired functions
  based on new capabilities in infra.tools.file
