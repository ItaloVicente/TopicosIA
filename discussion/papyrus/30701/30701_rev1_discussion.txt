DESCRIPTION:

437217: [Editors] In-place reloading of model resources in the editors
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=437217

Implement deferral of the prompt to re-load until the editor is activated, in addition to the actual re-loading.  Also defer prompting and closing of editors for deleted resources until activation, for consistency and to avoid confusing dialogs that don't appear to have any effect or are inappropriate (esp. in Save All scenarios).

Patch Set 1:

Patch set 1 factors out all of the prompting to reload (for changed resources) or close (for deleted resources) editors from the ResourceUpdateService to a new DirtyPolicy API in the IReloadableEditor.  The "prompt the user" policy does the prompting, according to the nature of the resource changes, when the editor asks to resolve the dirty policy (in the case that it's actually dirty).  In the case of the Papyrus multi-diagram editor, the processing of a pending re-load (or close) request is done only when the editor is next activated, for whatever reason.

This fixes not only the problem of the Property sheet showing the wrong selection at the end of a weird interplay between focus lost, editor dirtying, and Save All (scenario discussed in bug 437217 comment 33) but also prompts to save editors that are being saved anyways by Save All (bug 437217 comment 13).

This patch set also improves the presentation of the prompt dialogs by using the sheet style on Mac, consistent with save prompts implemented by Eclipse Platform (such as when closing a dirty part).

Overall, I think this improves consistency and locality of user attention to dealing with issues pertaining to an editor only when the user expresses interest in that editor by activating it.  But, it does exacerbate the issue raised in bug 437217 comment 27 about the timing of refresh of editors that are visible because they are presented in a split pane.

I tested several combinations of these dimensions:

  * changing resources by saving other editors or deleting resources
  * while editors referencing those resources are dirty or not
  * while editors referencing those resources are the active editor or not
  * Save vs. Save All

Patch Set 1: Verified+1 Code-Review+2

I'm satisfied that this change addresses two distinct problems in in-place editor re-loading, besides making the behaviour more consistent with other Eclipse editors.  I'll +2 it and merge it so that it has time to soak over the next two weeks.
