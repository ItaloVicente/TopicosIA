Line:204, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.common/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/common/helper/PapyrusRoundedEditPartHelper.java -> Please explain. What is wrong with (1, 0)? Is (0, 0) better than (1, 0)?

Line:173, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.common/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/common/editpolicies/MaskManagedFloatingLabelEditPolicy.java -> Casting to View before checking instanceof is highly suspicious

Line:455, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.common/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/common/figure/node/RoundedCompartmentFigure.java -> What's specific with "-1"? What would happen if the color was "-2"? Or any other invalid value?

Line:363, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/widgets/layout/GridData.java -> Why/Were is this required? This seems suspicious

I will fix some of your comments, you can see my comments above.
Line:204, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.common/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/common/helper/PapyrusRoundedEditPartHelper.java -> the radius of the corner has no sense to be (10,0) so I don't set the figure with these values. More this creates a display bug on the shape. Perhaps it's better to patch directly the figure.

Line:173, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.common/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/common/editpolicies/MaskManagedFloatingLabelEditPolicy.java -> this is a issue, I've override a previous fix on that, my fault. Must be corrected.

Line:455, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.common/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/common/figure/node/RoundedCompartmentFigure.java -> -1 is for the default color, I don't try -2.

Line:363, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/widgets/layout/GridData.java -> there is only here that i can get the current Width information. If I don't get it I can't wrap content of papyrusRowLayout on property view witdth.

Line:204, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.common/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/common/helper/PapyrusRoundedEditPartHelper.java -> OK, I get it. (0, 1) or (1, 0) is actually equivalent to (0, 0). This should indeed be fixed in the figure directly. Avoid xor() since it's not obvious to understand why it is required.

if (width == 0 || height == 0){
	width = 0;
	height = 0;
}

Is much more natural

Line:455, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.common/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/common/figure/node/RoundedCompartmentFigure.java -> I suspect that many invalid values could cause exceptions here. If the color is neither known ("gred?"), nor a natural integer, you will manipulate null colors (In the best case), or even get exceptions

Line:363, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/widgets/layout/GridData.java -> OK this is still suspicious but let's go with this for now. We might find a better solution later. I'm not satisfied with current layout anyway
