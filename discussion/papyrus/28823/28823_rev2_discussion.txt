DESCRIPTION:

Bug 422532: Create Volatile stereotype

This fixes a problem where volatile was included in the EStorageClass
enum.  This does not match the C++ language spec and caused problems
(see Bugs 425594, 425597, and 425598) when the StorageClass stereotype
was applied to invalid language elements.

I've removed volatile from that enum and removed the extension from
StorageClass to Parameter and Property.  I've also introduced a new
Volatile stereotype and created new extensions that mirror the ones for
Const.

I've updated the code generator to use this stereotype in the same
places that Const is currently checked.  I also fixed a problem where
const (and now volatile) was generated for static member functions.

I've updated the TestCDTIntegration model but not the other ones yet.  I
would like to make sure this change is OK before making changes to the
other two test models.

When generating the profile I found that uml.ecore and types.ecore were
not found.  I've changed the C_Cpp.ecore file to use the platform: URIs
for these references but I'm not convinced that is the right solution.

I've also updated the namespace URI from /1 to /2.  This change was
needed to get existing models to reapply the profile.  I think that is
the expected method.

I seems that you defined the profile. Typically, I do not define a static profile, since this is somewhat redundant with the the actions done in the UML to ecore transformation.

Thus, I prefer to remove the definition from the UML file and keep the original URI ending with /1 - unless that causes problems with existing model (but I don't think that the volatile stereotype has been used so far)

I think we need to change the /1 because in my testing the Volatile wouldn't show up unless the profile was reapplied.  Changing the value to /2 caused a dialog to open at startup that had an option to reapply the profile.  After that point I could see the Volatile stereotype (and could not longer see StorageClass in invalid locations).

If there is another way to make the stereotype changes visible, then I would be in favour of that.  I just wasn't able to figure it out.

Also, could you describe your normal workflow a bit more?  I wasn't able to get the generator to work without first defining the profile.  I assumed that was the expected sequence.  Actually -- the editor nagged be about defining the profile on every save, so I eventually gave in.

I don't have a preference to any way in particular, this was just the only way I got it to work.  If you can describe your normal workflow then I can try that instead.

If the change in the profile is merely an addition, it is not necessary to migrate models that apply a static profile.

The procedure after a profile modification is to create an ecore from the UML profile: open the profile with the UML2 editor rather than Papyrus and invoke the convert-to-ecore option. Make sure that Camel-case-names is deactivated. Then, reload the genmodel and generate code from it.
