I have some concerns in the in-line comments on various files.  My most serious concern (actually a bunch of questions but the main reason for the -1) is in the comments on the NotationHashMap class.
Line:26, extraplugins/codegen/org.eclipse.papyrus.texteditor.modelexplorer/resources/TextEditorFacet.custom -> Does this mean that the facet customization will apply only to objects whose EClass explicitly extends EObject (either directly or indirectly)?  That is so rare (no sensible EClass extends EObject because EObject has no features) that I think it would never match anything.

Or, I don't understand how extendedMetaclass works (I'm assuming it works something like metaclass extensions in UML Profiles).

Line:25, extraplugins/codegen/org.eclipse.papyrus.texteditor.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/texteditor/modelexplorer/queries/IsTextEditorContainer.java -> Should put a deprecation notice in the Javadoc, too.

Line:26, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.modelexplorer/resources/PapyrusDiagram.custom -> Same comment as before.

Line:27, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/modelexplorer/queries/IsDiagramContainer.java -> Should put a deprecation notice in the Javadoc, too.

Line:26, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable.modelexplorer/resources/PapyrusTable.custom -> And again ...

Line:26, plugins/infra/nattable/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.nattable.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/nattable/modelexplorer/queries/IsTableContainer.java -> Javadoc

Line:50, plugins/uml/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelexplorer/queries/DisplayUMLStructuralFeature.java -> Don't need to add new fields to store values that are already static constants in the UMLPackage.Literals type.

e.g., UMLPackage.Literals.PACKAGE_IMPORT__IMPORTED_PACKAGE

Line:23, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/notationhash/ListenToEditingDomainChanges.java -> Class names should not be "independent clauses" comprising a transitive verb and an object.  In fact, this one is a complete sentence!  :-)

Line:29, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/notationhash/ManageHashMaps.java -> A class name that's a complete sentence.

Line:35, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/notationhash/ManageHashMaps.java -> Since you're calling it a function anyways, you may as well just use a Guava Function<EObject, EObject> and save the JVM having to load an ISemanticParent interface that's only used for this purpose.

:-)

Line:51, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/notationhash/ManageHashMaps.java -> Does this or any other of the access/modification APIs need to support concurrent access?  (since we're dealing with multiple different editing domains in this one object)

If so, consider using a ConcurrentHashMap.  Or, even, a Guava LoadingCache (with a CacheLoader that creates the NotationHashMaps based on the parent-function).

Line:35, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/notationhash/NotationHashMap.java -> A Guava Multimap (perhaps an ArrayListMultimap) would be a more transparent implementation:  easier to use and more obvious in what it does without sacrificing efficiency.

Line:92, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/notationhash/NotationHashMap.java -> It isn't clear to me that there can be only one source semantic object.  What if there are multiple source objects?  Wouldn't they all need hash updates?  And wouldn't they then each require their own 'need-update' flags?  How do we know that this 'source' is the one that needed the hash update?  Do we actually cache results for multiple source objects?

Line:108, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/notationhash/NotationHashMap.java -> That should be enforced by making the parent-function signature return type T.
