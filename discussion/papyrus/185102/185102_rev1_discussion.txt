LGTM! A very important improvement, indeed, and I'm not sure my comment is helpful so I'm satisfied with the patch as it is.
Line:202, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.model.xwt/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/model/xwt/resource/XWTResource.java -> If you're concerned about multiple threads contending on this, then perhaps it should be a ThreadLocal? This would allow concurrent threads working in different resources not to step on each other, but (a) is that a real scenario in Papyrus and (b) would it make a big difference to performance and (c) would we then have a problem of knowing when to dispose of a transformer for a thread that has finished?

Line:202, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.model.xwt/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/model/xwt/resource/XWTResource.java -> Initially I wanted to implement an ExecutorsPool similar to the one we have in org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.m2m.qvto.common, but that felt a bit overkill.

The ThreadLocal would be an option, but I feel it would introduce more issues, and wouldn't really help. I see typically 2 scenarios:

- Validation, happening in an arbitrary background thread (But always the same thread for a single validation pass). So we'd accumulate ThreadLocals
- In-editor edition, happening in the UI Thread (Always the same, so only 1 ThreadLocal for this case)

We just want to make sure that the Editor and the Validation don't try to run the executor at the same time, as it would crash. So, having a single synchronized executor is probably good enough. We don't really have cases where we *want to* run transformations in parallel (Where a proper ExecutorsPool would probably make sense)

Note: This patch depends on https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/papyrus/org.eclipse.papyrus/+/184418, which is still under review. It should be rebased once 184418 is merged
