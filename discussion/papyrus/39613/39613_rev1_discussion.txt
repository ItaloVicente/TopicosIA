DESCRIPTION:

Bug 456770: [UML RT] Papyrus shall support a protocol editor

1. Using resource set listener to create required protocol elements when
protocol container is created. 

2. Integrate protocol editor to UML-RT properties page so users do not
need to open new dialog. Create/modify/drag and drop also supported from
the properties page.

Users won't need to touch anything other than the protocol container.

Hi,

Good job! But your sadly work is not integrated in the Papyrus product.

You have to integrate the new plugin org.eclipse.papyrus.umlrt.ui : 
 - add your plugin to the feature (probably  org.eclipse.papyrus\features\papyrus-extra-features\org.eclipse.papyrus.extra.umlrt.feature)
 - create the pom.xml file for your plugin (the easiest way is to copy/paste it from oep.umlrt.properties plugin)
 - add reference to your plugin in the top-pom (org.eclipse.papyrus\releng\top-pom-extras.xml)

Hi Maggie,
The UI plugin was added by Remi. I just added new package "protocoleditor" to the plugin.

The org.eclipse.ui.startup extension point should be avoided. Plug-ins shouldn't be too greedy to start, given the time it takes.

The static selection service is not a good thing either. Selection should be retrieved in a context-specific way rather than statically

The properties view is already rebuilt each time the current selection is changed (For each Eclipse WorkbenchPart, i.e. the ModelExplorer's properties view is not rebuilt if the Diagram selection changes), so this selection listener shouldn't be needed at all

Thanks for the comment Camille. 
I am using custom property section for protocol editor. ( I am trying to figure out a way to avoid this but do not know yet). I think it is causing fair bit of pain for me. That's why I added the selection listener as well.
If the property view is always rebuilt when the selection is changed then as you said I do not need the selection listener at all. A section under tab is drawn if the containing tab is selected. So my protocol editor section never gets called until the UMLRealTime tab is selected. However workbench selection is wiped out when you select new tab in the properties view. Thus I do now know the element selected in the model explorer and I cannot build my page without context.

Hi,

Indeed the plugin is already present but only in streams/1.0maintenance
https://git.eclipse.org/c/papyrus/org.eclipse.papyrus.git/log/extraplugins/umlrt/org.eclipse.papyrus.umlrt.ui?h=streams/1.0-maintenance

It should also be pushed to master.
