DESCRIPTION:

Bug 570856: [Toolsmiths][AF] Improve messages for command-class constraints

- introduce custom messages for problems in the command class attributes
- includes a second step to distinguish diagnosis of missing class versus
  a class that doesn't implement the expected protocol
- requires generation of the plug-in class for the Papyrus Representation model
- update existing JUnit tests to accommodate new diagnostic messages

- rename 'ceationCommandExists' constraint operations as 'creationCommandExists'
- maintain API compatibility with strong deprecations

Error messages look great now! Thanks Christian.
Implementation wise, we are still API compatible, which is perfect

I don't yet know @AuxProject, @TestProject and @OverlayFile. Is there a documentation for these new annotations ?

Thanks for your review, Vincent! I have elected to roll back the renaming of misspelled API names as (a) it isn't actually necessary to fix the bug from the user's perspective and (b) these names aren't very important to Papyrus developers or extenders, anyways.

On the matter of the test annotations, they are defined locally in the toolsmiths.validation.common.tests bundle and have some sketchy documentation in Javadocs. These are meant to support the tests for the plug-in builders, but if they are of general interest, it should be possible to push them up to the org.eclipse.papyrus.junit.utils bundle. But that would be out of scope, I think. For now, I'll attempt to improve their Javadocs. Is there some other place where they should be documented, also? I'd be happy to do that, too.

The last point is the matter of @generated NOT in the RepresentationPlugin constructor. I don't think there's a way to avoid that without duplicating strings, which seems not great to do. See my reply comment in-line for more on that.
Line:3, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.architecture/model/Architecture.genmodel -> Ack

Line:212, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.architecture/src-gen/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/architecture/ArchitectureContext.java -> I strongly disagree with this position. As a project on the Simultaneous Release train, Papyrus should follow the common development guidelines of Eclipse projects, including API evolution (https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs_2). For better or for worse, these misnamed methods (and static fields in the package interface) are publicly exported API and are subject to the evolution guidelines. It doesn't matter that they are generated.

As it isn't actually necessary to rename these methods to address the issue reported in the bug, I'll be happy just to revert all of the renaming and deprecations and just leave the improved validation messages.

Line:25, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.representation/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Yes, I neglected to revert the EMF generation of these dependencies!

Line:3, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.representation/model/GmfDiagRepresentation.genmodel -> Ack

Line:48, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.representation/src-gen/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/gmfdiag/representation/impl/RepresentationPlugin.java -> Why not? I do usually prefer the <methodName>Gen(...) pattern, but we cannot use it here because only a constructor can call the superclass constructor and a constructor name has to match the class name exactly. I don't see an alternative to @generated NOT.
