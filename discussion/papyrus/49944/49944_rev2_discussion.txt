I made another small enhancement (patchset 2). You can cancel the first hudson build to get to the second more quickly!

I assume that the "extra components" are still open to commits for the Mars-ish release, right @Camille?
Line:243, extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/cdo/core/resource/CDOAwareModelSet.java -> Does super.unload() manifest problems when there is no open view?  Do we not still need to do what super.unload() does with ordinary (non-CDO) resources when there is no view?

Remember that this ModelSet is *always* used, even for regular workspace models, when the CDO integration plug-ins are installed.  There is only ever one implementation of a Papyrus Service such as the model-set in the registry.

Perhaps some of the CDO view management behaviour will need to be factored out of the model-set into something else?  a snippet or an optional service?

Line:142, extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.ui/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/cdo/internal/ui/editors/PapyrusCDOEditorManager.java -> Is this still a to-do?  What does it mean?

Line:151, tests/junit/extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/cdo/internal/ui/editors/tests/BasicEditorTest.java -> The name "handlesConflict" suggest it is a boolean-valued query.  Should this be "handleConflict"?

Or is it just that an @Test annotation is missing?  Then the name would make sense to me.

Line:152, tests/junit/extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/cdo/internal/ui/editors/tests/BasicEditorTest.java -> That's a lot of iterations.  How long does it run?  Is it an aleatory test?  Depending on a race condition or something?

Line:243, extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.core/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/cdo/core/resource/CDOAwareModelSet.java -> You're right. I'll remove the guard...

Line:142, extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.ui/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/cdo/internal/ui/editors/PapyrusCDOEditorManager.java -> Yes, this is still a to-do.

Line:151, tests/junit/extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/cdo/internal/ui/editors/tests/BasicEditorTest.java -> Yes, I removed @Test. I tried to stay consistent with the existing naming of test methods as established by yourself, e.g., isLocked(), etc...

With interactive conflict resolution the existing conflict test doesn't work anymore. And actually I don't know how to test the new mechansim because that pops up a modal dialog at commit time.

Line:152, tests/junit/extraplugins/cdo/org.eclipse.papyrus.cdo.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/cdo/internal/ui/editors/tests/BasicEditorTest.java -> I can't remember that I've written this "test" method but the Git history says that I was it :P

I'll remove it...
