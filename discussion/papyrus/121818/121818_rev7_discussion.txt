This rebases to fix the merge conflicts, especially in the AsyncValidateCommand which, yes, on master branch uses a mechanism shared with other components and so is preferred.

I'll be interested to learn the results of Rémi's findFigureAt investigation.  In any case, getTargetEditPart re-direction could remain as is because it reflects the reality of which edit part actually should provide a command.  Right?

On the subject of the z-order of these figures:  I wonder whether we might not propose that combined fragments and their operands reside on a distinct *layer* above the layer that contains the lifelines and interaction fragments?  They seem to me to be a semantic grouping construct that is in some way orthogonal to the basic layout of lifelines and the fragments covering them. I don't know whether that would help or whether it would even make sense (my feeling is that layers in GEF have a different purpose, e.g. for handles, guides, and decorations, all of which are visual/editing aids and not notational)

One more thing:  this new commit includes a fix to the PapyrusEditorFixture's creation of shapes by tool automation, which mostly works as a replacement for the createOperand(...) method in the TestCFOperansSemanticCoverage class.  However, the resulting coverage updates from the creation of operands using the fixture seems to miss the sending ends of messages that should become owned by the new operand (the receiving ends are okay, as are execution-occurrences).  I'd like to dig into why that is, because it seems to me that it should be a problem for users that (of course) operate the creation tool from the palette.
