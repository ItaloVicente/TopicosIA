Patch Set 2:

Similar to Gerrit 121613, it's not clear to me what the scope of the Validation is/should be.

Since CF/Operand coverage doesn't work properly yet, it's hard to test this (Visually the message is wrong, but the validation is OK because the message is semantically correct. The problem lies in the inconsistency between semantics and graphics, and I guess it's a separate issue)
