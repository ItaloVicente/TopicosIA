This patch currently conflicts with master, especially the AsyncValidateCommand, which seems to use a different strategy for executing validation, compared to master. My guess is that master is the correct one?

In general, I believe customizing getFigureAt() for the Lifeline figure is the way to go (Rather than getTargetEditPart()), but I'm not sure what Rémi's investigation status is (I know he tried that, but I don't know the results. I believe there were still some open questions regarding nested CFs).

Customizing getFigureAt() would not only solve the Creation issues, but also selection (Currently, it's hard to select a CF because the Lifelines are placed on top and get easily selected)

getFigureAt() would also solve feedback issues (Bug 534265), which is the ticket Rémi was investigating

One final comment (maybe :) ). I obviously meant "findFigureAt" rather than "getFigureAt", and it actually delegates to "Figure.containsPoint(int, int)", which is the method we'd need to customize for LifelineFigure
