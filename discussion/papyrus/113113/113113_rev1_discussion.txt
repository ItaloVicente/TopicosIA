DESCRIPTION:

Bug 528343: [I18N] Preference checking overhead for models that don't use i18n

As long as no models encountered by the UML item-provider adapter
factory for i18n enable i18n, just provide the superclass's
standard adapters.  Using a new event-listener protocol, detect
when a model for which item-provider adapters were already created
is the first to enable i18n and then re-create all adapters.

Also improve performance of the i18n utility's tracking of
preference stores and fix the hash code calculation of the
PapyrusProjectScope (as it matters now that it is used as the
key in a map).

> Uploaded patch set 1.

For the model comparison scenario referenced in the bug, which saw 1317 invocations of the InternationalizationPreferenceUtils::getInternationalizationPreference(URI) method take a total of 690 ms on average, this patch reduces that to 299 calls for 70 ms.  Yes, this patch also improves the internal performance of the method in question.

It should be noted that this performance improvement will only be effective for users that either

* do not use internationalization in any of their models, or at least
* have not yet opened any model that uses internationalization

This is because Papyrus maintains a single ComposedAdapterFactory, including the InternationalizationUMLItemProviderAdapterFactory, for all model editors and related views in the workbench.  This is created by some UML plug-in activator and is only disposed on shutdown of the workbench.  So, if any model is opened that uses internationalization, then the i18n-equipped item providers have to be created, and they will be used in all contexts thereafter until the workbench is closed.

This could be further improved in the future by either

* removing this singleton and having every editor and view create its own adapter factory (preferred), or
* updating the InternalizationUMLItemProviderAdapterFactory to maintain two sets of adapters, one for i18n-ized models and one for the rest.  I'm unsure that this wouldn't incur much of the performance overhead again that we are trying to address in the first place, but in looking for which item-providers to use instead of within those item-providers.  It would have to be tried and measured

For now, I'd like to ask Philip to try this patch in his scenarios in which he tested changes in the EMF Compare code to address the same original performance concerns.  I don't know the particular details of those scenarios, having just tested this myself using the EMF Compare performance models.
