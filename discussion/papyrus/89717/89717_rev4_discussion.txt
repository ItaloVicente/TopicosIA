Vincent could you explain me why you didn't make the following changes.
is it important or not?
thanks for advices
Line:475, plugins/developer/org.eclipse.papyrus.releng.main.release/release.xml -> even if it is generated when releasing i think we could upgrade it?

Line:57, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.toolsmiths/plugin.xml -> why you din't change this one?

Line:6, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.toolsmiths/schema/contextStorage.exsd -> naming homogenization?

Line:53, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.toolsmiths/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/toolsmiths/Activator.java -> naming homogenization

Line:36, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.toolsmiths/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/toolsmiths/editor/actions/TogglePreviewAction.java -> i think it is important

ProjectUtil must be removed from the patch set -> no change inside
Line:475, plugins/developer/org.eclipse.papyrus.releng.main.release/release.xml -> I have no idea about the versioning.

Line:57, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.toolsmiths/plugin.xml -> I don't update it, because I didn't have time to check if all was working good after. 
Of course, it is better to update it too.

Line:6, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.toolsmiths/schema/contextStorage.exsd -> Here, you are renaming an extension point, so all Papyrus contribution to it must be updated

+ all project depending on Papyrus must update their code too. I think it is not a good idea to update it

Line:53, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.toolsmiths/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/toolsmiths/Activator.java -> when you rename of view or a perspective, you can impact contribution to them. 

In the case of the property view, I think nobody contribute to it (execpted Papyrus itself)

Line:36, plugins/views/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.properties.toolsmiths/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/properties/toolsmiths/editor/actions/TogglePreviewAction.java -> only if you updated this string in other location too.
