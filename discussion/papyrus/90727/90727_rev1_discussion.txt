DESCRIPTION:

Bug 511917 - [Model import] update the model import tool to produce a
Port_NameLabel view without an explicit set of element

* the toLabel() mapping that creates the DecorationNode PortNameLabel
inherits from toPapyrusNode mapping that inherits from toPapyrusNodeView
mapping that set the  
element : PortNameLabel should not in any case set the element, the
element is set in the Port_Shape view. for the inherited ports this
creates a conflict and did not display the label -->  create an abstract
mapping just like PapyrusConnectorLabel and ensure that we did not set
the element in this mapping. toLabel() inherits now the new mapping  

* add junit test to be sure that for all PortNameLabel View no element
was set

I've made a quick test of this in context of Papyrus-RT, and it seem to work as expected. The labels of the inherited ports, including the additional issue with one of the ports on the inherited capsule parts, are now visible.

Thanks Peter for the quick test, The build was triggered but the build did not appear on gerrit

Any way, I will merge this patch and cherry pick it to master (oxygene).
