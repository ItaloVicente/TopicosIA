Good work! After investigating, I think you are close to the good solution. 
I think, this is probably the method called refreshTabs which have a bug ( or a method close to this one). 
Nevertheless, fixing the bug in the editor doesn't seem me the good way. I think, it will be better fixing the bug directly in SashWindowsContainer (if it is possible). 

Debugging, I observed that the refresh is called (at least) 3 times closing a digram. The first one activate the good page, the second is ignored (refresh inside a refresh) and the third (or later?) activate the WelcomePage. Maybe some notifications should be removed/ignored, so another way to explore ?

That was our first investigation: modifying the SashWindowsContainer --> checkAndGetActivePage because this method is responsible of setting the active page to the first non orphaned page found in the garbageMaps: it calls garbageMaps.getFirstValidPage() to set the returned page as the active page. But wa were facing a dependecies pb: introduce a cycle: because this class is in core plugin while the PapyrusNavigationLocation and co are in ui plugins and we can not introduce a ui dependencies in core plugins :(

Regarding this about "refresh inside refresh", that one I have written https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=491238 If you have issues in this area, I would strongly suggest to that take care of that bug at the same time to avoid getting those "refresh inside refresh" entries in the error log every time you close a diagram in the model editor (which is exactly the case that we are about to handle here). So please take a look at that bug at the same time here.

In fact, the title of the bug is not good.

The precise bug is: when a diagram/page is closed, the first page (not necessary the Welcome page) is selected. 

I am not sure that, in SashWindowsContainer, the first refresh takes the "good" page. The good page should be the last opened and visited, not the last/next active. 

For selecting the last opened and visited page, it is necessary to have access to NavigationHistory, and I do not know how I can have access to it from SashWindowsContainer.

Hi,

About the code location:
------------------------
For me, such code should be located in a separated class, started as a service.
The class org.eclipse.papyrus.editor.PapyrusMultiDiagramEditor is not designed to hold code dedicated to a particular task. Neither its parent CoreMultiDiagramEditor.

The two "synchronizer" previously added should also be moved as services in separated classes. 
The PapyrusNavigationHistorySynchronizer requires hooks from org.eclipse.ui.INavigationLocationProvider. Such hook, which are 'editor ui' hooks can be located in 'CoreMultiDiagramEditor' if there is no other ways to do that.  But the synchronizer should be started as a service.

About the algorithm :
---------------------
The provided code check if the current page is closed each time the tabs are refreshed. 
There is an event indicating when a page/tab is closed :
org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor.editor.IPageLifeCycleEventsListener.pageClosed(IPage)

Can't you use it instead ?
