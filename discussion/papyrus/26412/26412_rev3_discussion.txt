Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

The framework looks good! I have a few remarks however (Based on new use cases, which initially hadn't been identified)

The initial idea was to do the migration when opening an Editor: this allows lazy migration (You don't migrate all the diagrams at once), and you don't have to search into resources to find the diagrams to migrate (Which simplifies the process).

However, in some cases (Especially the new viewpoint-based diagrams), the diagram has become completely invalid (Because the type of the diagram has changed), and cannot even be opened (We'll never reach DiagramEditor#setInput()).

This is the case for Package Diagram (The ID changed from "Package" to "PapyrusUMLClassDiagram", as it has been re-implemented as a subset of the ClassDiagram), and for all RobotML Diagrams (Same reason).

So, for these cases, the only solution seems to trigger the migration when the notation resource is loaded (Which adds some complexity, as the notation resource can be either the main resource, a notation resource associated to a controlled model, or a notation resource associated to an imported model)


Regarding the usability, the commands should not be executed in the CommandStack: the user must not be able to "undo" the migration. Papyrus provides a "GMFUnsafe" helper to execute transactions outside the command stack (Useful to bypass the read-only state of the imported diagrams, for example. Read-only diagrams must be migrated as well: you won't be able to save them, but you must still be able to open them properly)
