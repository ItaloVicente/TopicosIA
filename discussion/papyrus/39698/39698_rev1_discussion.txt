DESCRIPTION:

457560: [Performances] The ReadOnlyManager does too many File System accesses
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=457560

Implement caching of read-only state of objects and resources for the duration of the active transaction when read-only checking is done within a transactional context.

Patch Set 1:

Notes about the design:

* the "disable read-only caching" transaction option could easily be recast as an "enable read-only caching" option if caching turns out not to be useful in the general case

* the changes in the AbstractReadOnlyHandler inject caching of resource read-only state in the scope of a transaction only, specifically for those handlers that don't implement object-level read-only state.  These all just map object read-onlyness to read-onlyness of the containing resource (AFAIK, only the CDO handler implements object-level read-only state)

* caching read-onlyness of individual EObjects is subject to a problem where an object moves into or out of a read-only resource within the transaction.  Admittedly, this is silly because it shouldn't be able to do that, but you should try disabling the EObject cache to see whether the caching of read-only state per resource isn't sufficient to fix our performance issue (I suspect it may be).  It would be nice to simplify this

* I've taken a short-cut to simply clear out the cache whenever any object or resource is made writable on the assumption that the cost of rebuilding the cache is comparable anyways to making stuff writable and that it will only happen once typically in a transaction.  Besides that it's the edge case

The caching mechanism is not so expensive, and a lot of transactions access or modify more than one element at a time (Especially diagram operations), so I'm convinced that it makes sense even in the general case

In the specific case of the migration tool, we only invoke the Repair Dependencies/Repair Stereotypes operation (Which need to be executed in the context of an EditingDomain), so such moves won't occur, and caching the state of the Resource is always sufficient. In the general case, you can't move an object from a Read-only resource to a Read-Write resource (Or vice versa), because that implies modifying both resources (Unless there are transaction options to bypass that, in which case I don't really know what would or should happen... but if this option is enabled, you don't need the read-only manager anyway)

Regarding the performances of the current cache, I have the same results I had with my hacked static Hashmap "cache", i.e. 14 seconds instead of 26 (45% performance improvement).

Agreed
