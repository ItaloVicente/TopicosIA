Okay, so the region dispaly bug is fixed by some other patch. An update of my observations, by order of importance:

- When I hover over a state or state machine already with a region, the assistant does not propose to create another region, although a state can have several regions.
- When I create a behavior for as doActivity, entry, or exit, the label for the behavior is shown twice. This only happens when it is created with the assistant.
- The entry and exit point icons are the same in the assistant.
- The assistant does not appear near the mouse, but to the far right of an element.
- When I hover over a region, I don't have any assistance to create states, pseudostates, etc... But maybe this is normal?

I can reproduce all the issues that Shuai describes.

@Christian: do you know whether it's possible to have different icons for entry/exit point? I guess, the problem is that boths are pseudo states, but with a different "kind" (are icons taken from oep.uml.icons/resource/gif/?)
