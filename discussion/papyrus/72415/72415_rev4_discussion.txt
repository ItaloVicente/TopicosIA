Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

I will merge this because but for the record, here are my observations compared to the previous ones (they will be posted in bugzilla):

- When I hover over a state or state machine already with a region, the assistant does not propose to create another region, although a state can have several regions ==> It proposes to create a region when there are no regions, but only when there are no regions. Later we might want to add multi-region support.
- When I create a behavior for as doActivity, entry, or exit, the label for the behavior is shown twice. This only happens when it is created with the assistant. ==> This feature has been removed.
- The entry and exit point icons are the same in the assistant. ==> Same.
- The assistant does not appear near the mouse, but to the far right of an element. ==> Same.
- When I hover over a region, I don't have any assistance to create states, pseudostates, etc... But maybe this is normal? ==> Same.
- Figures created with the assistant are always places in the same location.
