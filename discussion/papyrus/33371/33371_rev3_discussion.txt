DESCRIPTION:

444092: [Properties view] Refresh issues for stereotype properties
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=444092

The source of a StereotypeModelElement is the application (instance) of the stereotype applied.  So, when updating the model-element for a change in selection, the new source must be the new UML element's application of the stereotype, not the new UML element.  Moreover, we must be careful that the StereotypeModelElement tracks the stereotype indicated by the DataContext, which may be a superstereotype (possibly abstract or otherwise not actually applicable) of the stereotype actually applied to any given UML element.

Patch Set 3:

A very good point about the abstract or otherwise inapplicable superstereotypes.  Patch set 3 addresses that by simply looking up the DataContext's stereotype without regard for whether it is applicable to the selection.  This is followed then by finding which sub-stereotype (possibly the stereotype, itself) is actually applied (note that *some* sub-stereotype must be applied otherwise this DataContext would not have matched the selected element; even so, failures are handled by warning logs).

The expected behaviour is observed on this new patch in the model newly attached to the bug, with the Papyrus implementation of SysML, and with my own modified SysML that removed all property definitions for the ConstraintBlock stereotype.

Thanks!

I'm testing another use case which may not be covered: stereotype inheritance from another profile. Will the super stereotype be able to retrieve all specifics, including the one defined in another profile? (Haven't tested yet, I'm having trouble to merge the commit, and EGit doesn't really help)

Regarding the Gerrit contribution, I see that the commit is based on the Luna branch, but Gerrit tells that the target branch is master. I'm not sure what will happen if the commit is submitted

Yes, that's a possibility.  The SR0 implementation, in looking for applied substereotypes, scanned profiles applied in the element's context for all stereotypes that specialize a stereotype of the given qualified name.  That bottom-up search can find superstereotypes in non-applied profiles, which the top-down search might not.

How does one tell Gerrit a different target branch?

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I've been able to confirm that the use case mentioned in Comment 15 doesn't work

I've attached a new project to Bug 444092:

- Create a new profile extending the first one
- Apply this new profile to the same model (With or without the original profile)
- Apply a stereotype from this new profile to a Class
- Select the class: the properties view Tab doesn't appear at all
