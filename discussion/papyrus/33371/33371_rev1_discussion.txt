DESCRIPTION:

444092: [Properties view] Refresh issues for stereotype properties
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=444092

The source of a StereotypeModelElement is the application (instance) of the stereotype applied.  So, when updating the model-element for a change in selection, the new source must be the new UML element's application of the stereotype, not the new UML element.

> Stereotype stereotype = stereotypeElement.stereotype; // Cannot be a different stereotype for the same element

The initial method (doCreateFromSource) tries to retrieve a compatible stereotype applied on the current UML Element (strict = false in UMLUtil.getAppliedStereotype). For example, if you are looking for SysML::Blocks::Block, and you find a SysML::Blocks::ConstraintBlock, then the ConstraintBlock Stereotyped is returned (Because ConstraintBlock extends Block).

By generation, the ConstraintBlock properties view will always have a higher priority than the Block properties view, and will override it. But for the general case, you may have only a properties view defined for Block, and it should match ConstraintBlock. So, switching selection from a ConstraintBlock to a Block will probably fail in this case.

Note that this is not easy to provide a test case, since all the profile-based properties view in Papyrus are generated on the same pattern, which doesn't run into this specific issue. Maybe it should be possible to reproduce the issue by making a copy of the SysML properties view configuration, and removing the ConstraintBlock view definitions. Then, the Block properties view should apply to both Block and ConstraintBlock
