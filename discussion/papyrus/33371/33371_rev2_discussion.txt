DESCRIPTION:

444092: [Properties view] Refresh issues for stereotype properties
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=444092

The source of a StereotypeModelElement is the application (instance) of the stereotype applied.  So, when updating the model-element for a change in selection, the new source must be the new UML element's application of the stereotype, not the new UML element.  Moreover, we must be careful that the StereotypeModelElement tracks the stereotype indicated by the DataContext, which may be a superstereotype of the stereotype actually applied to any given UML element.

Patch Set 2:

A revised patch that is careful to track in the StereotypeModelElement the stereotype referenced by the DataContext, not the actual stereotype applied to the UML element, which could be a superstereotype of the DataContext's stereotype.

Testing this with a custom properties model copied from SysML, in which I removed the ConstraintBlock view, section, and data-context, I observe:

  * the StereotypeModelElement for Blocks and ConstraintBlocks alike records the
     Block stereotype for the DataSource supporting the SingleBlock view
  * the "MySysML" tab's controls all refresh correctly in values and enablement
     when changing the selection from a ConstraintBlock to a Block and back
     (without the fix, I saw the "stereotype not applied" warning in the log when
     the selection changed)
  * the "MySysML" tab doesn't flicker because its controls are all re-used, the
     same Block data-context and views being applied to both Blocks and
     ConstraintBlocks
     
As there are some new utility methods employed in the UMLUtil class, I added some JUnit tests for them.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

ApplicableStereotype may be a little bit too strict. What if the parent stereotype is abstract? It may still have some properties applicable to a set of selected elements (And thus have an associated properties view), but will not be considered to be "applicable".

Steps:

- Create a profile with an Abstract stereotype (S1) containing one property (P1) and 2 specializations of this stereotype (S2, S3)
- Generate a properties view for this profile and delete the views "S2" and "S3" (Single + Multiple). Only Single S1 and Multiple S1 should remain
- Deploy the properties view
- Create a model and apply the profile
- Create two elements and stereotype them respectively with S2 and S3 (Note that S1 is not applicable)
- Select the element and verify the P1 property

Without Patch Set 2:

- The P1 property is properly displayed, but not properly refreshed when switching selection between <<S2>> and <<S3>>

With Patch Set 2:

- The P1 is properly displayed, but switching selection fails with:

> !ENTRY org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.properties 2 0 2014-09-16 11:22:40.830
> !MESSAGE Stereotype 'Profile::Stereotype2' is not applied on 'org.eclipse.uml2.uml.internal.impl.ClassImpl@2a5e8660 (name: Class2, visibility: <unset>) (isLeaf: false, isAbstract: false, isFinalSpecialization: false) (isActive: false)'

- The P1 property keeps the previous value but is still editable

(And surprisingly, I have different behaviors with S2 and S3: S3 is never editable, whereas S2 is, unless we are switching selection from S3. Switching between different instances of S2 seems to work)

I will attach the test project to the Bugzilla
