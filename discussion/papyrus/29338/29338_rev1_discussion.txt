Line:140, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.common/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/common/strategy/paste/StereotypePasteStrategy.java -> If you run the formatter, it will add some whitespace here.

Line:198, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.common/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/common/strategy/paste/StereotypePasteStrategy.java -> Why are we deleting compartments, here?  The compound command's label is about copying stereotypes ...

Line:70, plugins/uml/tools/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.tools/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/tools/commands/DuplicateStereotypeCommand.java -> What about base_Package, base_Property, base_Element, base_OpaqueExpression, ... ?  This only works for stereotypes extending the Class metaclass.  Other stereotype copies will have their metaclass extensions corrupted.

Also, stereotype associations will be copied incorrectly (I think), referencing the wrong stereotype instance in the case where the referenced stereotype is also copied.  This needs to work more like the EcoreUtil::Copier's cross-reference handling.  And do we support associations between stereotypes and classes defined in the profile?  UML2 API does.  This code seems to assume that anything that isn't a metaclass extension is an EAttribute that is easily copied ...

And test cases involving associations to profile-defined classes.  And undo/redo for good measure (yes, it should be handled automatically, but there are factors that can interfere).

Can/should that be covered by the tests?
