DESCRIPTION:

Bug 516459 - [Diagram] Navigation mechanism with Alt+hover does not work on Linux

- Change key from ALT to CTRL+SHIFT to avoid key-binding conflict on Linux machine.
- Restore original behavior that the menu is only visible while the key is pressed
- Delay menu appeareance until mouse is mouved in both graphical viewer and model
  explorer. This avoids key-binding conflichts with CTRL+SHIFT-C/X/V for graphical
  copy/paste
- The menu goes away on the first click outside its area (and does not come back
  again while CTRL is pressed).
- Simplify programming, since activation in graphical editor and model explorer is
  much more similar.
