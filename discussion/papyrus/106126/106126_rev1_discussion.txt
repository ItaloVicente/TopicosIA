DESCRIPTION:

Bug 516459 - [Diagram] Navigation mechanism with Alt+hover does not work on Linux

- Change key from ALT to CTRL to avoid key-binding conflict on Linux machine.
- Restore original behavior that the menu is only visible while the key is pressed
  These first two properties make the menu more intuitive for JDT users
- Assure that the menu will appear immediately in the graphical viewer as well
- The menu goes away on the first click outside its area (and does not come back
  again while CTRL is pressed). This property assures that the menu is not
  annoying in case of multi-selections, which also uses CTRL + click
- Simplify programming, since activation in graphical editor and model explorer is
  much more similar.

Good point on CTRL being used in multi-selection. It might be problematic to bind to CTRL then. The other solution would be to completely remove this quick navigation in the Model Explorer, and keep it only in the Diagram Editor. This is the behavior of JDT: you can CTRL+Click in the Java Editor, but not in the Package Explorer (doesn't make sense in JDT). Don't forget, we still have navigation in the Model Explorer with right-click.

Actually in the Diagram Editor we can also multi-select so the problem still stands. I think it will be extremely annoying if the quick navigation menu appears whenever we just want to multi-select.

Apart from CTRL+Click which is discussable, we should keep the other improvements in this patch though.

We should also cherry pick the other improvements to Oxygen.

Personally, I don't find it is annoying, since the menu goes away when selecting the 2nd element - so it would be good to have a 2nd opinion on that.
A multi selection can also be started by holding shift: in the graphical editor, only the selected elements are added, whereas the model explorer also adds "in between" element (i.e. in this case, the user has to use CTRL).

After actually modeling a bit more, I'll found out that a more severe issue is that all other CTRL key bindings (CTRL-A, -C, -V) don't work until the menu is dismissed.
