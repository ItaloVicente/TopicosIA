DESCRIPTION:

Bug 496299: Controlled Units as Integral Fragments
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=496299

Implement a new mode of controlled unit in Papyrus dubbed "shards".
A shard is like any other sub-unit created up to and including the
Neon release, except that it cannot be opened independently in the
editor.  The Papyrus editor, when asked to open a "shard", will
instead open the root resource of the model.  Likewise, the editor
matcher normalizes editor inputs to the root resource of any shard.

The graph of shard dependencies is inferred from a new workspace-
wide index of cross-resource containment references, when it is
available.  Otherwise, the linkage of shards to their parent
references is parsed on-the-fly from the shard annotation's
reference (with a relatively efficient XML parsing that terminates
after reading only a few lines of the XMI text).

The ModelSet is enhanced with a pluggable hook for the demand-load
helper, to force the loading of a shard's parent resource chain from
the top down to ensure that all context of profile applications is
available before loading the shard, itself, which may have stereotype
applications that depend on those profile applications.

Some additional fixes are required in other core components to make
the loading of referenced sharded models as in bug 458837 work:

* the SemanticUMLContentProvider did not detect the final resolution
  of containment proxies that changes what looks look a model root
  object into just another intermediate element in the content tree.
  Besides that it would schedule a large number of redundant
  UI refreshes asynchronously (deferred) on the UI thread

* the DiModel and NotationModel would load their adjuncts to the *.uml
  resource when that resource is created, not after it has been loaded.
  This is much too early and ends up causing the transactional editing
  domain to detect the attachment of a resource's contents at the end
  of loading as an attempt to edit the model during a read-only
  transaction, which logs an exception and bombs the UI action.
  Instead, these models now have snippets that load the *.di and
  *.notation resources after the semantic resource has been loaded.

* the new model snippets required an additional fix in the loading
  of IModels to handle contributions of snippets and dependencies to
  models that are overridden by other IModels registered under the
  same ID, such as is the case with the NotationModel and the
  CSSNotationModel, which latter needs the snippet declared by the
  former

* the IModels additionally need to ensure that they start snippets
  on loading of an existing model even when it is already found to
  be loaded in the ModelSet (as happens often in JUnit tests)

* the AbstractModelFixture in the JUnit test framework is updated to
  ensure that the ModelSet is properly initialized, with its own
  snippets started and its IModels loaded and their snippets started

Still to be done, especially because now the shard annotation does have
a reference to the object in the parent resource that contains the root
object of the shard, is an uncontrol participant to remove the shard
annotation (control participant not required because the user-facing
control action doesn't created shards but sub-models)

> Uploaded patch set 5.

This update rebases the patch and fixes a new deadlock scenario, in which deletion of a project
would deadlock the UI if the current editor's model was in the project being deleted and therefore that editor had to be closed and another Papyrus editor activated that had never previously been loaded in the current Eclipse session.
