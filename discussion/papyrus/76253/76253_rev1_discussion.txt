DESCRIPTION:

Bug 496299: Controlled Units as Integral Fragments
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=496299

Implement a new mode of controlled unit in Papyrus dubbed "shards".
A shard is like any other sub-unit created up to and including the
Neon release, except that it cannot be opened independently in the
editor.  The Papyrus editor, when asked to open a "shard", will
instead open the root resource of the model.  Likewise, the editor
matcher normalizes editor inputs to the root resource of any shard.

The graph of shard dependencies is inferred from a new workspace-
wide index of cross-resource containment references
