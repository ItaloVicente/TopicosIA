DESCRIPTION:

441857: [Performances - Model Explorer] Severe performance problems for larger models
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=441857

Be more precise about what exactly needs to be refreshed in the Model Explorer in response to model changes and which labels need to be updated.  Let the UMLLabelProvider, when used in a label-provider service context, react to changes in the resource set and post label-provider-change events for affected objects.

Patch Set 2:

I've updated the change set to remove the IDependentLabelProvider that I didn't like.  Instead, now the UMLLabelProvider is a service that acts as a subordinate of the LabelProviderService.  When instantiated as a service, it uses a new UMLLabelDependenciesService to efficiently listen for changes in the resource set and compute objects that need to have labels updated.  When not installed as a service (which is also commonly the case), then none of this machinery is engaged.

I like this better because it doesn't introduce new API and lets the label provider take care of its own concerns, which is as it should be.

Taking another approach, improving the intrinsic performance of EMF Facet (which apparently lost some optimizations in the 0.1->0.2 refactoring), shows promise.  Initial results suggest that even just caching the facet-operation overrides makes Model Explorer updates an order of magnitude quicker than before.
