Patch Set 1:

A further change in how Model Explorer manages refresh, to avoid recalculating the entire tree structure on every model edit, which doesn't scale well on large models.

First, the Model Explorer's resource-set listener now only schedules structural refreshes for the specific objects that notified changes.

Second, the UMLLabelProvider fires LabelProviderChangedEvents to trigger label updates for elements that derive their labels from other related elements, when those related elements are changed.  This required a new mix-in interface for label providers in the Label Provider Service to allow Model Explorer and other clients to pass notifications to them on changes in the model.  I'm not entirely happy with this solution, but it does address a couple of issues with the approach I would rather have taken, which is having individual label providers listen for model changes themselves:

  * the providers registered with the Label Provider Service aren't initialized with a
    ResourceSet, ServicesRegistry, or other context in which they can find the
    model to listen to
  * providers could discover, as they are asked to provide labels, the objects they
    need to listen to.  But should they be Adapters or ResourceSetListeners?  And
    can we be sure that they won't leak, that the providers will be disposed at the
    right time so that they can remove listeners/adapters?
  * only the Model Explorer (for now) needs label providers to trigger updates.
    Element-picker dialogs and other widgets in the Properties view, for example,
    don't have this need, so this design ensures that the large number of other
    UMLLabelProviders that are created (there are lots) don't all listen for model
    changes
    
I am willing to explore this alternative further if reviewers agree that the new IDependentLabelProvider interface isn't a great thing.

Another point that I'm not sure about is the changes in the SemanticUMLContentProvider to prevent addition/removal of stereotype applications from a resource triggering complete refresh of the Model Explorer.  I don't know in what contexts this might break some UI that depends on that refresh trigger.  The consequence of reverting the SemanticUMLContentProvider changes is only that applying/unapplying stereotypes results in a long lag in the UI on large models as the Model Explorer refreshes itself.  This may be acceptable; comment is welcome.
