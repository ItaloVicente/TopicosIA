DESCRIPTION:

Bug 522518 - [Oomph] The setup file needs to be updated

- add the new oxygen maintenance branch and set the master to photon
- remove lingering references to oxygen in the extras
- add the aggregated bugzilla search task
- left the default branch to Oxygen as photon is still experimental/unreleased
- added a new eclipse.ini parameter: bundlefile.limit200 in order to paliate the performances problems until Camille's patch to swt is merged and released

I actually have a problem getting "sub references" when a same aggregator file lists multiple repositories. I d not know/ did not found a way to tell the updater to check them based on the order in the aggregator file.
As it is it always pulls the first it finds.

PS: indeed the formating is crushed when going through the papyrus updater! that will make things easier to read :)

Nicely done!  This has gotten so complicated that it seriously feels like it's time to introduce another (meta-)level of tooling to have something generate this after the fashion of the *.tpd language for PDE target definitions.
Line:48, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> Hah, good one.

Line:85, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> I suppose it's the updater tool that does this, but it doesn't agree with the ${base.downloads.url} form used elsewhere for generality.  That pattern is probably no longer relevant, so maybe it's best just to use the literal URLs everywhere and eliminate the base.downloads.url variable?

Line:792, releng/org.eclipse.papyrus.oomph/setups/papyrus.setup -> Yup.

Thanks for the review !
I removed the base.downloads.url as it indeed introduces unecessary complications.

I will also ask around for the swbot import/dependecy as I do not think we have anything related to this anymore (but that can be for another update).
