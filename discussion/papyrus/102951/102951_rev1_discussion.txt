DESCRIPTION:

Bug 520815: [UsecaseDiagram] UsecaseDiagram must be regenerated to get code generation changes from bug 520733
	- update gmfgen to 3.0.0 version
	- I kept changes in plugin.xml (to avoid to get new changes next time)
	- I kept changes in MANIFEST.MF (to avoid to get new changes next time)
	- changes in EditPart are OK, they are due to an other changes in the template and the generation was not yet done
	- changes in UMLViewProvider are the changes expected for the current bug
Bug 520882: [DiaGen] contribution to "org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.emf.type.core.elementTypeBindings" must be removed.
	- remove contribution in the plugin.xml, as expected by the bug 520882
