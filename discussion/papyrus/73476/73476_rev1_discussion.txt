DESCRIPTION:

bug 493876: [LinkLF] Some links are not aligned anymore after migration from Luna to Mars
 - The problem comes from anchors which are not yet SlidableSnapToGridAnchor but SlidableAnchor. So we need to change edit part and figures to get the same behavior than in Luna.
 - This first commit works fine, but we need to clean it because several classes exist now in GMF.
