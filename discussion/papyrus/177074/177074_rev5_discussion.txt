DESCRIPTION:

Bug 571629: [Properties] Undo fails and other problems with applied stereotypes

- use edit service to get apply/unapply stereotype commands
- compose commands for multiple selection removal and dialog scenario
- implement a stereotype application reordering command with correct undo/redo
- correct support for reordering of multiple selection
- dynamic enablement of buttons
- account for unspecified ordering of multiple selections in a tree
- apply and unapply profiles also needs to go through the edit helpers
- unapplying profile implies unapplication of its stereotypes, so add an
  advice that approves stereotype unapplication in approval of profile unapplication

Line:57, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.service.types/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/service/types/helper/advice/PackageProfileAdvice.java -> I think this approach is a bit risky. When a profile is removed, all stereotypes should be unapplied. Especially, when a Profile has required Stereotypes, the UnapplyStereotypeRequest might be rejected as long as the Profile is applied, but becomes valid as soon as the Profile is unapplied. If this required Stereotype rule is enforced by an UnapplyStereotypeAdvice, then it will become impossible to unapply a profile that has required stereotypes.

We had similar issues with recursive Delete commands, e.g. for StateMachines that should have at least one Region: a RegionAdvice was making sure that we couldn't delete the last Region, making it impossible to delete a StateMachine that had exactly one Region (Because it would delete the last Region).

Line:492, plugins/uml/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.properties/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/properties/profile/ui/compositesformodel/AppliedStereotypeCompositeOnModel.java -> Why does this need to be async? Isn't this method invoked directly from the UI Thread?

Line:57, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.service.types/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/service/types/helper/advice/PackageProfileAdvice.java -> Yes, I think you're right. Unapplying a profile effectively changes the language of the model, which then makes Element Types Configurations associated with it irrelevant because they no longer are applicable to the model.

I need to remove this delegation. Thanks!

Line:492, plugins/uml/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.properties/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/properties/profile/ui/compositesformodel/AppliedStereotypeCompositeOnModel.java -> I wish I knew. All of the command execution in this and related classes was originally implemented in this asynchronous way. I don't know why. And if there was a reason for it, I don't want to break it. Certainly I would prefer not to do these things asynchronously!

Line:57, plugins/uml/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.service.types/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/service/types/helper/advice/PackageProfileAdvice.java -> 👍

Line:492, plugins/uml/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.properties/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/properties/profile/ui/compositesformodel/AppliedStereotypeCompositeOnModel.java -> Hmmm. It's an old piece of code that never really fitted in the "new" properties framework (the 2010 version). Let's leave it this way :) We'll probably replace it with Bug 572530 anyway.
