Applying advices of Remi and Christian.
I didn't put the maven nature even if i do not understand why applying xtend nature and not maven nature.
I didn't delete the xtend-folder to easy the life of eclipse developers, even if the folder is generate by the xtend eclipse or maven plugin.
This configuration should be the good.
please have a final look.

Looks good to me, thanks!

Who can verify that there is no custom code in the Xtend-generated Java files that are being deleted?  I know nothing of the Cpp component, so I would be hesitant to hit the Submit button.

What comments did R?mi make?  Why are they not in the Gerrit review?

About the m2e nature, in case the motivation for my earlier comments wasn't clear:  the xtend builder is already on the projects because it's required for Eclipse to run the Xtend code generation.  Adding the m2e builder would move the build within Eclipse from JDT to Maven, which (a) implies some overhead of maven repository and other stuff on the developer machine that to this point most people working with Papyrus sources have not had and (b) is a totally different problem to enabling clean Maven builds on the build server.

Ansgard is the one that can confirm that nothing specific was deleted in the generated code.

Using m2e builder would erase any building difference between hudson and dev environnement. (Check the mailing list around 22/01/2015)
=> We can talk about that in the mailing list for an other patch

I confirm that there are no modifications in the generated code.
Looks good to me (though I can currently not verify that the xtend-gen files will be re-added during build).
