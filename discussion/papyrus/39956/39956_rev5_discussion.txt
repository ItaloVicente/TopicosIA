Christian,
I have done a typicall example with the extraplugins/codegen/org.eclipse.papyrus.cpp.codegen
with all modifications that should be made.
for me this design should be the convention of the papyrus group.

If it is valid for you, I could replicate this to the other plugins where I have include the xtend maven plugin.
- deleting the xtend-gen folder
- adding it to the gitigone
- adding the maven nature

Another step in the right direction, but I still have some concerns, especially about introducing the m2e builder.
Line:1, extraplugins/codegen/org.eclipse.papyrus.cpp.codegen/.gitignore -> I would prefer that the xtend-gen/ folder actually exist in git with the .gitignore file inside that ignores the entire contents of the folder.  This ensures, then, that a new checkout from git will create the folder so that Eclipse JDT doesn't complain about folders missing from the source path etc.

Line:46, extraplugins/codegen/org.eclipse.papyrus.cpp.codegen/.project -> Let's not start converting projects to m2e build; that is a separate discussion that would affect all plug-in projects (not just those that have xtend sources).

Personally, I would like us not to adopt m2e, but the team needs to have the discussion.

Line:29, extraplugins/codegen/org.eclipse.papyrus.cpp.codegen/pom.xml -> With a .gitignore file in the xtend-gen/ folder, it would have to be excluded from the clean fileset.

Line:27, releng/top-pom-dev.xml -> For consistency, we should probably do a ${papyrus.eclipse.target} variable here, too.

We're *this* close to needing an even-more-top-pom.xml.  ;-)

Line:158, releng/top-pom-extras.xml -> :-)

Chrsitian,
I will setup a small discussion with Benoit and Camille on this element.
The m2e, the gitignore, the xtend-gen folder: they all belong to the same topic.
I will keep you in touch with it.
Francois
Line:1, extraplugins/codegen/org.eclipse.papyrus.cpp.codegen/.gitignore -> Hello
I will discuss about it with Camille and Benoit.
It is directly related also to the clean plugin and to the m2e nature.
We need to take a common decision on all these points.

nb: the target or bin directory is not commit to the git reposiotry. to mho, we need to apply the same rule for the xtend-gen directory.

Line:27, releng/top-pom-dev.xml -> Exactly.
In parrallele I came up with a discussion with Camille and Benoit to refactor the project folders in order to introduce such pom.
But it is a separate change.

Why do you say that introducing the m2e builder in the developer workbench is required to implement proper Xtend code generation on the build server?  I think these are orthogonal issues that merit separate discussion.
Line:1, extraplugins/codegen/org.eclipse.papyrus.cpp.codegen/.gitignore -> The m2e nature is a separate point: it changes how the Eclipse development environment builds our source projects.  The purpose of this Gerrit review is to change how the build system builds our source projects.

The target/ and bin/ directories are different from xtend-gen/ because:
* target/ is not used by Eclipse PDE/JDT in the workspace build. Eclipse doesn't care whether it exists or not and will not try to create it
* bin/ is not on the project's source path.  JDT creates it implicitly if it doesn't exist when the project is built; JDT cannot create xtend-gen/ in which to find Java sources for compilation. Consequently, JDT puts a big red error marker on the project
