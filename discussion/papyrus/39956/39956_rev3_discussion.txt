Looks generally OK to me, though I do have a question about cleaning .gitignore files that applies to all of the leaf-level POMs.

To answer an earlier question, I think the projects don't have the m2e project nature because that would cause m2e to take over the workspace build, which currently is just the usual old-school PDE/JDT build.  I'm happy with the status quo, but maybe since now we're using Tycho, perhaps we could be better aligned with m2e.  But how does it perform in a workspace with 200+ projects?
Line:29, extraplugins/codegen/org.eclipse.papyrus.cpp.codegen/pom.xml -> If the xtend-gen/ folder has a .gitignore file, then we should perhaps exclude it from the clean.  In my own xtend plug-ins, I have a .gitignore that ignores all of the generated Java files so that they won't be committed.  It also has the benefit of ensuring that a new check-out gets the xtend-gen/ folder in the first place.  :-)

Line:27, releng/top-pom-dev.xml -> What's the reason for this change?

Line:158, releng/top-pom-extras.xml -> Should this URL use the ${papyrus.eclipse.target} variable?

Line:572, releng/top-pom-extras.xml -> If the next profile is "nightly" then I suppose this comment is wrong?  or are these profiles related somehow?
