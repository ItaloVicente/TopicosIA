DESCRIPTION:

Bug 505330: Unable to post-process imported/migrated RSA-RTE model with proprietary profiles

Pre-process the model resources being imported to find automatic
XML namespace mappings for profiles that were dynamic (with schema
locations) in RSA but in Papyrus are registered EMF packages.

Use those mappings to resolve the registered factories for stereotype
applications and the references to the UML profile and its Ecore
representation in profile applications during the initial conversion
phase, then in the dependencies phase flip over to using the Papyrus
registered UML profile URIs for updating the profile applications.

All of this needs to account for the fact that these profile mappings
are potentially shared amongst multiple resource-sets that are
concurrently importing RSA models and then also multiple model-sets
that are concurrently fixing up dependencies, possibly even overlapping
with other jobs still in the first phase.  So, there is a lot going on
in the ProfileNamespaceHelper to accommodate all of those interactions
safely.  Hopefully the impact on import performance will be minimal,
as this should mostly be about initialization of metadata cached by
EMF, that these code paths aren't executed, say, every time an object
tries to resolve a proxy.

There were two problems with the first patch:

* I misunderstood the usage of the URI mappings maintained by the DependencyAnalysisHelper.  The ProfileNamespaceHelper added mappings for profiles that it thought it found (such as DefaultProfile and UMLRealTime), but the mappings should only be for unresolved profiles.  So, I the ProfileNamespaceHelper no longer adds any mappings

* the previous patch did not account for the fact that namespace declarations for profiles such as Today may only appear in EFX files, not in the root EMX, even though that is where the profile application typically is.  I think this is what caused the transaction exception.  This new patch properly accounts for fragments and with it I can no longer reproduce that exception
