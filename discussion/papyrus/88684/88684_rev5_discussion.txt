DESCRIPTION:

Bug 505330: Unable to post-process imported/migrated RSA-RTE model with proprietary profiles

Add an optional transformation extension interface for a new
post-processing phase invoked on the final imported model
after stereotype repair but before it is finally saved.

Also persist the basic import configuration parameters from
either the simple dialog or the wizard in the workspace metadata
area so that they will be the defaults for the next import.

I made a quick test of the latest patch-set, and the previous regressions seem to work, no exceptions and the profile applications seem to be correct (have not digged into exactly all details).

The new feature with persisting the options in the wizard was really nice. I had hoped that any changes in this area would implicitly fixed https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=505705 

Could you take a quick look at that one also, to see if you see something obvious that causes the dirty indicator to appear on the currently open model editor? The issue would happen more seldom now with the options being persisted, but still when it happens it is really confusing for the user (before I understood where that dirty indicator came from I was really, really puzzled each time it happened until I understood when/why it happened).

I guess Patrik needs to test this new post-processing phase and see how it works out.

Yes, I thought that would be more useful than changing the EMF model of the options to change the default number of threads and regenerate that code.  ;-)

Indeed, I was interested to discover today that the import dialog and wizard both use the Papyrus Properties View framework to present the UI for the import options.  This is why, for example, on Mac platform when using the import dialog you can only change the number of threads by hitting first the Help button before the OK button to dismiss the dialog.  This is a long-standing bug in the dialogs that use the Properties View framework.

But, also, the Properties View framework assumes that it is being used to edit properties of an object in the model open in the current editor, so I am not surprised that making changes in the import options would cause that editor to become dirty.  The import dialog and import wizard are probably using the active editor's command stack to execute changes in the import configuration "model".

This is definitely a bug in Papyrus, not Papyrus-RT.

Seems to work with two real life models.
