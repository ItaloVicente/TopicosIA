Solves the remaining dependency issues. It now takes 18 minutes to finish the dependency resolution (Including all the previous steps, such as cloning the repo & preparing the maven repo)

Unlike Patch Set 2, I used http:// urls in the target platforms instead of file:/. As far as I know, it is not possible to use variables in Target Platforms, so we can't really afford file:/ URLs. This would break the portability of the builds. One option would be to duplicate all TPs (One for Eclipse servers, and a portable one), but that would be a last resort solution. Using http instead of file:/ adds a lot of overhead to the dependency resolution step, as this is where artifacts are downloaded, so if we can solve this issue, the build would be much faster

These performance tests still happen on an overloaded server, so they are not accurate
