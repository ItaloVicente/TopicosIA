Patch Set 2:

24 minutes for Patch Set 2, including 7 minutes of dependency resolution. This is for a 'clean package' (Not so different from a 'clean verify' since we don't have tests anyway). 'clean compile' could be even faster, but it currently doesn't work (See Comment 3)

So Target Platforms seem to be a good candidate for speeding up the dependency resolution, by reducing the scope of the dependencies. It's a little bit harder to define and maintain, but it's mostly a one-shot work. Our current scripts can take care of updating the 21 P2 repositories that we need. For the specific IUs, they shouldn't change too often and can be updated manually (69 IUs in this complete TP, but this can possibly be reduced a little bit)

This patch set only provides a complete TP (Useful for Gerrit, but overkill for other jobs)
