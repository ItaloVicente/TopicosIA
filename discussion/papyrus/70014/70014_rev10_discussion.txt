25 minutes, including 10 minutes of initial download + dependency resolution

This was with the http:// protocol, so things might still get a little bit faster

Everything happens on a single Thread, except the Test Generation (Taking ~5 minutes), so this should scale properly with multiple parallel builds

Further optimization could include:

- Use file:/ protocol when building on Eclipse servers
- Do not wipe the Maven Repository for each build
- Exclude Test generation on Gerrit

The issue with wiping the Maven Repository is that it may result in a corrupt repository for Papyrus dependencies. For example, when alternating Mars builds, Neon builds and Feature Branch builds, as they do not share the same set of dependencies, we may find false-positive matches during dependency resolution. We've had many such problems in the past, until we used a clean Maven Repository for each build

Excluding the Test Generation would speed up things but will provide less accurate results. It's probably not necessary at this point
