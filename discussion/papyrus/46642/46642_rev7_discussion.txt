DESCRIPTION:

Bug 446865: lowerValue and upperValue cardinality values not accessible
through UI
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=446865

Correction of minor issues :
- The validation is still enabled for exotic multiplicities and reports
warnings (e.g. when typing 2..MAX, you will get a validation warning)
-> The validation correction was done on OCL validation but not on EMF
-> The EMF validation is managed by a new ValisationProvider which allow
to override existing validation constraint method

- When typing "*" in the Upper bound, using the XText Multiplicity
editor, the editor displays "null=*" (It may also happen for other
values, but it doesn't seem to be consistent)
-> Wrong test in Label Provider

- The Simple Multiplicity Editor doesn't properly refresh its read-only
state. If you switch from a Property [1..2] to a property [1..MAX], the
editor remains writable. Switching in the other direction, the editor
remains read-only
-> Need to refresh the read-only with the value refresh
-> Manage the ExtendedMultiplicityObservableValue with a support for the
dispose management
