DESCRIPTION:

Bug 446865: lowerValue and upperValue cardinality values not accessible
through UI
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=446865

Correction of minor issues :
- The validation is still enabled for exotic multiplicities and reports
warnings (e.g. when typing 2..MAX, you will get a validation warning)
-> The validation correction was done on OCL validation but not on EMF

- When typing "*" in the Upper bound, using the XText Multiplicity
editor, the editor displays "null=*" (It may also happen for other
values, but it doesn't seem to be consistent)
-> Wrong test in Label Provider

- The Simple Multiplicity Editor doesn't properly refresh its read-only
state. If you switch from a Property [1..2] to a property [1..MAX], the
editor remains writable. Switching in the other direction, the editor
remains read-only
-> Need to refresh the read-only with the value refresh

There are other issues related to refresh. When switching from a property (e.g. 2..MAX) to another one, and using the simple editor to define 1..2 for the new one, it is the previous one that is modified

PropertyEditors should support modification and update of all their fields, since they are not re-created when changing selection, if the selection is compatible

This should be checked and fixed for all properties of the multiplicity editor (Read only, IObservable, ContentProvider, ...)
Line:102, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.validation/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/validation/EValidatorAdapter.java -> Only the Lower/Upper constraint should be disabled. In this case, unrelated constraints on the same element will be ignored too

Also, the validation constraint for Upper bound should be handled in the same way than for Lower bound (Currently, lower bound is disabled for exotic multiplicities but upper bound validation is still verified)
