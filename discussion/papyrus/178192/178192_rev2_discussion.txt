DESCRIPTION:

Bug 570097: [Toolsmiths] Architecture Domains: Validation Builder

- give the Architecture Model Editor access to packages registered in the workspace
- support references to locally loaded element type configurations in the
  palette configuration editor

Enhancements to common plug-in builder framework:
- support checking for cross-referenced resources in the build.properties
- look up packages in the resource set's registry, not the shared instance
  (because Architecture Models are loaded in a resource set with workspace packages)
- support loading resources to be validated in a resource set with a custom
  package registry (again for Architecture Models)

- initial Architecture plug-in builder at parity (plus a bit) with the menu action

Fix problems found in test development:
- workspace-aware package registry doesn't get dynamic EPackages
- dependency checking doesn't check for bundle containing referenced icon
- custom model checker supertypes checking doesn't cross EPackage boundary
- missing check for reference icons' existence

- fix Architecture view to update when preferences are changed, especially
  to show contexts registered from models in the workspace
- fix the ArchitectureDomainManager API to report all registered model URIs,
  including from preferences (used by Architecture view and Load Resource
  dialog in the Architecture Model Editor)

Add validation of icon resources in Element Types Configurations models
as was done for Architecture Context models.
