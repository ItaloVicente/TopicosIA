Hi Guy,

The code in src-gen is generated using gmft-tooling, it's forbidden to change it manually.

in short: a commit can't change src-gen without changing the .gmfgen file

I will look fo someone using activity diagram regularly to test the patch.

Regards,
Benoit

Hi Guy,
I test this patch but I got a ClassCastException if the represent feature is something else than a ConnectableElement.

I have changed the location of 2 files to remove them from the scr-gen directory.
I would need some help on how to make the remaining 2 changes that are left in that src-gen directory be coming from the .gmfgen file.
Basically, in class ActivityPartitionNAmeEditPart, a condition needs to be added in the getLabelTextHelper method, and in ActivityPartitionEditPart, the refresh method needs to be overridden.

Line:126, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.activity/src-gen/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/activity/edit/helpers/ActivityPartitionLabelHelper.java -> Since an activity partition can represent "anything", i.e. an Element according to the UML specification, and not only ConnectableElement, I guess you should be able to reproduce this by selecting something else than a ConnectableElement, i.e. something else than ExtensionEnd, Parameter, Port, Property or Variable. I assume that if you let the activity partion represent an ordinary Class, that would trigger the issue. Please note though I have not tested this myself, I just happened to see this comment and wanted to provide feedback.

Hi Guy,

It's very important that you keep the same Gerrit Change-id otherwise you will create different patchset instead of itering on the same patchset.

Most tools provide a way to add the gerrit-it in the message comment (In eclipse it's the third button in Git staging view)

Is this one stil the correct patch ? Or should I look to https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/92196/?

Can you point me to the part of the norm that state that an Activity Partition should take the name of the element its represents?

Regards,
Benoit

I don't think that the UML specification actually states that the name of the represents element shall be included. Please also see the comment on https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=351865 (which is marked as a duplicate of https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=368888). I guess one reason why it cannot formally be defined in the UML specification is that the represents property is typed by Element (and not a NamedElement), and thus what the ActivityPartition represents does not necessarily always have a name (in most cases it have, but not necessarily always).

But it is still a useful feature to be able to let the name label of the activity partition pick up the name of the element (if it has a name) that it represents (the legacy tooling supports it for example). As proposed in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=368888, maybe this then needs to be controlled by a preference since it is not formally defined in the UML specification.
