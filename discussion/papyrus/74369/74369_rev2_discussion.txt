DESCRIPTION:

Bug 495279: [State Machine] Highest-priority provider prevents edit-part customization
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=495279

As in the Composite Structure Diagram, which works well for Papyrus-RT,
define only a single (@generated not) lowest-priority edit-part provider.  It declares all of the generated edit-parts and the custom
edit-part factory delegates to the generated factory for uncustomized
view types.

I think the usual pattern is to let the generated code as-is (With generated provider at lowest priority), then add the custom provider with a low priority. I see two benefits to this approach:

- You don't use generated="false", so there's a better separation between custom and generated code (Even though the changes are located in the same file, due to the monolithic nature of plugin.xml)
- It's easier if we ever need to simply remove the custom provider for whatever reason

Well, I followed the example of the Composite Structure Diagram here, which does the generated-not approach.  There are only five priorities.  I think it is not acceptable for the base diagram bundle that introduces two consume two priority levels on its own (at least it's not all five!).

It's not difficult on re-generation to twiddle the @generated tag back on, generate, and twiddle it off again and restore the custom provider class.

Or, enhance the code generator to allow customization of the provider class name in the GMFGen.

However it's done, I think the base implementation of a diagram must only have lowest priority providers.  That's how GMF was designed for extensibility.

Although, perhaps at this stage in the release it's just "safer" to go with the second provider at low priority.  At least it's better and can actually be overridden.

I'll raise a new general bug for Oxygen to change strategy across all diagrams.
