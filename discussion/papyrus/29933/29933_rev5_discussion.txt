DESCRIPTION:

437217: [Editors] In-place reloading of model resources in the editors
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=437217

In situ editor reloading.  Introduces an IReloadableEditor adapter
protocol with an implementation in the CoreMultiDiagramEditor that implements internal destruction of the ServicesRegistry and nested editors.  Some refactoring of the initialization and disposal code in the editor class hierarchy and dependencies facilitates reuse of init/dispose code in the reload scenario.  The re-loading of an editor is deferred until it is next activated, unless it is already the active editor (can happen when "Save All" is invoked).

Editor re-load notifications to dependent views like Model Explorer and Outline.  A new listener protocol informs dependents before and after reload so that they may properly dispose of obsolete state and re-initialize when the editor is reloaded.  Also ensure that an editor is only reloaded once when some resource that it depends on has changed, not once for each resource.

State restoration tokens.  Re-load listeners can insert tokens into the re-load event that capture state to be restored after the re-load. Listeners retrieve and apply these tokens after the editor re-loads itself.  Current state restoration includes:

- tree node expansion and selection state in the Model Explorer view
- diagram outline view: which presentation (tree or overview thumbnail) is active
- which workbench part is active, such that the correct selection is
reflected in views such as Model Explorer, Outline, and Properties
- current active diagram in the re-loaded editor
- edit-part selections in all diagrams
- selection (columns and rows, not individual cells) in table editors
- palettes in each diagram (or palette pages when the Palette View is open):
  * active tool
  * pinnable stack tool selection
  * drawer expansion state
  * drawer scroll position

The Palette View support incidentally fixes loss of palette state when switching between Papyrus editors, caused by the
PapyrusPaletteSynchronizer.

JUnit regression tests for various aspects of editor re-load.

Includes a fix for an NPE in the Validation View's content provider that occurs in several tests when an editor is closed or re-loaded.  Also support for tests that need to load more than one test-fixture model and/or open more than one editor.

Patch Set 5:

Patch set 5 iterates on the previous patch set, adding:

  * deferral of editor re-load to when the editor is next activated.
    If the dependent editor is dirty and the user elects to save it,
    it is saved immediately so that the user gets immediate feed-back
    that it is saved (by means of the asterisk decoration being removed).
    If the user opts not to save the dependent editor, then it is not
    saved but re-loading is deferred nonetheless.  The option to ignore
    a dirty editor altogether works as before

  * updates to the JUnit tests to account for deferral of the editor
    re-load, including a new test verifying that re-load is deferred

  * fixed a problem in the restoration of the palette states of
    diagrams when the Palette view is active (PapyrusPaletteSynchronizer
    doing stuff in the wrong sequence when at initialization and
    disposal)

This works fine

More testing will be required to identify remaining issues, and the best way for that is probably to merge it early. 

The only issue I have so far is with the read-only state, which is not restored (Make a library writable from model A; modify the library from the library's own editor; save the library; the library is now read-only in model A).

Thanks, Camille.  I really appreciate you wading through such a large change set, and I agree that there's plenty of soak time to shake out bugs (and a very good QA resource to find them!)

Good point about writable state.  I should be able to address that easily enough.
