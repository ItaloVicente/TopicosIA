DESCRIPTION:

Bug 480316 - [Codegen C++] Forward declaration

Repost of Shuai's changes, but aligned with refactoring done in Bug 484701

A complete rework of includes and declares in header and body.
The following rules are respected:

=== In header ===

* Include:
- All types of attributes that ARE NOT pointers or references
- All types of inline NON-NoCodeGen operation parameters that ARE NOT pointer or ref
- ALL types that are inner classifiers (not owned by a package)
- Recursively do the same for inner classifiers
- Interface realization, association, and template rules haven't changed

* Declare:
- All types of attributes that ARE pointers or references EXCEPT types that are inner classifiers (not owned by a package)
- All types of operation parameters...
- ...without types of inline NON-NoCodeGen operation parameters that ARE NOT pointer or ref (since they are included)
- All types of opaque behavior parameters without specification
- Recursively do the same for inner classifiers
- Template rules haven't changed

=== In body ===

* Include:
- All types of NON-inline and NON-NoCodeGen operation parameters that ARE NOT pointers or references
- All types of opaque behavior parameters without specification that ARE NOT pointers or references
- Recursively do the same for inner classifiers
- Dependency and template rule haven't changed

* Declare:
- We don't declare in body

Some other changes:

- Remove old getTypesViaAttributes (not used anywhere)
- Rename getOwnedAttributesTypes to getTypesViaAttributes
- Fix a lot of javadoc comments for the GenUtils methods
- Fix bug where classifiers included in cpp file are not generated when we want to generate code only for 1 classifier and its dependencies (e.g. right click on a class and generate code)
- Do not add namespace of undefined inner primitive type (i.e. no Typedef) in list of types to include/declare. Indeed in the code we generate 'MyPrimitive attr' instead of '::MyClass::MyPrimitive attr'
