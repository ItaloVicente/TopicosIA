Looks mostly good, but see some concerns in the in-line comments on the patch set.
Line:133, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/handler/CutHandler.java -> We're basically testing, here, whether the selection can be deleted (it is assumed that it can be copied).  Can we share this code with the DeleteHandler to avoid duplication? (promotes future evolution of the condition).  Also should share copyability condition with CopyHandler.

Line:134, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/handler/CutHandler.java -> What does this comment mean?  And is it a to-do?  It doesn't seem to be implemented ...

Line:156, plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/handler/CutHandler.java -> Can test this first before testing the selection contents.

Line:118, tests/junit/plugins/uml/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.modelexplorer.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/modelexplorer/tests/paste/CutPasteModelExplorerTest.java -> As in the patch set from change 26122, this selection is ambiguous as to why cut would be disabled.  I would suggest selecting some primitive type within the package so that we aren't trying to cut a root package (which case has its own test).
