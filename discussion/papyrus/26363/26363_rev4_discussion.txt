Thanks, Benoit!  It looks good.

Rather than follow up with some new comments, I just tweaked a couple of things:

 - List collection type is unnecessarily restrictive in the new method signatures
 - use the static wrap(...) methods for command wrappers to account for possible
    non-dirtying commands (which obviously wouldn't apply to delete commands,
    but it's still good practice)

- Yep better Collection than List
 - I didn't know the existence of this wrap method; I will use it next time

You also add supressWarning, is this a recommended practice for Papyrus ? 
I would prefer keep it until the gmf migration to 1.5.

I added that to clean up warnings in a method that I modified.

Does GMF have plans to migrate these APIs?  I would be surprised if so ...  In any case, if and when that happens, then there will be a new warning that the @SuppressWarnings annotation is unused.  :-)  But, I can revert that if you'd prefer it.
