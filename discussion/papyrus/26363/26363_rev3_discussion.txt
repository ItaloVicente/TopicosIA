File plugins/views/modelexplorer/org.eclipse.papyrus.views.modelexplorer/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/views/modelexplorer/handler/CutHandler.java:

Line 133: 	protected boolean computeEnabled() {
We're basically testing, here, whether the selection can be deleted (it is assumed that it can be copied).  Can we share this code with the DeleteHandler to avoid duplication? (promotes future evolution of the condition).  Also should share copyability condition with CopyHandler.
=> I have extracted 4 static methods  isCopy/DeleteEnabled and buidCopy/DeleteCommand

Line 134: 		//we need to test if selected element is not a meta-class
What does this comment mean?  And is it a to-do?  It doesn't seem to be implemented ...
No idea was already present in the DeleteHandler
=> I removed it, since it don't make sense (either for you or me)

Line 156: 		if(selectedElements.size() == 0) {
Can test this first before testing the selection contents.
=> Obviously, done

Line 118: 		//get read only item
As in the patch set from change 26122, this selection is ambiguous as to why cut would be disabled.  I would suggest selecting some primitive type within the package so that we aren't trying to cut a root package (which case has its own test).
=> Same code, done
