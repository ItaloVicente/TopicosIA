As discussed on the call today with Camille, rather than introduce a new model and content into the *.di resource, it would be nice to be able to rely on the presence of a Profile to indicate the language, especially because a single package may have content defined in multiple languages, and different packages in a single model may have content defined in different languages.  ProfileApplications really do define a meaningful scope.

However, I understand also that there is a problem of needing to be able to recognize that a language is employed in a resource before loading that resource.  To this end, I think we can use the general-purpose model indexing system provided by the WorkspaceModelindex API.  It makes it quite straight-forward to build an index of, for example, profile applications across the workspace that doesn't require loading resources into a ResourceSet.  The API encourages a non-blocking asynchronous style of queries (indexing runs as a background job), but for an editor needing to know about languages before loading resources, there is a synchronous query API also).

It is possible that the DecoratorModelIndex already indexes normal "internalized" profile applications as well as "externalized" applications, but I think not.  In any case, it is in the wrong plug-in for the ModelSet and its Models to access it.  But I think it could easily be extended to index internalized profile applications also and wired up as a data-provider to some API in a core plug-in for access by the editor.  Language support will need to account for externalized profile applications anyways ...

WDYT?

P.S.  I heard from a source that, for example, UML-RT "language" implies a custom implementation of the UMLPackage with different behaviour.  How is that supposed to work for mixed-language models?  Where some packages are UML-RT and some are not ...

I will continue this discussion on the bug 468030 (easier to access in the future)

UML-RT is this kind of profile which does not simply "annotates" an existing UML Model, but is actually "required" (Un-applying the profile changes the semantics of the Model). However it does play well with annotation profiles, for platform/language-specific code generation. But the UML-RT Profile/Stereotypes need to remain applied. In this specific case, it should "almost" be forbidden to externalize the UML-RT Profile. Unapplying the profile is a major refactoring with major impacts on the Model (From a semantics point of view)

Same thing for SysML; it defines a new language rather than an extension of UML
