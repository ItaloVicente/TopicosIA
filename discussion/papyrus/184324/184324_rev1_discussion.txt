Line:18, features/papyrus-main-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.siriusdiag.feature/feature.properties -> same here, 'Contains all the plugins' more than 'container ...' sounds better to me.

Line:18, features/papyrus-main-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.siriusdiag.feature/feature.properties -> same.

Line:22, features/papyrus-main-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.siriusdiag.feature/feature.xml -> if either of the features are not supposed to be isntalled/work independently, they should be depending on one another.

Line:18, features/papyrus-toolsmiths-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.sirius.feature/feature.properties -> I'd have worded that as: requires the Sirius plugins... etc

Line:18, features/papyrus-toolsmiths-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.sirius.feature/feature.properties -> I'd have worded that this way: Contains the toolsmiths plugins for the (Papyrus) Sirius diagrams integration plugins.

Line:23, features/papyrus-toolsmiths-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.sirius.feature/feature.xml -> Do you not need to add these requirements to the infra features as well ?

Line:25, features/papyrus-toolsmiths-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.sirius.feature/feature.xml -> same as above, are the toolsmiths supposed to be used as a standalone ?

Line:31, releng/main/site/category.xml -> I'd have added Integration but that may be unnecessary.

Line:37, releng/main/site/category.xml -> We discovered, again, that this is not enough if you want to 'feed' the update site to the installer (unless the binaries are already present in the releases aggregation).
If they are not (I believe they should be based on the simrel repo) you will have to add it through the jboss config in the releng pom.xml.

Line:18, features/papyrus-main-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.siriusdiag.feature/feature.properties -> Done

Line:18, features/papyrus-main-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.siriusdiag.feature/feature.properties -> Done

Line:22, features/papyrus-main-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.siriusdiag.feature/feature.xml -> Ack

Line:18, features/papyrus-toolsmiths-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.sirius.feature/feature.properties -> maybe done as you want...

Line:18, features/papyrus-toolsmiths-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.sirius.feature/feature.properties -> I didn't understand exactly what you want...

Line:23, features/papyrus-toolsmiths-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.sirius.feature/feature.xml -> I added the infra and uml siriusdiag feature because it seems more logic with them...

Line:25, features/papyrus-toolsmiths-features/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.sirius.feature/feature.xml -> ?

Line:31, releng/main/site/category.xml -> Integration ? or Incubation ?

Line:37, releng/main/site/category.xml -> that's true!
