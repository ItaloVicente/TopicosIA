Patch Set 1:

An earlier regression in the ClasspathHelper was detected by the UML Architecture Tests, in which validation of the UML Architecture Model failed because the ClasspathHelper didn't look in the host OSGi instance for the command classes when JDT was available (it would only search in the JDT classpath).

That was fixed by falling back to the ClassLoaderHelper case (looking for the class in the host instance) when a JDT project couldn't be found for the context URI of the class look-up. However, this then broke another case in which a look-up is done without such context and the whole JDT workspace needs to be searched. At least, it broken in the ClasspathHelper tests when running in the Maven build.

This patch attempts to fix that by ensuring both the fall-back to searching the whole workspace in case of no context URI and also making sure that the JDT environment and test projects are ready when running the tests in the Maven build.

Line:10, tests/junit/plugins/infra/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.tools.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> That's 2021-03, right? After all these years, I still haven't figured out how to (easily) install these staging JDT builds :)

Can we maybe use 3.24 instead?
