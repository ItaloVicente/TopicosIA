DESCRIPTION:

[Bug 453381, Bug 446572]: Label role in diagram UI: Correction for the UML sequence diagram.
Note that, although the gmfgen was updated appropriately in this contribution, I did not manage to re-generate the editor.
Instead, I modified the respective label edit part to add support for ILabelRoleProvider, by copy/paste of what was generated for other diagrams for which re-generation was successful.
Note2: I noticed that the different kinds of messages have 4 labels, only two of which I was able to identify and add support for in this contribution (name and stereotype). I suspect that the two remaining ones are related to sender/receiver message occurrences specifications, but it seems their implementation is currently incomplete in Papyrus, and I was not able to display any text for those two mysterious labels anyway.
