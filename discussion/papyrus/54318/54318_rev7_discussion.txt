DESCRIPTION:

[AOF] Fix NPEs in operations on primitive-valued EAttributes.

Fix exceptions in CollectBox operations on source box element types that are abstract, which cannot provide default instances for calculation of the result box's constraints.

[AOF] Add support for "unsettable" features in EMF models.

As the IOne API already provides for the concept of a "default" value, it makes sense to add API that lets clients query whether the one's value is what it is because it's defaulted or whether the value was explicitly set but happens to be the same as the default.

[AOF] The "constants" for empty boxes are mutable

Fix the mutability of the OPTION, ONE, SET, etc. fields of the IBox interface by introducing actual immutable box implementations and replacing these fields of IBox with emptyXyz() operations in a new Boxes class analogous to java.util.Collections.

Also add utility API for creating immutable boxes from other boxes and from source elements.  Remove the ConstantOne class that is made redundant by general support for immutable boxes.

[AOF] More client-friendly observable API

Widen the type bounds for observers attached to an observable. Follow the industry-standard pattern for observers by ignoring attempts to repeatedly add observers and attempts to remove observers that are not present, instead of throwing exceptions.

[AOF] List-feature box delegate add/remove notifications broken

Fix list-feature box delegate handling of EMF ADD_MANY and REMOVE_MANY notifications, which failed to properly account for the insertion and removal indices respectively and which, in the ADD_MANY case, would also remove an element because of a missing break statement.

[AOF] Add support for one-way bindings

Add API to the IBinding to set the binding to automatically disable itself on detection of a change to the left-hand side (target of the right-to-left binding).  This then prevents left-to-right change propagation and also subsequent overriding of left-hand side by changes to the right-hand side.  The binding can, of course, be re-enabled at any time for right-to-left synchronization (and auto-disable can be turned off at any time, too).

[AOF] Support POJOs in the AOFFactory

The initial implementation of the AOFFactory supported only Java classes whose properties are natively of IBox type.  To support integration of POJO types into the AOF, adapters should be provided for properties of simple scalar and collection types.

[AOF] Allow redundant collection operations

It is standard practice for collections in Java to allow redundant add and remove operations:  adding an already-present element to an unique collection should simply ignore the request and removing an element that is not in the collection should similarly be ignored.

[AOF] Fix problems with metaclasses and list features for EMF

IMetaClass instances from different platforms/domains should not be
comparable by isSubTypeOf(...) but neither should this method throw an
exception.  The result should just always be false for mixed platforms.

The box delegate for EMF list features had two problems (really two
consequences of the same issue):

* the backing-store was not kept up-to-date when changes occurred in
  list from the EMF side, if no client had registered any IObserver

* bindings that should fail catastrophically appeared to work:  direct
  binding of two containment lists, or reference lists with opposites,
  should fail because the lists cannot possibly be made to have the
  same contents

Both of these problems are fixed by ensuring that the adapter that
maintains the backing-store in the ListFeatureDelegate is always active.
And the implementation is slightly streamlined by removing a level of
indirection: delegating directly to a ListDelegate, not to a Box that
delegates to a ListDelegate.

Patch Set 7:

Fix two more problems in support of UML-RT synchronization:

The exceptions thrown by IMetaClass::isSubTypeOf(...) are unnecessary and don't correspond to the usual Java semantics.  Just as such comparisons between Classes from different ClassLoaders simply return false instead of bombing, so should comparison between AOF meta-classes from different domains/platforms.

The box delegate for EMF list features was broken as long as no observers were attached to it:  the backing-store was not kept up-to-date when changes occurred in the list from the EMF side.  This also hid problems in operations on containment references and references that have opposites, where lists change as side-effects of other changes.
