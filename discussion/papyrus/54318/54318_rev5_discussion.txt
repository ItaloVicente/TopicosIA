DESCRIPTION:

[AOF] Fix NPEs in operations on primitive-valued EAttributes.

Fix exceptions in CollectBox operations on source box element types that
are abstract, which cannot provide default instances for calculation of
the result box's constraints.

[AOF] Add support for "unsettable" features in EMF models.

As the IOne API already provides for the concept of a "default" value,
it makes sense to add API that lets clients query whether the one's
value is what it is because it's defaulted or whether the value was
explicitly set but happens to be the same as the default.

[AOF] The "constants" for empty boxes are mutable

Fix the mutability of the OPTION, ONE, SET, etc. fields of the IBox
interface by introducing actual immutable box implementations and
replacing these fields of IBox with emptyXyz() operations in a new
Boxes class analogous to java.util.Collections.

Also add utility API for creating immutable boxes from other boxes and
from source elements.  Remove the ConstantOne class that is made
redundant by general support for immutable boxes.

[AOF] More client-friendly observable API

Widen the type bounds for observers attached to an observable. Follow
the industry-standard pattern for observers by ignoring attempts to
repeatedly add observers and attempts to remove observers that are not
present, instead of throwing exceptions.

[AOF] List-feature box delegate add/remove notifications broken

Fix list-feature box delegate handling of EMF ADD_MANY and REMOVE_MANY
notifications, which failed to properly account for the insertion and
removal indices respectively and which, in the ADD_MANY case, would also
remove an element because of a missing break statement.

[AOF] Add support for one-way bindings

Add API to the IBinding to set the binding to automatically disable
itself on detection of a change to the left-hand side (target of the
right-to-left binding).  This then prevents left-to-right change
propagation and also subsequent overriding of left-hand side by changes
to the right-hand side.  The binding can, of course, be re-enabled at
any time for right-to-left synchronization (and auto-disable can be
turned off at any time, too).

[AOF] Support POJOs in the AOFFactory

The initial implementation of the AOFFactory supported only Java classes
whose properties are natively of IBox type.  To support integration of
POJO types into the AOF, adapters should be provided for properties of
simple scalar and collection types.
