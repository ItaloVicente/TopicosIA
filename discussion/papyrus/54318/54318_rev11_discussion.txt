DESCRIPTION:

Bug 476683: [AOF Sync] Investigate/prototype diagram-to-diagram synchronization on AOF https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=476683

[AOF] Precise factory tracking

Boxes and operations need to know the factory that created them
so that they may use the correct factory to create further boxes
and operations.  Also because the factory denotes the platform
or domain of the model elements in the boxes, which clients may
need to interrogate in some box.

[AOF] Observer tracking for undo of set-up of operations

Add a facility for tracking the attachment of observers to observables to later clean them up, so that observed objects may have active operations easily removed to undo the establishment of those operations.

[AOF] Improving test coverage and tweaks for diagram synchronization

[AOF] Support for one-way initial-value bindings

Add a new active operation to implement one-way conditional bindings, in particular for the use case of initial-value bindings.  These are bindings to a box that fire only when the box has no value yet, to provide an initial value that wasn't available at the time of creation of the box.

[AOF] Refactorings for reuse of test utilities from master branch.

[AOF] Fix problems with metaclasses and list features for EMF

IMetaClass instances from different platforms/domains should not be comparable by isSubTypeOf(...) but neither should this method throw an exception.  The result should just always be false for mixed platforms.

The box delegate for EMF list features had two problems (really two consequences of the same issue):

* the backing-store was not kept up-to-date when changes occurred in
  list from the EMF side, if no client had registered any IObserver

* bindings that should fail catastrophically appeared to work:  direct
  binding of two containment lists, or reference lists with opposites,
  should fail because the lists cannot possibly be made to have the
  same contents

Both of these problems are fixed by ensuring that the adapter that maintains the backing-store in the ListFeatureDelegate is always active. And the implementation is slightly streamlined by removing a level of indirection: delegating directly to a ListDelegate, not to a Box that delegates to a ListDelegate.

[AOF] Allow redundant collection operations

It is standard practice for collections in Java to allow redundant add and remove operations:  adding an already-present element to an unique collection should simply ignore the request and removing an element that is not in the collection should similarly be ignored.

[AOF] Support POJOs in the AOFFactory

The initial implementation of the AOFFactory supported only Java classes whose properties are natively of IBox type.  To support integration of POJO types into the AOF, adapters should be provided for properties of simple scalar and collection types.

[AOF] Add support for one-way bindings

Add API to the IBinding to set the binding to automatically disable itself on detection of a change to the left-hand side (target of the right-to-left binding).  This then prevents left-to-right change propagation and also subsequent overriding of left-hand side by changes to the right-hand side.  The binding can, of course, be re-enabled at any time for right-to-left synchronization (and auto-disable can be turned off at any time, too).

[AOF] List-feature box delegate add/remove notifications broken

Fix list-feature box delegate handling of EMF ADD_MANY and REMOVE_MANY notifications, which failed to properly account for the insertion and removal indices respectively and which, in the ADD_MANY case, would also remove an element because of a missing break statement.

[AOF] More client-friendly observable API

Widen the type bounds for observers attached to an observable. Follow the industry-standard pattern for observers by ignoring attempts to repeatedly add observers and attempts to remove observers that are not present, instead of throwing exceptions.

[AOF] The "constants" for empty boxes are mutable

Fix the mutability of the OPTION, ONE, SET, etc. fields of the IBox interface by introducing actual immutable box implementations and replacing these fields of IBox with emptyXyz() operations in a new Boxes class analogous to java.util.Collections.

Also add utility API for creating immutable boxes from other boxes and from source elements.  Remove the ConstantOne class that is made redundant by general support for immutable boxes.

[AOF] Add support for "unsettable" features in EMF models.

As the IOne API already provides for the concept of a "default" value, it makes sense to add API that lets clients query whether the one's value is what it is because it's defaulted or whether the value was explicitly set but happens to be the same as the default.

[AOF] Fix NPEs in operations on primitive-valued EAttributes.

Fix exceptions in CollectBox operations on source box element types that are abstract, which cannot provide default instances for calculation of the result box's constraints.

Patch Set 11:

Patch set 11 adds precise tracking of the IFactory that creates boxes, metaclasses, and operations.  This is primarily to ensure that when a box or an operation or a metaclass creates another box, it creates a box using the same factory, for consistency of the "platform" or "domain" semantics.  This is important in model-to-model mappings, especially when mapping across domains.  Also, it is useful for client code to be able to interrogate a box's factory to determine which domain it is from and to create, itself, other boxes and things from that domain.
