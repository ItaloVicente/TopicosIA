DESCRIPTION:

[AOF] Fix NPEs in operations on primitive-valued EAttributes.

Fix exceptions in CollectBox operations on source box element types that
are abstract, which cannot provide default instances for calculation of
the result box's constraints.

[AOF] Add support for "unsettable" features in EMF models.

As the IOne API already provides for the concept of a "default" value,
it makes sense to add API that lets clients query whether the one's
value is what it is because it's defaulted or whether the value was
explicitly set but happens to be the same as the default.

[AOF] The "constants" for empty boxes are mutable

Fix the mutability of the OPTION, ONE, SET, etc. fields of the IBox
interface by introducing actual immutable box implementations and
and replacing these fields of IBox with emptyXyz() operations in a new
Boxes class analogous to java.util.Collections.

Also add utility API for creating immutable boxes from other boxes and
from source elements.  Remove the ConstantOne class that is made
redundant by general support for immutable boxes.

[AOF] More client-friendly observable API

Widen the type bounds for observers attached to an observable.
Follow the industry-standard pattern for observers by ignoring attempts
to repeatedly add observers and attempts to remove observers that are
not present, instead of throwing exceptions.

[AOF] List-feature box delegate add/remove notifications broken

Fix list-feature box delegate handling of EMF ADD_MANY and REMOVE_MANY
notifications, which failed to properly account for the insertion and
removal indices respectively and which, in the ADD_MANY case, would
also remove an element because of a missing break statement.

[AOF] Add support for one-way bindings

Add API to the IBinding to set the binding to automatically disable
itself on detection of a change to the left-hand side (target of the
right-to-left binding).  This then prevents left-to-right change
propagation and also subsequent overriding of left-hand side by changes
to the right-hand side.  The binding can, of course, be re-enabled at
any time for right-to-left synchronization (and auto-disable can be
turned off at any time, too).

Patch Set 4:

I've abandoned (literally) the attempt to post separate Gerrit reviews for each discrete bug that I'm fixing in the AOF.  The first couple of Gerrit changes worked fine, but I cannot push any more (the server responds with an error when I try to push new changes).

So, this Gerrit review will now accumulate all further changes, until it is reviewed and merged.

From review 54554:

The GMF Notation model has a peculiar structure in the View::element reference, which is "unsettable" in the EMF feature sense of supporting a separate "unset" state and which has a default value that is derived from the element references of the parent view chain.

To support AOF bindings and other operations on such references, the AOF needs to support this "unset" state explicitly.  As the EMF implementation of the AOF represents all scalar features as IOnes, and as the IOne interface already provides a default value, it seemed useful to add an "isDefault" API to IOne in order to let clients know when the box's value is defaulted.  The EMF implementation of the IOne for scalar features takes account of the unset state and exposes it in this new API.  The One class and its delegate likewise provide the default state for other domains.

New JUnit tests are included for simple scenarios in the EMF domain and the core AOF.

From review 54635:

The IBox.OPTION and similar "constants" are not actually constant at all, because they are mutable boxes.  Client code can accidentally add elements to these boxes such that they will not longer be empty.

This patch remedies the problem by introducing a general facility for immutable boxes.  A new Boxes utility class, analogous to java.util.Collections, adds true constants for empty boxes, as well as convenience API for construction of other immutable boxes.
Other new utility APIs in support of the immutable boxes are

* a proper Java enum (supporting switch statements) for the kinds of constraints
*EMF-like switch utilities for IConstraints and IBox

Includes complete test coverage.

From review 54636:

The IObservable APIs for adding and removing observers are too restrictive of the observer type (because IObserver is parameterized).  This patch remedies that, as well as the throwing of exceptions in that adding and removal of observers that runs contrary to the prevailing design pattern.

Existing JUnit tests are adjusted accordingly.

New bug fixes:

Fix list-feature box delegate handling of EMF ADD_MANY and REMOVE_MANY notifications, which failed to properly account for the insertion and removal indices respectively and which, in the ADD_MANY case, would also remove an element because of a missing break statement.  Also ignore touch notifications so that bindings and other active operations don't fire needlessly (IObservers getting notified of non-changes, generally).

Add API to the IBinding to set the binding to automatically disable itself on detection of a change to the left-hand side (target of the right-to-left binding).  This then prevents left-to-right change propagation and also subsequent overriding of left-hand side by changes to the right-hand side.  This supports the UML-RT state-machine diagram synchronization requirement that the extending state machine should be able to adjust its layout to accommodate elements that aren't in the extended state machine, without having those layout changes overridden again from the parent.
