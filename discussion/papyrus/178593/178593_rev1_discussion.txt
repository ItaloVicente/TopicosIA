DESCRIPTION:

Bug 571125: [Toolsmith] Improve icon validation for toolsmith validation

- unify validation of icons referenced by model elements
- covers opaque resources of all kinds, not just icons:
  e.g., creation/conversion command classes in Architecture models
- covers resources referenced from model files and from plugin.xml

I don't understand how this change could have caused three new test failures in the canonical tests for Component Diagram and Timing Diagram.

Line:63, plugins/toolsmiths/validation/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.validation.elementtypes/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/toolsmiths/validation/elementtypes/internal/checkers/ElementTypesPluginChecker.java -> It's a bit off-topic, but: do you remember where these values came from? This comment has been added in 173664 (https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/papyrus/org.eclipse.papyrus/+/173664), but it seems to indicate that these values have been copied from somewhere else.

For Element Types, these (commented out) dependencies make sense, as they'll be required at runtime; although it's a very indirect dependency.

Line:63, plugins/toolsmiths/validation/org.eclipse.papyrus.toolsmiths.validation.elementtypes/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/toolsmiths/validation/elementtypes/internal/checkers/ElementTypesPluginChecker.java -> These were in the original implementation of the plug-in checker for Element Types Configurations models. I commented them out when I implemented the expanded toolsmiths validation for Element Types Configurations some time ago.

I commented these out then because they aren't needed as direct dependencies. They are either (on a case by case basis)

* indirect requirements of bundles that are needed as direct dependencies, or
* only needed if the model defines UML-based types, or
* not actually needed to register the Element Types Configurations model

So specifying them in the manifest is redundant and can lead to wiring problems if the dependency versions aren't correctly maintained, which can easily happen because of Papyrus's dictum against re-exports.

(note that some of these may be needed for the implementation of edit-helper advice in the host plug-in, but then the developer will be adding them anyways to access their Java APIs)

I've modified an icon reference in an architecture model (from domain.gif to domain.png), to force an error, and it seems it is detected twice (apparently from 2 different validators, as the message is slightly different):

No such icon 'domain.png' in 'Domain Systems Engineering'.	sysml16.architecture
No such icon resource 'domain.png' in Domain Systems Engineering.	sysml16.architecture

Also, I'm getting a lot of errors regarding the Creation Commands (Although I didn't change anything in the model, and the commands seem valid to me):

Creation command of 'SysML 1.6 :: SysML 1.6 Activity Diagram' does not implement the ICreationCommand interface.	sysml16.architecture
Creation command of 'SysML 1.6 :: SysML 1.6 Block Definition Diagram' does not implement the ICreationCommand interface.	sysml16.architecture
Creation command of 'SysML 1.6 :: SysML 1.6 Internal Block Diagram' does not implement the ICreationCommand interface.	sysml16.architecture
Creation command of 'SysML 1.6 :: SysML 1.6 Package Diagram' does not implement the ICreationCommand interface.	sysml16.architecture
Creation command of 'SysML 1.6 :: SysML 1.6 Parametric Diagram' does not implement the ICreationCommand interface.	sysml16.architecture
Creation command of 'SysML 1.6 :: SysML 1.6 Requirement Diagram' does not implement the ICreationCommand interface.	sysml16.architecture
Creation command of 'SysML 1.6 :: SysML 1.6 Sequence Diagram' does not implement the ICreationCommand interface.	sysml16.architecture
Creation command of 'SysML 1.6 :: SysML 1.6 State Machine Diagram' does not implement the ICreationCommand interface.	sysml16.architecture
Creation command of 'SysML 1.6 :: SysML 1.6 Use Case Diagram' does not implement the ICreationCommand interface.	sysml16.architecture

It is worth noting that, for SysML 1.6, I use a very chaotic (yet typical :) ) development environment, where some plug-ins are installed, some are used as sources from Git in a first Eclipse Instance, and I'm importing the SysML 1.6 source plug-ins from a nested Eclipse Instance (I don't have any source Papyrus plug-in in this nested instance; only SysML). SysML reuses the Creation Commands from Papyrus Diagrams, so they should be valid. I also added all the missing dependencies in the Architecture plug-in's Manifest, so it doesn't seem to simply be a Classpath issue.

Ah, looks like I didn't remove the Architecture builder's custom validation rule for icons? Will check.

This could be related to the regression in the ClasspathHelper which fix is still waiting to be merged. I'll see whether I can emulate your set-up to reproduce this. I try to avoid chaos in my dev environments, so I probably missed something! 😀
