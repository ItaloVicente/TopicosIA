DESCRIPTION:

Bug 571125: [Toolsmith] Improve icon validation for toolsmith validation

- unify validation of icons referenced by model elements
- covers opaque resources of all kinds, not just icons:
  e.g., creation/conversion command classes in Architecture models
- covers resources referenced from model files and from plugin.xml
- add calculation of required bundle dependencies from command-class
  features that are constrained to implement some interface, the bundle
  providing that interface type being a required dependency. This helps
  to diagnose problems in resolving commands when the JDT classpath
  of the architecture bundle does not include the required interface
