DESCRIPTION:

Bug 571125: [Toolsmith] Improve icon validation for toolsmith validation

- unify validation of icons referenced by model elements
- covers opaque resources of all kinds, not just icons:
  e.g., creation/conversion command classes in Architecture models
- covers resources referenced from model files and from plugin.xml
- add calculation of required bundle dependencies from command-class
  features that are constrained to implement some interface, the bundle
  providing that interface type being a required dependency. This helps
  to diagnose problems in resolving commands when the JDT classpath
  of the architecture bundle does not include the required interface

Patch Set 2:

Patch set 2 fixes both problems. Firstly, I had removed the custom validation rule for icons from the Element Types Configurations builder only, not the Architecture builder.

On the matter of the failure to resolve diagram creation command classes in SysML 1.6, this was caused by the SysML architecture bundle not having the 'ICreationCommand' interface on its classpath. The reason for that is the architecture bundle not having the org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.commands bundle in its dependencies.

So, this is addressed by on the one hand including a note in the problem messages indicating that the required interface may not be implemented because of a missing bundle dependency and on the other hand computing required bundle dependencies inferred by the interface constraints of command classes set in the model. When the developer adds the missing dependency thus reported, then the other command-class problems go away also.

Test failures not different to the baseline results from the master branch tests.
