DESCRIPTION:

Bug 571125: [Toolsmith] Improve icon validation for toolsmith validation

- unify validation of icons referenced by model elements
- covers opaque resources of all kinds, not just icons:
  e.g., creation/conversion command classes in Architecture models
- covers resources referenced from model files and from plugin.xml
- add calculation of required bundle dependencies from command-class
  features that are constrained to implement some interface, the bundle
  providing that interface type being a required dependency. This helps
  to diagnose problems in resolving commands when the JDT classpath
  of the architecture bundle does not include the required interface

Patch Set 7:

Patch set 7 updates the warning message reported in case the command class exists but cannot be determined to implement the required interface to indicate which specific bundle dependency is missing.

The plug-in builder already incorporates the bundle dependency implied by the command interface in its reporting of missing bundle dependencies, with a quick fix. So I think point #3 is covered, also.

I don't think there's much else that we can do. When the bundle providing the command class is in the PDE Target and it doesn't re-export the dependency that defines the interface, PDE just doesn't give the JDT classpath visibility of the types from packages that are not re-exported. There is no JDT model that will be able to connect the command class to the required interface.

Indeed; I was only checking the EMF Model Validation. When activating the Papyrus builder, additional errors are reported; and the quickfixes for these errors also solve the EMF Validation problem. So, it works for me!
