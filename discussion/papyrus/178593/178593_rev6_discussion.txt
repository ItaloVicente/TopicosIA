DESCRIPTION:

Bug 571125: [Toolsmith] Improve icon validation for toolsmith validation

- unify validation of icons referenced by model elements
- covers opaque resources of all kinds, not just icons:
  e.g., creation/conversion command classes in Architecture models
- covers resources referenced from model files and from plugin.xml
- add calculation of required bundle dependencies from command-class
  features that are constrained to implement some interface, the bundle
  providing that interface type being a required dependency. This helps
  to diagnose problems in resolving commands when the JDT classpath
  of the architecture bundle does not include the required interface

Patch Set 6:

The changes looks good to me. I'm not fully satisfied with the current ICreationCommand behavior, though :) I think it can still be improved a bit.

I used uml.architecture as an example (Using the current Nightly + this Gerrit patch), with the following steps:

- Start a runtime instance of Eclipse with this Gerrit patch applied
- Import org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.architecture in the runtime workspace
- Validate uml.architecture

If the referenced uml.diagram plug-ins are not part of the runtime workspace, the validation will complain about invalid ICreationCommands:

> Creation command of 'UML :: Activity Diagram' does not implement the ICreationCommand interface. This may be caused by a missing bundle dependency.
> ...

- Import all plug-ins from uml.diagram.*
- Validate uml.architecture again

The validation now succeeds

I have a few issues with this:

1) The behavior is inconsistent depending on how the uml diagram plug-ins are referenced
2) The error message suggests that there may be a "missing bundle dependency", which can be a bit frustrating. We should at least explicitly check for the presence of org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.commands, as it's the one that is most likely missing.
3) It would be nice to have a quickfix for this, as finding the correct missing dependency can be quite tricky, especially for people that aren't expert with Eclipse classpath management :) (But it's probably difficult, as we only reference the class by Qualified Name, so the validator doesn't know where to search either. Using the classpath of the bundle that contains the command class would help us identifying the correct class hierarchy, and then find which dependencies may be missing, but the architecture model doesn't contain this information).

It is only a problem because of the Papyrus anti-reëxport policy. JDT doesn't see that the bundle providing the ICreationCommand interface is in the classpath because it isn't re-exported by the bundle that exposes it in its own API.

> 2) The error message suggests that there may be a "missing bundle dependency", which can be a bit frustrating. We should at least explicitly check for the presence of org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.commands, as it's the one that is most likely missing.

But in this case, adding that dependency fixes the problem and the model validates cleanly. So, from that perspective, it is a "correct" message. 😀 But I agree that it would be useful to identify the bundle in question. I think we can do that via the model annotations that tells us about the interface in the first place. Will do this.

I think when #2 is addressed to identify the missing dependency, I can do this, too!
