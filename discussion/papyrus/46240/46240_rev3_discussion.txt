The use of EMF reflection is good, thanks.

But there are two blocking issues (see file comments).
Line:19, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Missing bundle-version attribute.

File Comment: plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/lib/uml.graph.uml2graph-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar -> This must be an Eclipse bundle in the Papyrus git repository that is deployed as a regular plug-in at run-time, not a nested JAR.  The Mars release has only one source repository.

Especially because nested JAR, this repeats all of the Apache logging, EMF, and UML2 binaries that are already deployed as bundles in Papyrus.
Line:2, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/dnd/messages/messages.properties -> That's a very long menu item label.  I'd suggest just "Create new reception"

Line:79, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/dnd/signal2reception/SignalToReceptionDropStrategy.java -> Many kinds of classifier cannot own receptions: at least UseCase, Actor, Association, the DataTypes, Signal (!).  I think that in those cases the strategy will provide a command that has no effect.  A command should only be provided if it will create a reception.

Line:100, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/dnd/signal2reception/SignalToReceptionDropStrategy.java -> What is a path?  Either the classifier can own receptions, or it can't.  Why aren't we just looking for a containment reference of some supertype of Reception?

If a path is a sequence of references to some other object reachable from the drop target, then I think the result of the drop would be surprising (at best) to the user.  For example, if I drop a Signal onto a Use Case, I would *not* expect that if the Use Case happens to have a subject that is a Class that this subject then has a reception created for the signal.

(but I'm speculating on what might be the intention, because I can't see this UML graph services code)

The provided jar transforms the uml meta model into a bipartite graph where nodes are EClass and edges the ereferences.
The idea is to develop one drop strategy able to catch many drop commands.
The proof of concept has already done and works.
By doing so I am able to generate many drop commands by just looking into the uml metamodel.

The bug you detected in test environment was just because I have missed a details: I provide strategy even if they hold no command. Camille has solved that point.

for now is holiday time, I will be back in one week to improve the code with your advice

Hey Christian
here some answers to your questions
I still need help to build an osgi eclipse compatible bundle.
If you have any suggestion.
Thanks
Francois
Line:19, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Done

Line:2, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/dnd/messages/messages.properties -> Done

Line:79, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/dnd/signal2reception/SignalToReceptionDropStrategy.java -> I have linked it to
if (!(targetElement instanceof org.eclipse.uml2.uml.Class))

Line:100, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.dnd/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/dnd/signal2reception/SignalToReceptionDropStrategy.java -> Hello
the uml graph service code is located here:
org.eclipse.papyrus.tools/uml.graph

it is linked to the gerrit
https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/46443/2

this initial implementation will filter path given a strict name.

because in the next move, I will upgrade (not break) the api for drag and drop in order to manage multicommands per strategy.

Francois
