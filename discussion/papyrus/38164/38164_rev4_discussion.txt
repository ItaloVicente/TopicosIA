Remi, I believe everything is right in the suggested removal of the old preferences pages above, at least there is nothing like that for other diagrams. 

But in case if you know why this code had been there at the first place, I would like to specifically raise your attention to this removal.

Preference Pages for Diagram Appearance have been replaced with CSS Themes, so they should indeed be removed. They have been removed from the templates in Luna, but the Activity Diagram has not been properly regenerated since then. So, everything's fine
