Line:146, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.log/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/log/LogHelper.java -> Why this change?  Now the cost of synchronization (both in basic monitor operations and in thread contention) is incurred on every call, regardless of whether tracing is globally enabled.  This code specifically avoided that overhead, before.

Line:234, plugins/infra/core/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/sasheditor/internal/PagePart.java -> I'm fairly certain that this case was needed in my testing.  It was there by design.  Why delete it?

Line:167, plugins/infra/emf/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf.gmf/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/emf/gmf/util/OperationHistoryDirtyState.java -> Probably this should be delegated in the same way as equals.

Line:20, plugins/infra/emf/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I don't think this is necessary, and it has a pretty wide downstream impact.  This patch doesn't make any incompatible changes and none are reported by the build:

https://hudson.eclipse.org/papyrus/view/Oxygen%20(Master)/job/Papyrus-Master-Developer/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/apireports/html/api.html

If this is reverted to 2.2, then the up-versioning of some other bundles that re-export this one (e.g., org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.ui.emf), will have to be reverted, too, except where they have their own API-breaking changes.
