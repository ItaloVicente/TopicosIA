I don't understand.  Are we reverting to the pre-Neon policy of simply updating all bundles versions to the same number regardless of whether it makes sense for each?  I thought we had changed in Neon (and subsequently) to implementing the Eclipse bundle versioning guidelines?  A lot of work went into conformance to those guidelines.

This contribution is somewhat misleading. Sorry. The initial point was to address Bug 443799 which triggered the need to change the version number of many plugins in Papyrus by strictly applying Eclipse policy for version increment. 
Unfortunately I arbitrarily incremented the feature versions to 3.0.0 while I should distinguish those that must be incremented and those that don’t have to. 
Nevertheless for the plugins version, the Eclipse policy has been applied strictly with Neon Nightly as baseline and should therefore be correct.

Okay, thanks.  It looked to me as though every bundle in existence had its version updated because there are so many manifests and POMs changed in this patch, besides a large number of other files.  And many files deleted!  Is that all FindBugs warnings?

All the deleted files come from warnings from FindBugs directly or indirectly. Some files are deleted because fixing a bug identified by findbugs revealed dead code.
