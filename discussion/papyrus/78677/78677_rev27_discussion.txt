Regarding org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.sasheditor.internal.PagePart.canClose(), I reverted my change but "closeable == this" remains strange because pointer comparison is discouraged and "this" and "closeable" have "EC_UNRELATED_CLASS_AND_INTERFACE" so equality seems to be impossible.

Thanks, Florian.  I recall that I added this case deliberately because it solved a problem in my testing of the Welcome Page feature.  And this unrelated-types warning seems bogus to me because of course there can be a subtype of PagePart that implements the ICloseablePart interface.  The canClose() method is an instance method, so 'this' is polymorphic.  The warning is just wrong.
