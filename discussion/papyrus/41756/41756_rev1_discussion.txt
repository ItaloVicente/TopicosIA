DESCRIPTION:

Bug 459746: Model remains dirty after save and undo
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=459746

Ensure that, when the undo history is exhausted and we save again, we forget
the save context because now it's as though we're starting afresh with a new
command history.  This lets the isSaveNeeded method rely on the presence of
the save marker to know that we're dirty in the case that there is no more undo.

Wouldn't this break the "Redo" history then?

The change made originally to fix the problem of save not clearing the dirty state of the editor when the undo history was exhausted was not the right fix.  The problem was that when there is no undo context, the presence of the save-context marker is misleading.  But the correct fix in that case is to remove the save context if save happens when there is no undo history, because now it's as though we've started with a fresh command history on opening the editor.

No, because if you start redoing commands from this point, it's just like executing new commands.  The undo history piles up and because there's no save point recorded, the stack knows that it's dirty.

I should have mentioned that I did test scenarios like this:

1. Do, do, do.  (dirty)
2. Save. (not dirty)
3. Undo, undo, undo.  (dirty)
4. Save. (not dirty)
5. Redo, redo, redo to where we had saved at step 2.  (dirty)
6. Save. (not dirty)

Of course, I should have included JUnit tests before.  Now I do.

If you revert the NotifyingWorkspaceCommandStack class to its state before the changes introduced to fix 410310, then the following test fails:

* notDirtyAfterExecute_save_undo_save

as expected (that problem is bug 410310).  Now if you re-apply the changes that were made to fix 410310, you get this test failure:

* dirtyAfterExecute_save_undo (this is bug 459746)
* notDirtyAfterExecute_save_undo_save
* dirtyAfterExecute_save_undo_save_redo
* dirtyAfterExecute_save_execute_undo_undo_save_redo

The latter three all fail because of an attempt to save a command-stack that doesn't think it's dirty.
