DESCRIPTION:

Bug 474467: Papyrus editors title do not update when their label change

Add support for propagation of label-provider change events for labels
that are dependent on other elements' labels.  Implement such a
dependent label for Diagrams that have no names of their own.

This patch adds support for the propagation of label-provider change events from the EMF item providers that the Papyrus common label provider (viz. EMFLabelProvider) delegates to for labels.  Also propagation of label-provider change events for the labels of elements that are used in the calculation of derived labels (this is the new DependentEMFLabelProvider class).

To simulate the Papyrus-RT scenario of derived diagram names for diagrams that don't have explicit names, the NotationLabelProvider now is a kind of DependentEMFLabelProvider that computes a label based on the label of the context element when a diagram doesn't have its own name.

JUnit tests are added to cover the new core label-provider APIs and the enhancements to the NotationLabelProvider, including the notification scenarios.

I had thought to update the ExtensibleLabelProvider used by the service to forward isLabelProperty(...) calls to the contributed filtered label providers, but there seems little point in that since I discovered that EMF's item-providers don't support this concept and the AdapterFactoryLabelProvider doesn't properly implement the isLabelProperty(...) API.
