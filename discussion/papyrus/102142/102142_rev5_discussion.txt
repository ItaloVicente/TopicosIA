DESCRIPTION:

Bug 435352 - [Property view] Attribute selection takes way too long

- Only refresh the currently active tree-viewer
  - avoid unnecessary refreshs
  - make sure that the tab contents from the graphical EMF provider is only added, when
    the associated tree viewer is selected.

- The flat tree viewer has a filter field that commits on focus lost (in EMFGraphicalContentProvider).
  This introduces a longer delay since the commit updates the filter and is followed by a refresh. The
  commit is now only done, if the filter pattern has changed. The filter field was initially empty,
  with the patch, it contains the default value ("*")
