degeneracy of the bounds/client-area of the lifeline figures.

This update creates a separate polygon for hit detection on the lifeline figure that includes a buffer zone around the lifeline stem.  Hit detection doesn't require augmentation of this polygon with execution specifications, which is only needed for the attachment of connections.

I am preparing also a separate patch for the master branch, as this seems orthogonal to the purpose of this feature branch.

I don't understand this part. The creation of nested execution specification only works on Lifelines, not actual top-level exec specs. So starting with 3 levels of nesting, it is really hard to create a new execution specification (Because the first two levels of ExecSpec overlap with the only area where we could create new ones). The 4th level exec spec can only be created by aiming to the other side of the Lifeline (On the right side, the first 3 levels completely hide the selectable lifeline area)

Messages are OK now

You're right.  I forgot that the executions don't re-target creation of executions to the lifeline.  Let's see what I can do about that.
