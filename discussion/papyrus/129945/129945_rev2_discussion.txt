degeneracy of the bounds/client-area of the lifeline figures.

> Uploaded patch set 2.

This fixes the regression of the combined-fragment selection scenario, for which the responsive bounds of a lifeline figure were reduced in the first place.  Now we require the user actually to click on the lifeline head or stem, or on any execution specification, with a fuzzy affordance that it needn't be an exact strike.  This is evidenced in the necessity of updating a state-invariant creation test to target more narrowly the lifeline stem.

Line:31, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/figures/FigureHitTestUtil.java -> This uses to be 20px around the body; 2 is significantly too low when trying to (quickly) connect messages to a lifeline without using ExecSpecs. It also makes it difficult to create Nested Exec specs. I've increased the value to 20 on the X axis, which feels much more comfortable
