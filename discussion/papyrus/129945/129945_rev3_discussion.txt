The 2 factor makes a 5x5 square that we test for overlap with the lifeline shape.  The problem with a 40x5 rectangle is that it also is applied to the lifeline head, so if lifeline heads are close together, you could end up selecting a lifeline when clicking directly on its neighbour.

I would rather find a way to widen the target area of the lifeline stem only if we aren't satisfied with the 5x5 mouse pointer.

Good point; the selection area should only be widen around the body area (and their execution specifications)

So maybe that requires a slightly more complex algorithm, specific to the lifeline shape
