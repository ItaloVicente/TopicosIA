DESCRIPTION:

Bug 570486: [Architecture] Architecture model shall clearly define merge and inherit concepts

- implement new architecture domain merger with support for legacy algorithm
- update ArchitectureDomainManager and ArchitectureDomainMerger to be safe in
  concurrent access from the ArchitectureIndex
- adapt look-up of creation and conversion command classes to trace the class name
  to the source architecture model for the most appropriate bundle context
- update Architecture View to use the public merged model API
- adapt old merge tests to use new API
- add more test coverage of legacy merge
- test coverage of legacy merge mixed with explicit extensions
- test coverage for mixing context inheritance with context extension
- improve test coverage of the Merged Architecture façade API
- update documentation to describe new inheritance and extension concepts, and the merge algorithm
- add tracing options for analysis of run-time problems in architecture merge

Patch Set 6:

Patch set 6 addresses review comments and more:

* add details to the deprecations, including reference to API removal bug
* updates the bundle version to 3.1
* adds missing @since tags for new APIs
* updates @since tags to version 3.1 that were added before the 3.0 version was released but will not be merged until 3.1 (there is an @since that _was_ released in version 3.0, so that is unchanged)

I will discus with Remi this morning only to understand this part of the code ;D
Encapsulation is not useful, I need only to understand.
Line:30, plugins/infra/architecture/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.architecture/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/internal/architecture/merger/ArchitectureContextInheritanceRule.xtend -> Hi I do not understand this lines?
When I see the generated code I do not understand why the method hasSpecializations is affected by  the variable that comes from this injection. Could you send us reference about this please?

Hi could you add more comments about usage of @inject extension
I put -1 only to not forget this.

Line:30, plugins/infra/architecture/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.architecture/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/internal/architecture/merger/ArchitectureContextInheritanceRule.xtend -> Hi! Glad to help if I can.

In my opinion, extension methods are a critical benefit of Xtend for model transformations as compared to Java: they let us add API to the model for the purposes of the transformation, without modifying the model itself. No need to bloat it with APIs that are application-specific. The definitive reference for the extension mechanism is here:

https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/documentation/202_xtend_classes_members.html#extension-methods

(it doesn't hurt to have a background in Smalltalk, either, to enjoy extensions, so perhaps that's why I am so comfortable with them 😉)

On the matter of injection, this is the best way to make extensions available to a class because then Guice can take care of creating instances of an extension provider class and making sure they are provided where they are needed. Especially where there are bi-directional dependencies between Xtend classes, injection helps to decouple instantiating them from connecting them together. It's standard practice in Xtend especially with classes that provide extension methods to inject them into the classes that use those extensions.

Hope this helps!
