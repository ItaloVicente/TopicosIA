DESCRIPTION:

Bug 570486: [Architecture] Architecture model shall clearly define merge and inherit concepts

- implement new architecture domain merger with support for legacy algorithm
- update ArchitectureDomainManager and ArchitectureDomainMerger to be safe in
  concurrent access from the ArchitectureIndex
- adapt look-up of creation and conversion command classes to trace the class name
  to the source architecture model for the most appropriate bundle context
- update Architecture View to use the public merged model API
- adapt old merge tests to use new API
- add more test coverage of legacy merge
- test coverage of legacy merge mixed with explicit extensions
- test coverage for mixing context inheritance with context extension
- improve test coverage of the Merged Architecture façade API
- update documentation to describe new inheritance and extension concepts, and the merge algorithm
- add tracing options for analysis of run-time problems in architecture merge

Patch set 4 fixes both issues found in review, even the API backward compatibility problem that is verified in some degree at least by reverting an earlier change to a viewpoint PolicyChecker test that was using that deprecated API.

Hi,
could you add  @since for all deprecated, please? it will help us to remove deprecated  by managing majour version.

I remark that you use injection. I thinks that we need to discuss with Remi in order to be able to have procedure to be able to debug it when there is a bug.

I add only +1 because I will relauch the gerrit and I have alos to do a functional review.
Line:46, plugins/infra/architecture/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.architecture/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/architecture/merged/MergedArchitectureViewpoint.java -> could you add  @since it will help to remove it in the next majour release for example
