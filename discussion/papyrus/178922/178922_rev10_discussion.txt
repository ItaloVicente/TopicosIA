DESCRIPTION:

Bug 570486: [Architecture] Architecture model shall clearly define merge and inherit concepts

- implement new architecture domain merger with support for legacy algorithm
- update ArchitectureDomainManager and ArchitectureDomainMerger to be safe in
  concurrent access from the ArchitectureIndex
- adapt look-up of creation and conversion command classes to trace the class name
  to the source architecture model for the most appropriate bundle context
- update Architecture View to use the public merged model API
- adapt old merge tests to use new API
- add more test coverage of legacy merge
- test coverage of legacy merge mixed with explicit extensions
- test coverage for mixing context inheritance with context extension
- improve test coverage of the Merged Architecture façade API
- update documentation to describe new inheritance and extension concepts, and the merge algorithm
- add tracing options for analysis of run-time problems in architecture merge
