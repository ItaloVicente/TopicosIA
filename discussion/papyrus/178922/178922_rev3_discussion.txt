DESCRIPTION:

Bug 570486: [Architecture] Architecture model shall clearly define merge and inherit concepts

- implement new architecture domain merger with support for legacy algorithm
- update ArchitectureDomainManager and ArchitectureDomainMerger to be safe in
  concurrent access from the ArchitectureIndex
- adapt look-up of creation and conversion command classes to trace the class name
  to the source architecture model for the most appropriate bundle context
- update Architecture View to use the public merged model API
- adapt old merge tests to use new API
- add more test coverage of legacy merge
- test coverage of legacy merge mixed with explicit extensions
- test coverage for mixing context inheritance with context extension
- improve test coverage of the Merged Architecture façade API
- update documentation to describe new inheritance and extension concepts, and the merge algorithm
- add tracing options for analysis of run-time problems in architecture merge

A very nice addition to Papyrus, a lot of documentation & testing added in an area that needs stability and understanding.
Only 2 simple remarks about code. I did not run the tests myself (as they are running on the gerrit already).
Line:62, plugins/infra/architecture/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.architecture/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/architecture/merged/MergedADElement.java -> Could this deprecated method still be used? 
It may cause some NPE later on, as #getModel() may be used without checks.

Line:71, plugins/infra/architecture/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.architecture/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/architecture/merged/MergedADElement.java -> This element is not documented in javadoc

Line:62, plugins/infra/architecture/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.architecture/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/architecture/merged/MergedADElement.java -> Yes, in fact, it was used (indirectly) by the viewpoints test that had regressed, which I fixed in one of these revised patch sets. I'll see whether I can maintain compatibility with the previous behaviour. I'm not sure that I can without restoring a bunch more of the previous behaviour of this façade API, but perhaps that's just how it will have to be.

Line:71, plugins/infra/architecture/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.architecture/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/architecture/merged/MergedADElement.java -> Done

Thanks for fixing one of the issues. I would not fix the second one IMHO. I will add CEA to reviewers, they may have some other usages.
Line:62, plugins/infra/architecture/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.architecture/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/architecture/merged/MergedADElement.java -> Not really sure this one was dedicated to be instantiated outside of the tool and tests. This is probably not worth spending too much efforts on this one.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:62, plugins/infra/architecture/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.architecture/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/core/architecture/merged/MergedADElement.java -> Oh, ah. Well, sorry, I already had it fixed before I saw this reply! It really wasn't difficult once I actually gave it a moment's thought. I was even able to revert the earlier change to the viewpoint test that was using the deprecated API to verify that it works as before.
