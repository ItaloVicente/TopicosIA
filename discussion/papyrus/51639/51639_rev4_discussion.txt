- separated the core uml options from the dsml ones
- added a sort mechanism for them
- the wizard now properly recalls previous language selections
- sets the default language selection to UML if none were previously selected
- modified the way the DiagramKindPage composite's sizes are computed
- added a new Profile selection composite allowing the user to select registered composites
- modified the Messages of the NewModelFilePage
- the names of the languages are now sorted through a secondary strength collator
- the UML language is now the first on the UML core group

Thanks for adding access to registered profiles.  The languages look good, too.

The validation of the project name in the New Papyrus Project wizard still isn't right.  Initially, the page should present the normal prompt message "Choose your project path and the model name".  Instead, it now shows the error message "Project name must be specified" without the error icon.  What should happen is that, initially, the page cannot finish and presents its normal "Choose your project..." message.  Then, when the user enters the project name, the page can complete.  If the user subsequently clears the project name field, then the error message should be presented with the error icon.  What we have now is an in-between state:  the wizard is still showing the error message initially but without the icon, and if the user deletes the project name after typing one, the error message at this point still doesn't have the error icon.

The worse problem is that creating a UML profile fails with an exception if I choose to apply a profile to it.  I can't create a profile with the Ecore profile applied, which is a very common use case for statically generated profiles:

That is very strange as that has been the purpose of the change in the NewModelFilePage...
As for the new project, the first message is "Project name must be specified" then the next message is to choose the path and the model name.
I can listen if the user has clicked on all the buttons and fields to know that he has verified the predefined fiels but that does seem wastefull to me, or I do not understand at all what it is you want.

As the behavior is not allow the user to press next without a valid project name that seems right does'nt it ?

Again I found that, as the user cant click Next if the fields are not set the extra boolean verifying that the user has/hasnt already been on this page is a bit strange just to put an Error message. (FYI the message is a Message not an ErrorMessage)

I will look into it as soon as I can.

Okay, I've had a look at the New Java Project wizard for an example.  It works the same way.  I withdraw my comment, with apologies.  Best to be consistent with JDT.

All that remains is the applying-a-profile-to-a-profile bug.
