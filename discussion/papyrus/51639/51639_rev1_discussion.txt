DESCRIPTION:

Bug 471735: New Model Wizard usability regressions
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=471735

- added new icons for the new Model/Project wizard
- separated the core uml options from the dsml ones
- added a sort mechanism for them
- the wizard now properly recalls previous language selections
- sets the default language selection to UML if none were previously selected

Much improved!  Thanks.  Still some issues, though:

* I think UML should be the first item in the list (not Profile) because that's the primary language and probably used a lot more than Profile.  The DSMLs can be alpha-sorted
* whitespace before the colons in the widget labels
* the New Project wizard shows an error when stepping to the second page.  It should not initially show an error that no project name is specified.  It should just not be ready to finish and the page should show the "Choose your project path and the model name" message.  The error can be shown if the user types a name and then deletes it
* I still don't see an option to apply a profile deployed in a plug-in
* The second model I create in a project has the name 'model2.di' suggested.  Fine.  But then the third is suggested as 'model22.di', not 'model3.di' as I would expect

I think another Gerrit change addresses the problem of not being able to select no template once some choice has been made, right?
Line:46, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.wizards/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/wizards/messages/messages.properties -> Why the space before the colon?  That is not correct English grammar.  Please remove this and other similar occurrences.

That was my view also but I understood you wanted everything alpha-sorted so i sorted everything ;p I will correct this.

 > * whitespace before the colons in the widget labels
I didnt know that (although it might be the same in French now that I think about it...) it is corrected for the next patch.

I will see how to do this

No you are right, I did not ask yet to Camille/Remi about that I will do it as soon as I fix the previous issues.

Hum... once again I find myself fishing for a use case as it does increment to model3.di on my end.

Yes gerrit https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/51171/ but it has been mentioned that it was not the best solution.
Line:46, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.wizards/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/wizards/messages/messages.properties -> Done

Line:252, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.wizards/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/wizards/pages/SelectDiagramCategoryPage.java -> no no sounds fun :) I never used a collator before so i will try to do this ;)

Line:347, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.wizards/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/wizards/pages/SelectDiagramCategoryPage.java -> yes, forgot to delete it, my bad.

Line:252, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.wizards/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/wizards/pages/SelectDiagramCategoryPage.java -> should I set the strength to Secondary ? or is it a bit too much ?

Oops, sorry, probably I expressed myself too succinctly.  :-/

You can reproduce it thus:

Create a new Papyrus project and take the defaults.  It creates model1.di.
Now create a new Papyrus model with "Profile" language and take the defaults.  That creates model2.profile.di.
Then create a new Papyrus model with "UML" language and take the defaults.  You get model22.di.

On further reflection, considering how obscure this scenario is, and the fact that anybody who actually uses the name "model2" for a model that presumably they care about should learn to choose better names, I withdraw my previous comment.  Don't worry about the default model file naming.  :-)

Line:252, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.wizards/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/wizards/pages/SelectDiagramCategoryPage.java -> I agree that the secondary strength produces the most intuitive results for sorting selectable items in an UI.  The advantage of the collator over a String::compareTo sort is illustrated easily:

Using String::compareTo:
[Des, Destination, Dés, des, destination, dés]

Using a secondary-strength collator:
[des, Des, dés, Dés, destination, Destination]
