This patch fixes the Di model participant for Control Mode feature and it adds a test a non-regression.
Line:78, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.controlmode/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/controlmode/commands/CleanSashCommand.java -> I manage two cases during clean command.

Line:120, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.controlmode/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/controlmode/commands/InitializeSashCommand.java -> I look for the good location for Sash manager. To determine this location, the research is based on the location of the root Sash.

Line:142, tests/junit/plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.controlmode.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/controlmode/tests/control/ControlLegacyModelTest.java -> The method tests the contents of the Di model file.

Line:119, tests/junit/plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.controlmode.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/controlmode/tests/control/ControlModelTest.java -> The method tests the contents of Di model file for Standard case.

I've added a few comments, then realized that maybe the solution is much easier than that.
Line:91, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.controlmode/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/controlmode/commands/InitializeSashCommand.java -> Use LogHelper

Line:94, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.controlmode/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/controlmode/commands/InitializeSashCommand.java -> Use LogHelper

Line:147, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.controlmode/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/controlmode/commands/InitializeSashCommand.java -> PageList is deprecated in Luna. Let's not populate something which is not used anymore, even in Legacy mode

The PageList is not used anymore. Not populating it (at all) should be sufficient. So maybe removing the SashControlParticipant is sufficient to support all cases.

I don't think the Control Mode command populates the TabFolder (Which is the only relevant thing in the SashModel now)

I renamed the SashControlParticipant to DiControlParticipant because this is the Di file which needs to be controlled. It is to this participant to manage Sash model contents during control/uncontrol. And if we remove Sash contents management, the Legacy behaviour will be lost. I tested it.

I just removed the part which filled the pageList and I updated the code with new PageManager API.
Line:147, plugins/infra/services/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.controlmode/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/services/controlmode/commands/InitializeSashCommand.java -> I doesn't use the page list in correction despite  what the comment says. I just add the opened page to SashWindowsManager.

Then it may be changed to only create a default (empty) SashWindowsMngr. All it needs is a SashModel/Windows/TabFolder (With no specific content). Then you don't have to update the PageList/TabFolder contents

Anyway, the PageList shouldn't be created/populated
