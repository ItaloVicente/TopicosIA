DESCRIPTION:

Bug 463156: [Assistants] Integrate with viewpoints for filtering
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=463156

Add a Modeling Assistant filtering rule to the Viewpoint Configurations model.
This allows a viewpoint author to constrain the modeling assistants (by element
type ID pattern) applicable to diagrams in the same fashion as palette tools.

Some additional changes are made to clean up re-generation of the code from the
model:

* enable formatting and clean-up in the genmodel
* update the copyright for generation of new files
* disable generation of a resource implementation, as we have a custom
  resource factory for this model
* turn off generation of creation icons, since using the composed icons
  is sufficient for our purposes and for some reason we use PNGs anyways
* git-ignore the GIF images that EMF will always generate because for some
  reason we use PNGs instead

The viewpoints PolicyChecker adds API to test filtering of modeling assistants.

The model-based diagram assistants provider is updated to filter its results
through the active PolicyChecker.

Generate the tests bundle for the Viewpoints Configuration model, implement test
TODOs, and create a JUnit launch configuration.  Integrate the tests into the
master Papyrus test suite.

The commit comment describes the changes.

What is not included here is any updates to viewpoints for SysML, UML-RT, etc. to filter out superfluous/unwanted modelling assistant contributions from their diagrams.  I leave that to the experts in those domains.  However, I did some ad hoc testing of the viewpoint filtering mechanism by hacking the default Papyrus viewpoint.

Thanks, Camille.  I'd like to know if Benoit (to whom I defer as the Viewpoints expert) has any concerns about the changes in the Viewpoints model before I submit this.

Hi Christian,

I made some comments.
Also :

    - Do we have a policy on Java level for new project ? (I would expect at least 1.7) 
  - when I create a new rule, I have NewChild > Assistant : {0} => {1}
=>Is there a specific meaning behind this Label ? A user will expect to fill 2 values and there is only one field (Element Type ID)

   - Do you have a configuration example to test on a real use case ?

Line:56, plugins/infra/viewpoints/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.configuration/model/configuration.ecore -> Wrong documentation (Probably coming from copy/paste)

Line:69, plugins/infra/viewpoints/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.configuration/model/configuration.ecore -> Why removing the platform ?

Line:9, tests/junit/plugins/infra/viewpoints/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.configuration.tests/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Maybe 1.7 (1.7 is already required for Luna)

Line:12, tests/junit/plugins/infra/viewpoints/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.configuration.tests/pom.xml -> Can be removed, it will use the values provided by the parent

Line:41, tests/junit/plugins/infra/viewpoints/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.configuration.tests/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/viewpoints/configuration/tests/AssistantRuleTest.java -> Tag @genereated should be only present in src-gen
(otherwise we can remove the tags)

Thanks, Benoit.  I appreciate your help.

I copied an existing test project as a starting point, and it was 1.6.  But you're right, 1.7 is the new baseline.

I have, however, occasionally been motivated to change existing plug-ins from 1.6 to 1.7 for some reason, but resisted.  I'm not sure why.  :-/

Yeah, I forgot that EMF.Edit separately uses the type string in the creation menus.  I've fixed that.  This is meant only to be the label to show for a rule in the editor tree (not in the menu).  It's the same formula as for palette rules, for example, but I wanted to externalize the string (which the PaletteRuleItemProvider does not).

 
 > - Do you have a configuration example to test on a real use case ?

I tested with local edits to the oep.viewpoints.policy/builtin/default.configuration, using wildcard and exact IDs and a combination of deny and allow rules.  I need to leave the specification of rules in the UML-RT, SysML, etc. viewpoints to the respective domain experts, though.

Does that answer your question?
Line:56, plugins/infra/viewpoints/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.configuration/model/configuration.ecore -> Done

Line:69, plugins/infra/viewpoints/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.configuration/model/configuration.ecore -> That's just how EMF's Mars M6 Ecore editor saved it.  Which editor was used to edit this previously, that wrote out a platform:/ URI?  I can fix it in text, but it's worrisome that we're seeing different behaviour (from different tools?)

I've seen this in the GMFGen models, too, in spades ...

Line:69, plugins/infra/viewpoints/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.configuration/model/configuration.ecore -> This is typically fixed by hand in the text, since the Ecore Editor (And GMFGen editor) don't do it by default (And this causes lots of issues)

For GMFGen, we've been considering implementing our own editor for some time but this has never been done. This would be useful for Ecore, too (Unless we switch to 100% UML, but I suspect that the generated Ecore might have such URIs too)

Line:69, plugins/infra/viewpoints/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.configuration/model/configuration.ecore -> Oh, my, that sounds like a lot of work!  I'll have to remember to do that.  I actually do my modelling with UML, and I haven't had problems with it, but maybe I just haven't noticed?

But, patch set 2 does restore the platform scheme URI.  :-)
