DESCRIPTION:

Bug 463156: [Assistants] Integrate with viewpoints for filtering
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=463156

Add a Modeling Assistant filtering rule to the Viewpoint Configurations model.
This allows a viewpoint author to constrain the modeling assistants (by element
type ID pattern) applicable to diagrams in the same fashion as palette tools.

Some additional changes are made to clean up re-generation of the code from the
model:

* enable formatting and clean-up in the genmodel
* update the copyright for generation of new files
* disable generation of a resource implementation, as we have a custom
  resource factory for this model
* turn off generation of creation icons, since using the composed icons
  is sufficient for our purposes and for some reason we use PNGs anyways
* git-ignore the GIF images that EMF will always generate because for some
  reason we use PNGs instead

The viewpoints PolicyChecker adds API to test filtering of modeling assistants.

The model-based diagram assistants provider is updated to filter its results
through the active PolicyChecker.

Generate the tests bundle for the Viewpoints Configuration model, implement test
TODOs, and create a JUnit launch configuration.  Integrate the tests into the
master Papyrus test suite.
