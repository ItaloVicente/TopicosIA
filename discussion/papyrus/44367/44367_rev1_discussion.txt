DESCRIPTION:

Bug 433206: Papyrus shall enable local synchronization between graphical element and element in the model
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=433206

[1] Refactor the 'uml.diagram.synchronizeview' plug-in:

* remove the UML dependency (supplied by a UML-specific default children strategy)
* move into infra.gmfdiag component
* rename for GMF-standard 'canonical' terminology
* API types, extension points, etc. renamed for 'canonical' terminology
* fix parsing of priorities and other problems in the extension-point loading
* support listening to multiple dependent model elements for canonical refresh
* add a notion of default semantic children strategies for edit-parts that don't have specific requirements but can rely on a generic implementation

[2] Implement a canonical request wrapper to pass through the drop request to default
drop edit policy provided by the diagram, by-passing the pluggable strategies
to which the CustomizableDopEditPolicy delegates.

[3] Implement a toggle action in the various diagram filter menus to toggle canonical
synchronization.

[4] Enable the canonical edit policy provider.  This requires additional changes:

* only activate the canonical edit policy when the style is applied and is enabled
  because otherwise GMF assumes that canonical mode is on and treats connections
  as canonical (GMF run-time only checks that the edit policy is installed and
  is active)
* listen for changes to the canonical style to disable/enable the canonical edit
  policy on the fly

[5] Fix undo/redo of canonical view creation and of canonical enablement.

[6] Properties view support for model/view synchronization (canonical edit policy).

[7] Adapt SysML test utility to account for possible inclusion of
ToggleCanonicalModeCommand by GMF in drop commands.

[8] Implement deferred loading of synch child strategies and XML enablement expressions.

[9] Fix problems in handling of connections incoming and outgoing canonical top shapes.

[10] Support for a CSS 'canonical' style attribute.

[11] Initial simple canonical synchronization scenarios for JUnit test cases.

[12] Integrate canonical edit policy tests into the build.

[13] Test cases for toggling canonical on/off, with undo/redo.
Test cases for adding elements to the semantic model, with undo/redo.
Test cases for deleting elements from the semantic model (including by
simple remove, which unlike destroy does not also deletes dependent
views anyways), with undo/redo.

[14] Add regression tests for creation/deletion of elements and views together per the
usual diagram editing scenarios, in the context of canonical diagrams.

[15] Fix problems in canonical creation (with undo and redo) of connection views for
non-owned relationship elements.

[16] Add tests for CSS control of canonical synchronization.
Fix inability to override CSS canonical style to turn synchronization off on selected views.

Bug 461629: [CSS] Diagram refresh undo/redo problems
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=461629

Implement new DiagramHelper refresh APIs to fix a few problems:

- encapsulate synchronous (forced) and asynchronous refresh in new API methods.
  Deprecate the old methods that required clients to follow several steps. Update
  various client call sites to use the new API instead of the deprecated API

- add corresponding APIs for refresh of individual DiagramEditParts, with similar
  heuristic for dropping redundant refresh requests

- re-implement asynchronous refresh to use a new TransactionalEditingDomain executor
  that runs tasks as pre-commit trigger commands, to capture any undo/redo information
  for model changes

- implement a new transaction option in the Papyrus editing domain that prevents
  runExclusive calls creating read-only transactions nested within a write transaction,
  so that canonical changes ensuing from edit-part refresh during refresh tasks can
  be properly recorded (without unprotected writes nested in the read-only context)

Bug 433206: Papyrus shall enable local synchronization between graphical element and element in the model
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=433206

[17] Enable test cases unblocked by the fix for undo/redo problems in diagram refresh
(being bug 461629).

[18] Do not record the edit-part but the view in the SetCanonicalCommand to support undo/redo
even if the diagram has been closed and re-opened in the mean-time.  To refresh the
CanonicalEditPolicy's activation state after execute/undo/redo, the command now searches
on the fly for all edit-parts (in all open diagram editors) that present the view in
question.

[19] Implement a new 'semi-active' state in the PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy that is its
minimally active state.  This allows the edit policy to react to semantic model changes
to delete views for deleted model elements, where such views are ones that it had
originally created by canonical refresh.  This relies on new tracking of canonically-
created views, which in turn relies on a new utility for digging through complex command
tree structures to get the views that were created by them.

Includes automated tests for non-transactional refresh creating canonical views, with
undo and redo in the semantic model undoing and redoing creationg of the elements that
had been canonically created, after the canonical edit policy was (non-transactionally)
disabled.

[20] Don't forget about views that were created canonically if the diagram happens to be
closed and then re-opened.

[21] Rework the CanonicalStateListener to support injection of refresh 'pokes' to trigger
updates in other dependents, such as the Properties view, when change in canonical
activation is detected for any reason.

[22] New JUnit tests for:
- undo of semantic model change that created a canonical view after canonical edit policy
  disabled by CSS and close/reopen of the diagram
- canonical edit policy's book-keeping does not leak diagram views nor model elements

[23] CanonicalStateListener should be auto-retained because it automatically installs itself,
and it won't be uninstalled except when successfully released.

[24] Fix layout (margins etc.) of Synchronization properties group.

[25] Fix concurrent modification in iteration over diagram edit part tree.
Rationalize state-transition logic in canonical edit policy.

[26] Fix some problems in canonical composite structures (incomplete):
- manage connections canonically on border items as well as top shapes
- do not include connectors as semantic children of structured classifiers but only
  as connections/edges of their connected elements
- do not create parts of Association type when dropping an Association onto a
  structured classifier
- include notation context in children-strategy query to account for structures such as
  part-with-port in connectors to disambiguate repeated semantic elements
- add canonical composite structure tests (one still failing)

[27] Refactor the canonical children strategies extension point ID to make it more meaningful
and less redundant.

Shave some execution time off the execution of the canonical edit policy tests in the
automated build environment where we don't need to see what is happening in the diagrams.
This involves a refactoring of earlier infrastructure that detects the build server or
local Maven/Tycho build environment.

[28] Fix failure to create canonical connection views because source/target nodes that were
created canonically don't yet have their edit-parts.  The canonical creation of
connections is now deferred using the transaction pre-commit executor, exposed as a new
DiagramHelper::submit(...) API.

Several JUnit tests need updating, both to correct erroneous assumptions on latent bugs
now fixed, and also to add UI event-processing in undo/redo scenarios to account for
deferred connection creation.

Use a DeferredLayoutCommand to improve the layout of the contents added to shape
compartments by canonical 'drop', which otherwise would all be stacked on top of
one another.

Add a new pluggable strategy for determination of the edit-part that should handle
creation of views, for cases such as flows in activities where connections must be
dropped into contents compartments, not onto either the source or target node shape.

The following is a general overview of the changeset, which is a squash of a sequence
of 29 distinct, self-contained commits.

This feature is based on the prototype of a canonical edit policy in the
org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.synchronizeview plug-in that was committed in the Luna release
but not put to use.  This plug-in is refactored to extract the UML dependency:  the core
canonical edit policy and extensibility APIs are in the oep.infra.gmfdiag.canonical
plug-in.  UML-specific extensions are in the oep.uml.diagram.common plug-in and also in
the individual diagrams.

The original prototype created views by invoking the commands retrieved by DropRequests
from the canonical edit-part.  This is modified by wrapping the DropRequest in a new kind
of request (CanonicalDropObjectsRequest) that passes through the Papyrus customizable
drop edit policy to by-pass the pluggable strategies, going straight to the drop behaviour
generated by GMF for each specific diagram.  This resolves the problem of not being able
to rely on the View Service for creation of views while avoiding interference from the
pluggable drop strategies.

The PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy is installed by its edit-policy provider on all top shapes
and compartments.  It is only fully activated when the CanonicalStyle is applied to the
notation view with canonical=true.  Otherwise, the edit policy is in a semi-active state
in which it will destroy obsolete views (for elements that are no longer semantic children
of the host element) but will not create new views.  This addresses specific undo/redo
scenarios involving non-transactional changes to canonical activation.

The UI provides several means to activate the PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy:  a new context
menu action in the Filters menu; a new property in the Appearance tab of the property
sheet; and support for a 'canonical' CSS style attribute.  These all infer an implicit
CanonicalStyle with canonical=false for notation views that do not have the style applied.
In the case of CSS, this is implemented by support for inferred Styles of any kind as was
done for NamedStyles.  So far, this is enabled only for the CanonicalStyle.

The PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy manages canonical presentation of child nodes and also
connections attached to top shapes.  The pluggable children strategies are expected to
provide elements representing connections when requested.  The default UML strategy
accommodates this by providing owned directed relationships of all kinds, associations,
connectors, state transitions, activity flows, messages, etc.  In reacting to semantic
children that need views created, the edit policy does this in two stages:  first creating
views for child nodes and second (deferred by asynchronous execution) creating connection
views.  This deferral is necessary to allow for edit-part refresh to create edit-parts
for newly created node views before we attempt to create connections between then (which
requires that the source and target views have edit parts managing them).

This changeset also addresses bug 461629 concerning problems in canonical refresh of
the diagram when undoing/redoing semantic-model changes intermixed with non-transactional
refreshes that change the activation of canonical edit policy.  Central in this is new
API in the DiagramHelper for asynchronous execution of refresh and other operations.
This uses a new Executor utility for TransactionalEditingDomains that runs asynchronous
operations as pre-commit ("trigger") commands of the currently active write transaction,
or just on the display's event queue if there is no write transaction.  This allows view
deletion/creation by canonical refresh to be recorded in the current transaction for
undo/redo whenever canonical activation is changed by an edit command (such as explicit
installation of a CanonicalStyle or application of CSS stylesheets or style classes).

Finally, there is a suite of JUnit tests covering various scenarios in canonical
synchronization, including some edge cases of undo/redo interaction with non-transactional
CSS changes.  These scenarios are tested in various UML diagrams and, as such, are
dependent on the specific UML extensions (pluggable strategies) of the framework.
