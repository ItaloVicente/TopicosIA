DESCRIPTION:

Bug 477384: [Canonical] Should not use drop requests to create views
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=477384

Changes to core APIs to remove PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy's dependence
on the generated diagram drag-and-drop behavior:

* extract the CommonDiagramDragDropEditPolicy's abstract API for
  information about diagram-specific visual IDs into a new service

* update the canonical edit-policy and diagram-to-diagram
  synchronization infrastructure to use the new VisualTypeService to
  obtain information about the diagram's specific visual IDs to then
  let the view service create views without resorting to drop commands

* update extensions of various canonical strategies in the UML diagrams
  to adapt to the new drop-free synchronization mechanism

Update the Papyrus Diagram GMFGen extensions and code generation
templates to add generation of the IVisualTypeProvider that plugs into
the new VisualTypeService to support canonical synchronization and
drag-and-drop.

Includes regeneration of the GMFGen extension model using EMF's most
recent templates, which result in minor changes to most model source
files.

Regenerate all UML diagrams to create and register the visual type
provider extensions.  Also update the BREE for diagrams to 1.8 because
at least one of them requires Java 8 to compile properly.

* Note that the interaction overview diagram uses a code generator that
  is not published on Eclipse.org, so I had to emulate the code
  generation step for this one

* Note also that the SysML 1.1 diagrams likewise cannot be re-generated
  but, moreover, they do not implement the common pattern for Visual ID
  Registry, so they are not updated and will, therefore, probably not
  support canonical synchronization

Deprecate the ICreationTargetStrategy extension API which was only
needed to redirect drag-and-drop requests, but these are no longer
employed in the canonical synchronization.

A word about why this change set adds a new service for introspection of the diagram's specific Visual ID meta-information:  although the UMLVisualIDRegistry of each diagram exposes a TYPED_INSTANCE implementing the GMF tooling DiagramStructure protocol, this is not sufficient because:

* it doesn't provide visual IDs for semantic connections
* it doesn't provide element types for visual IDs
* it isn't discoverable:  the TYPED_INSTANCE has to be injected into objects that need it, which implies additional API changes in the edit policies that need it

Patch set 2 adds the papyrus.def bundle to the developer feature (it was never packaged in any feature, before!).  That should fix the (first) test build failure.

Okay, so it turns out that this papyrus.def bundle has never been included in the build, not even in the top POM.  And if it had been, JDT/Tycho wouldn't have been able to build it properly.

The prototype of UML-RT capsule state machine synchronization in the old UML-RT extra component needed updates for the changes in this task.

Gagh! The releng/dev/pom.xml was still hard-coded to 1.7 compatibility for compilation.  I've fixed it, now, to use the same properties as the other POMs.
