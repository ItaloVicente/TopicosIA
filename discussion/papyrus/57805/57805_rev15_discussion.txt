DESCRIPTION:

Bug 477384: [Canonical] Should not use drop requests to create views
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=477384

Changes to core APIs to remove PapyrusCanonicalEditPolicy's dependence
on the generated diagram drag-and-drop behavior:

* extract the CommonDiagramDragDropEditPolicy's abstract API for
  information about diagram-specific view types into a new service

* update the canonical edit-policy and diagram-to-diagram
  synchronization infrastructure to use the new VisualTypeService to
  obtain information about the diagram's specific view types to then
  let the view service create views without resorting to drop commands

* update extensions of various canonical strategies in the UML diagrams
  to adapt to the new drop-free synchronization mechanism

Update the Papyrus Diagram GMFGen extensions and code generation
templates to add generation of the IVisualTypeProvider that plugs into
the new VisualTypeService to support canonical synchronization and
drag-and-drop.

Includes regeneration of the GMFGen extension model using EMF's most
recent templates, which result in minor changes to most model source
files.

Regenerate all UML diagrams to create and register the visual type
provider extensions.  Also update the BREE for diagrams to 1.8 because
at least one of them requires Java 8 to compile properly.

* Note that the interaction overview diagram uses a code generator that
  is not published on Eclipse.org, so I had to emulate the code
  generation step for this one

* Note also that the SysML 1.1 diagrams likewise cannot be re-generated
  but, moreover, they do not implement the common pattern for Visual ID
  Registry, so they are also updated "by hand" for parity with the
  Mars implementation of drag-and-drop (which had gaps)

Deprecate the ICreationTargetStrategy extension API which was only
needed to redirect drag-and-drop requests, but these are no longer
employed in the canonical synchronization.

Also some fixes for region layout problems in the State Machine Diagram:

* update custom creation edit policies to re-use the commands used by
  drag-and-drop and untargeted creation that perform initial placement
  of new regions
* fix the GMFGen to register the custom creation edit policy for the
  state machine compartment

This new architecture looks good. I only have one comment on the SysML Element Types constants, but I'm not sure how this could behave/fail exactly. I just know Remi has had some issues with them
Line:63, plugins/sysml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.sysml.diagram.common/src-common-gmf/org/eclipse/papyrus/gmf/diagram/common/provider/SysMLVisualTypeProvider.java -> I think we can have issues with these constants, since ElementTypes can now be dynamically unloaded, and the constants become stale. Remi can tell more about this issue

Line:63, plugins/sysml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.sysml.diagram.common/src-common-gmf/org/eclipse/papyrus/gmf/diagram/common/provider/SysMLVisualTypeProvider.java -> Indeed, this was particularly awkward.  This basically emulates by reflection what is normally generated, as in the UML diagrams.  Those also rely on the static element type constants, which implicitly rely on the element-types configuration models never being unloaded.

AFAIK, Papyrus never actually does unload the plug-in registered element-types models such as the UML and Notation element-types.  I expect the same is true for the SysML element types.  There's no mechanism by which they would be unloaded.  The menu actions for installing and uninstalling element-types only apply to the *.elementypesconfigurations resources in the user's workspace.
