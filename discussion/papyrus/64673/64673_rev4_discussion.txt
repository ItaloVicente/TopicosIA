DESCRIPTION:

Bug 486122 - [Codegen C++] First letter of each line of method body is
removed if the default indentation is less than 4 spaces

- The decreaseIndent method now has an 'indentation' parameter
- We compare against this much indentation
- The old method is kept for compatibility, and it only calls the new
method with 'indentation=4'
- Fix a bug where if we find a non-space char, we add it to the new
block right away and we decrease consume to 0. Otherwise the first
letter of the line is skipped if the indentation is less than the
'indentation' parameter (hard-coded as 4 before).
