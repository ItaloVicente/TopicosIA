The first page still shows "Select language of the diagram" as its title.  That should probably rather be "Select language of the model" or some such as now this question is a prelude to specifying where the model is to be created, not which diagram(s) to create.

Also, when changing the selection to/from "Profile" language, the informational message about changing the file name is presented as before.  This doesn't make sense now, as we have not yet been asked to input any file name.  Moreover, that was the point of this bug:  that this message was only necessary because the wizard pages are not in a more intuitive order.
Line:141, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.wizards/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/wizards/CreateModelWizard.java -> Let's just remove this commented-out statement.
