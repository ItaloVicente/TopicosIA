DESCRIPTION:

Bug 435501 - [Usability] The create new model wizard asks questions in
the wrong order 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=435501

- changed the order of the wizard pages
- made the new model name retain '.profile' if based on existing
semantic model
- Changed the SelectDiagramCatagoryPage message to show 'model' rather
than 'diagram' (since it is the model type that is selected)
- removed the warning message shown when the model type didn't match the
extension (since the extension is set automatically)

The UI work-flow is better, and we're almost there.  There's just something hard-coded that doesn't have to be.

Also, I know that the current Luna state of the wizard doesn't do this, but since we're improving the work-flow in this wizard, it's worth considering:  whereas previously the new-file-name page alerted the user when the suggested name was changed to adopt the file extension recommended for the selected language, and now we don't need to do that (good), it would be nice to alert the user in this page when the user enters a file name that looks like it is associated with a different language than what was selected in the first page.  For example, if I select the "UML" language, the next wizard page suggests "model.di" for the file name.  If I edit that to make "model.profile.di", it now looks like I should be creating a model on the "Profile" language, but I'm not; it's still "UML" language.  It would be nice to alert the user about this case.  As remarked in an in-line comment, we can use the DiagramCategoryRegistry to discover the language-specific file extensions to look for when validating the new file name.

As this isn't strictly in the scope of this particular bug/change-request, I'm happy to carve it out into a separate usability enhancement.  The -1 on the review is only for the hard-coded ".profile" in the processing of the file name in the getUniqueFileName(...) method.
Line:140, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.wizards/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/wizards/pages/NewModelFilePage.java -> I can see why this is necessary, with the change a few lines above from 'indexOf(".")' to 'lastIndexOf(".")'.  However, there are two things I don't like about it:

  * what about, say, "model.profile.profile.di" ? (granted, unlikely,
    but handled by the previous version of this code)
  * more seriously, this hard-codes an extension that is defined in
    a <diagramCategory> contributed by some plug-in on the
    org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.papyrusDiagram extension point.
    Other plug-ins can define additional extensions that aren't
    enumerated, here. Rather than hard-coding this, we should look
    up the extensions that need to be trimmed off in the
    DiagramCategoryRegistry

Line:147, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.wizards/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/wizards/pages/NewModelFilePage.java -> I know that you didn't change this, but this statement just repeats the previous and can be deleted.

I've actually thought of something similar but I guess that has to be done in a similar way looking at the
org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.core.papyrusDiagram extension point contributions.

I'd prefer to have this as a separate enhancement.

I wasn't aware that DiagramCategoryRegistry
Line:140, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.wizards/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/wizards/pages/NewModelFilePage.java -> I'm just think of what the desired behavior would be. 

Regarding the first item, what would "model.profile.dummy.profile.di" be changed to? I guess the removed should go from the end of the string and remove all know extension until it finds a unknown and then stop. E.g. in the above example the first profile could refer to another profile than a UML profile and thus shouldn't be removed (assuming that 'dummy' isn't a known extension).

Line:147, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.wizards/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/wizards/pages/NewModelFilePage.java -> I saw it but forgot to remove it. Will do.
