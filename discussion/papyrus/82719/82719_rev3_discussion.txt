DESCRIPTION:

Bug 504059 - [Tooling] The orientation of the behavior adornment is not updated when moving port to another border

- Do not check for an exact positioning of the port center on the borders of the owning composite, but tolerate
	a deviation by 1. This assures that the port side is correctly recognized at some zoom levels.

Patch Set 3:

I've analyzed the problem a bit deeper in the meantime. While the check resolves the problem, the port is actually not at the location where we want it to be (if deplaced at zoom != 100%). The problem is the loss of precision during the translation to absolute coordinates (implying scaling) and back to relative ones when based on the connectionAnchor. This is required since the latter does the calculation on absolute coordinates. I tried to base the calculation on PrecisePoints/PreciseRectangles, but the GMF class wants the standard integer points as parameters.
