DESCRIPTION:

458197: [Profile Applications] Customized DSML palettes not enabled in UI when loading Profile Applications
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=458197

Implement a new Profile Application Listener exactly analogous to the StereotypeElementListener (and, in fact, installed by the same service) that notifies interested parties when profiles are applied to and unapplied from packages in the UML model.  As for stereotype applications in which there is no real feature on which to make the notifications, the custom notifications injected by the ProfileApplicationListener are dispatched via the affected Package and reference an applied or unapplied Profile.

Includes a new test suite for the ProfileApplicationListener (same test scenarios as the previous patch) in the existing test plug-in for oep.uml.tools, alongside the StereotypeElementListener tests.

I don't see how this is possible.  In the scenario under discussion, the Package::profileApplications feature does not change in any way, so notifying on it would be incorrect.  The feature that changes is only the list computed by the Package::getAppliedProfiles(...) operation, and EMF's notifications make no provision for notifications on operations.

I think it is.  ;-)

Well, as it happens, the PapyrusPaletteService is rather indiscriminate.  As implemented in Luna, the PaletteProfileApplicationListener was triggered by any SET on any feature of a ProfileApplication (not just the appliedProfile, and omitting UNSET!).  And on this trigger, it would refresh the PapyrusPaletteService, which basically just broadcasts to the world that "something has changed so all diagrams have to rebuild their palettes".

Okay, so I've taken a different tack with this second patch set.  This implements a new ProfileApplicationListener exactly analogous to the StereotypeElementListener (and, in fact, installed by the same service) that notifies interested parties when profiles are applied to and unapplied from packages in the UML model.  As for stereotype applications in which there is no real feature on which to make the notifications, the custom notifications injected by the ProfileApplicationListener are dispatched via the affected Package and reference an applied or unapplied Profile without reference to any feature (the only reasonable candidates would be the getAppliedProfiles(...) or getAllAppliedProfiles(...) operation, which do not support change notification).

Includes a new test suite for the ProfileApplicationListener (same test scenarios as the previous patch) in the existing test plug-in for oep.uml.tools, alongside the StereotypeElementListener tests.  So, much less overhead there.

This new patch does not introduce a new service, but does require some other incidental tweaks:

* the PaletteProfileApplicationListener (an IPapyrusListener) still
  lives to kick the palette service, but it now listeners for the new
  profile-application notifications.  This does mean that the
  PapyrusPaletteService, itself, is unchanged (a good thing)

* a new ephemeral cache of decorator-model package bindings
  is added so that we can remember what the actual user package
  is that has an externalized profile application after a decorator
  model is unloaded, for as long as we may need to know

The second point above is important because the notifications that the ProfileApplicationListener sends need to be dispatched from the package in the user model, not its Doppelgänger in the decorator model, both in the "applied" and "unapplied" cases.  A common occurrence of profiles being unapplied now is the unloading of a decorator model, after which we have lost the traceability to the user model.

It is important to send these notifications from the packages in the user model because the ModelListenerManager that distributes notifications to IPapyrusListeners only listens to the "main" model resource.  It isn't attached to decorator models, and that isn't something that I want to change.

So, overall, a bit less complexity here traded for a bit more complexity there.  ;-)
