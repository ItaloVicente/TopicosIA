DESCRIPTION:

458197: [Profile Applications] Customized DSML palettes not enabled in UI when loading Profile Applications
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=458197

Implement a new Profile Application Service that notifies interested parties when profiles are applied to and unapplied from packages in the UML model.  Use this new service instead of an IPapyrusListener to trigger Palette Service updates.  The DecoratorModel injects appropriate profile-applied events into the service when loading externalized profile applications.

Includes a new test fragment oep.uml.profile.tests to deliver tests for the new Profile Application Service.

Patch Set 1:

This patch adds a new Profile Application Service that detects when profiles are applied to and unapplied from packages and notifies interested listeners of those changes.  So, the Palette Service now adds itself as a listener on the Profile Application Service to refresh itself when profile applications come and go.  This replaces the previous IPapyrusListener-based refresh trigger.

The Profile Application Service also allows clients to inject application/unapplication events that it otherwise could not detect on its own.  The DecoratorModel that handles loading of profile-application models makes use of this capability to let clients of the Profile Application Service know when externalized profiles have been loaded (unloads take care of themselves via the usual notification mechanism).

The Gerrit patch also contains a bunch of unit tests covering profile-application change scenarios of various complexity to verify the unfortunately complex analysis of notifications from the editing domain, owing to the fact that changes in either or both of the profile-applications list of a package and applied-profile reference of an application constitute application/unapplication of a profile on a package.  These tests are in a new test fragment, as there previously were no tests for the oep.uml.profile plug-in that defines the new service.

Is it not possible to rely on the EMF Notifications for the Package#profileApplication feature? That wasn't possible for Stereotypes because UML Element don't (directly) know their stereotypes, but it might be possible to do it for Profile Applications? Relying on the EMF Notifications when they exist would be safer (If possible, of course)

Unless we actually want to listen on getAllProfileApplications() (Including the inherited ones), in which case the EMF StructuralFeature doesn't exist and there's nothing to listen to

No, that's why the IPapyrusListener implementation from Luna doesn't work with externalized profiles:  because there simply are no EMF-style Notifications from the model to indicate that profile applications have changed.  They are inferred from a convention established in the "decorator model".  It's actually very much like the stereotype case:  here, packages don't actually "know" their profile applications.  :-)

What do you mean by "safer"?    Do you mean piggy-backing on the EMF Notification mechanism with a custom notification in the way that the StereotypeElementListener does it?  Personally, I prefer not to bend the semantics of EMF Notifications as far as that, but if you would prefer it, I can give it a try.  Then the IPapyrusListener might still work and there needn't be any changes in the PaletteService at all ...

Right.  It's just an operation.  But it makes sense that an IProfileApplicationListener should be aware of the impact of changes on the sub-tree, so I don't think this would be a concern.

I mean in a way which wouldn't require patching any generic code listening to the Ecore Feature Package#profileApplications (Such as Databinding used in the properties view - well, bad example, this one is probably still hard-coded; but that's the idea)

It was just a question; I didn't look into the contribution yet, so maybe (probably) it's more complex than that

I don't know exactly where we need to listen on changes on Package#profileApplication (Palette and Properties view are the only examples I can think of right now, and Palette actually needs "allProfileApplication" rather than just "profileApplication").
