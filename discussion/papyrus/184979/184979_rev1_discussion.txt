DESCRIPTION:

Bug 572529: [Properties View] Memory Leak in the DisplayEngine

- dispose the display engine when the editor feeding the Model Explorer
  page is disposed
- uses a new adapter protocol to trace from the current Model Explorer
  page to the editor so that the XWTTabDescriptorProvider can track it

The changes look good to me; except for the small regression where the properties page is sometimes not redrawn at all, after switching between the ModelExplorer view and the Editor, without changing selection
Line:83, plugins/infra/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.properties.ui/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/properties/ui/xwt/XWTTabDescriptorProvider.java -> The problem when you share the same DisplayEngine instance is that views (or pages) are no longer independent. Switching from e.g. the ModelExplorer to the Diagram causes either 1) The view to be refreshed (even though selection didn't change), causing an additional delay or 2) The view to *not* be refreshed, causing a blank properties page

But the delay is not as bad as the memory leak, so I think it's still an improvement overall. The blank properties should be fixed though. It typically happens when switching the focus between the ModelExplorer part and the Diagram Editor, without changing the selection

Line:371, plugins/infra/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.properties.ui/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/properties/ui/xwt/XWTTabDescriptorProvider.java -> Is attachCloseListener necessary here? As far as I can tell, the listener is a no-op for the secondary part

Thanks for the review, Camille. I'll try to dial back the aggressiveness of DisplayEngine disposal as I replied in-line.
Line:83, plugins/infra/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.properties.ui/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/properties/ui/xwt/XWTTabDescriptorProvider.java -> I intended that this change would cause less sharing of the display engine, not more. Its lifecycle is now tied to the editor, of which there are more instances than the Model Explorer.

But, yes, the observed changes in behaviour are not good. I'll see whether perhaps the original lifecycle of the DisplayEngine can be maintained but tracking the editor that owns the editing context to just forget the selection when the editor is closed.

Line:371, plugins/infra/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.properties.ui/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/properties/ui/xwt/XWTTabDescriptorProvider.java -> It's a no-op when the editor is closed, but the secondary part (Model Explorer) could be closed and not the editor, in which case it is still necessary to dispose the DisplayEngine. That's the only case in which previously the DisplayEngine would be disposed, and I think it needs to be maintained.

Line:371, plugins/infra/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.properties.ui/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/properties/ui/xwt/XWTTabDescriptorProvider.java -> I misread the code in the closeListener. For some reason, I thought it was checking if the closed part was the Record's (primary) owner. But that's not what it does, so, ignore my comment :)

Line:371, plugins/infra/properties/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.properties.ui/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/properties/ui/xwt/XWTTabDescriptorProvider.java -> Obviously, I could have written the code more clearly! But I think my new approach to plugging the leak will be able to revert all of this; it will be entirely contained within the DefaultDisplayEngine class.
