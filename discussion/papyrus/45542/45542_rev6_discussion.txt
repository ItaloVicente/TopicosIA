DESCRIPTION:

Bug 446865: lowerValue and upperValue cardinality values not accessible
through UI
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=446865

Manage the multiplicity editor with 2 modes : 
 - The 'simple' mode which allow to edit the lower and upper value in a
single editor
 - The 'advanced' mode which allow to edit the lower and the upper
values in two ValueSpecification editors.
 
The editors of ValueSpecification can be :
 - Simple editor with CLabel
 - XText editor
 - Manage the JUnit tests for the specific lower and upper values
 
The XText editors have some spcifications depending on lower or upper
values :
 - The lower XText ValueSpecification editor always create
LiteralInteger instead of LiteralUnlimitedNatural
 - The upper XText ValueSpecification editor always create
LiteralUnlimitedNatural instead of LiteralInteger when this is possible
(-1 (or *), 0 or positive)
   A validator on the upper value is available for the UnlimitedNatural
help assist
   
Preferences Multiplicity Editor are available to manage the mode
display.

Multiplicity editor help is available in this commit.

Patch Set 6:

Several comments on the functional part (I haven't looked at the code yet):

- When the "Simple" editor is enabled, but an exotic multiplicity is set, the editor is grayed (good) but the displayed text is invalid (e.g. 0..1 instead of MIN..MAX). When the multiplicity is unsupported by the simple editor, it should at least display a specific text (e.g. "Other" or "Unsupported" or "Advanced"). Other improvements could be: 1- Properly display the multiplicity when Literal String are used (Even if it is not editable) 2- Automatically switch to the advanced multiplicity editor for exotic multiplicities
- I couldn't get the XText Multiplicity Editor to work. It properly displays exotic multiplicities, but edit operations do nothing. I think this is a configuration problem: if we use a "generic" XText editor, then the grammar should be a parameter (OK). But in this case, however, we are using an editor specific to the Multiplicity, so it should already know which grammar to use (We shouldn't need to specify the grammar(s) in the *.xwt file). It "could" be a parameter, but it should already have the right default values

Unrelated issue, the validator for multiplicities fails on LiteralStrings: it considers that their int value is 1, so writing 2..MAX causes a validation warning (Lower is greater than upper)

For this improvment, the 'simple' mode of the multiplixity editor will display the 'correct' values of the lower and the upper ValueSpecification (this need to manage the others Literals than LiteralInteger for lowerValue and LiteralUnlimitedNatural for upperValue). The user have to switch manually for the modification of the lower and upper values. Is that seems to be good ?

For the XText editor, the project 'org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.testual.editors.example' will be used (for the example of XText multiplicity editor (on class' property)). Actually, the directEditorConfiguration used is specified in the '*.xwt' file as specified for the ValueSpecification XText editor bug (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=463881). is this not correct ?

Ok, the validation issue will be fixed. But the comparison between the lower and the upper values may be used only when the lowerValue is a LiteralInteger and the upperValue is a LiteralunlimitedNatural ?

Yes

Bug 463881 is about generic XText editors (You don't know which grammar will be used with this widget; it can be used with any grammar). So, having a Grammar parameter makes sense.

The multiplicity editor, on the other hand, only makes sense with a ValueSpecification grammar, so it should be defined by default. It's a minor change, which won't force Properties View Customizer to add the parameters manually (It's always the same grammars, except maybe for some very specific corner cases - in which case having a parameter can be useful. But it shouldn't be mandatory)

> Ok, the validation issue will be fixed. But the comparison between the lower and the upper values may be used only when the lowerValue is a LiteralInteger and the upperValue is a LiteralunlimitedNatural ?

The validation also makes sense for upper = LiteralInteger (Although it is not recommended to use LiteralInteger for Upper value, that's still legal). It should be disabled for all ValueSpecifications which can't be interpreted as Integers
