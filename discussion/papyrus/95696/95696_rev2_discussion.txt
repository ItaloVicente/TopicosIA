DESCRIPTION:

Bug 515257: [Properties] DataSource not reliably disposed when properties section destroyed

Author:    Christian W. Damus <give.a.damus@gmail.com>

Use reference counting to ensure that DataSources are not disposed of
prematurely but in a timely fashion.  Also plug a DataSource leak by
releasing the DataSource removed from the XWTSection's map in the
SWT control dispose listener.

Hi, Klass,

I appreciate that that this is just a back-port of a fix from the Oxygen branch but, as such, it is (I think) more than what is needed for a fix in the Neon maintenance stream.  In particular, whereas in Oxygen it was convenient for the DataSource to change its inheritance hierarchy to specialize ReferenceCounted, this API change is not necessary for the fix and so is more than we should do on the maintenance branch.

I think it should be necessary only to plug the hole in the DefaultDisplayEngine where a control dispose listener previously was not disposing the DataSource to just do that here.  Without changing the API of the DataSource class.  What do you say?

Hi Christian,

Thx for the feedback! I haven't looked at the patch, so I don't know how _bad_ the API change is, and what is the most pragmatic solution.

Do you have a clue if someone else could/would be negatively affected by the non-necessary changes?

I haven't any clue, which is exactly the point of the API evolution policies:  because it's public API, we have to assume that anyone may be affected, so if it's not necessary to change it, it's better not to (for bug fixes in a maintenance context).

I can work up a revision that I think should fix the bug with minimal impact.  Would you mind testing that when it's ready?
