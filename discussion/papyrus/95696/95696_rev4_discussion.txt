Hi Christian, 
Thx for the patch!  I've just installed a patched version of org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.properties.ui in my local installation, and will stress test it during the next week or so!

Hi Christian, seems like we had some kind of gerrit "mid-air collision", I was just answering your previous question :-)
As the problem occurs randomly and I have no consistent way of reproducing, I'm planning to evaluate a patched version of the plugin during some time!

Thanks again for the patch!

So far, I have not seen the exception mentioned in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=508278#c4 anymore when working on my SysML model (and trying various 'delete' operations), so LOOKS GOOD TO ME.
