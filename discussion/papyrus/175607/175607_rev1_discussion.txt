Patch Set 1:

This gerrit is based on gerrit 174817, so it is bigger than expected. 
This only contains latest evolutions of the static profile plugin validation and quick fixes, based on the improvement on the toolsmith validation framework.

Hi, Rémi. There are 180 files in this diff that are already merged to the target branch and are not relevant. I don't know why Gerrit cannot resolve those, but it was too much cruft to wade through so I rebased your branch and posted another patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/papyrus/org.eclipse.papyrus/+/176048 (the rebase had no conflicts to resolve). Please see that for comments and consider abandoning this patch.
