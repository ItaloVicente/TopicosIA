DESCRIPTION:

Bug 512554 - [Architecture-General] No Disable Workspace Model Indexer facility

- Start indexing in the moment that a first demand for an index is done, i.e. in the moment that a first Papyrus
  model is opened. This avoids that the installation of Papyrus has an impact on users that use is only
  sporadically. Before, indexing was alredy started by the Activator.
- Wait with a 5 seconds timeout for a lock. This avoids deadlocks as in comment 3 of bug 512554 (and bug 507024)

I'm not sure what problem we are solving, here.  If Papyrus is not in use, then presumably its plug-ins are not activated, and the indexing subsystem would not be doing anything, right?  And if Papyrus is in use, then the indexing is needed to support decorator models (externalized profile applications) and sub-models.

But in any case this change is missing a lot of APIs that would need to lazily start up the indexing manager.  For example, the Decorator Model decorations in the Project Explorer won't appear until something trips across the getRoots() method that is the only trigger to start indexing.
Line:384, plugins/infra/emf/org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.emf/src/org/eclipse/papyrus/infra/emf/internal/resource/AbstractCrossReferenceIndex.java -> There are *lots* of other APIs that depend on the indexing having been started, not only in this class, but in the Decorator Model Index ad the Profile Index.

Patch Set 1:

The problem is that the indexer currently starts very easily. It starts as soon as the workspace is non empty, i.e. it is not necessary to have a UML model in the workspace. While the resource consumption for indexing is probably not very high (in particular if there are no or a small amount of UML models available), this might annoy users that rarely use Papyrus. They have to de-install it completely to avoid that the indexer starts working.

Another (more critical) problem is that there are sometimes UI freezes caused by the indexer that (on my machine) are always related to the locking of the indexer, as shown in comment 3 of the bug. It was perhaps not a good idea to mix these two issues and keep the freeze in bug 507024.

I would not mind, if some decorations in the project explorer are unavailable, until a model is actually open.

That sounds like a more general problem in Papyrus's eager activation of bundles when they are not needed, then.

Yes, the time-out should help this.  That's fine.

That was an example that came readily to mind, and we have users that may be confused about what resources to open if they all look the same.  But anyways, I don't know what other potential impact there is now of the indexer not being available.  Do you?  Is there a more reliable trigger that can be found that clearly indicates user intent to work with Papyrus models, at which point indexing can be started?  That would be satisfactory.
