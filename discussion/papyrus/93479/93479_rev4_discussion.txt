DESCRIPTION:

Bug 512554 - [Architecture-General] No Disable Workspace Model Indexer facility

- Start indexing in the moment that a first demand for an index (instance of class CrossReferenceIndex) is done.

- The ControlledUnitLabelDecorator is already used earlier (if the project explorer is
  open). With the patch, it will only start decorating, once indexing has been started, i.e. a
  Papyrus model is opened. This means that decorations are available late, but avoids starting
  the indexer almost immediately (for sporadic Papyrus users)

- Increase wait timeout added in bug 512554: otherwise we might run regularly into a
  timeout due to class loading delays

Hi Christian,

thanks for the +1. In addition to this gerrit, we should fix the reproducible timeout with another patch. Thus, it would be good, if you can verify that you can reproduce the timeout as well in the two models scenario described in my latest bugzilla comment (and eventually provide a fix, but I can also look into it).

My first analysis: The code (within IndexManager) "Job.getJobManager().join(IndexManager.this, monitor);" blocks and therefore the get for the associated future runs into a timeout.

The last two comments rather refer to bug 507024 (deadlock, resolved by timeout) rather than this one.
