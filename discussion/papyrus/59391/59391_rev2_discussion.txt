DESCRIPTION:

Bug 481149: [ModelSet] Model snippets added after a model has loaded are never started
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=481149

Ensure that model snippets are started as soon as they are added, if the
model has already been loaded.

Also fix the omission of snippet starting on creation (not loading) of
a new model.
