Line:222, plugins/uml/diagram/org.eclipse.papyrus.uml.diagram.sequence/custom-src/org/eclipse/papyrus/uml/diagram/sequence/edit/policies/DurationLinkSelectionHandlesEditPolicy.java -> Oh, I forgot one thing in the ticket: the conversion is required for Zoom, but also for Viewport translation (ie. diagram Scrollbars)
This conversion works fine for Zoom when the Viewport is at 0;0, but doesn't work when the Viewport is scrolled

What is typically required is:

- Translate the figure bounds to Absolute
- Add the move delta to the translated Absolute bounds
- Convert the result back to Relative

Or, more generally:

- Convert everything to absolute
- Apply operations on absolute values
- Convert the result back to relative

As opposed to converting everything to relative, and applying operations on relative values (In that case, the viewport translation is applied twice, because you apply it on the Move Delta during translateToRelative. So if you scrolled your viewport by 100px, and have a moveDelta of 0;0, translate to relative will give a moveDelta of 100; 0, which you add to your current delta)

The term Absolute/Relative is a little bit confusing, because "Absolute" actually means "Relative to the current viewport's 0; 0 point", which is a moving target (It's the top-left visible point of the Editor, so if you scroll or zoom, all absolute coordinates change, but relative coordinates remain the same). Relative means relative to the 0; 0 point of the Diagram (Or relative to the parent's 0; 0 point in some cases, although we tend to avoid that for Figures - we do serialize relative to parent though).
