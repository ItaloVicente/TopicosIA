I don't understand how it works/should work.

No matter how I set the preferences, I can't get the Java Editor to open (OCL always has a higher priority for some reason), even if the constraint has no defined language

Additionally, the preference page is very fragile: if I change the priority for the Java editor, then go to the OCL editor and change something there, then come back to the Java Editor, my previous changes are lost. You need to click "Apply" after each change otherwise the modifications are lost

Priorities should be defined at the metaclass level (e.g. Constraint), and the priority mechanism should be invoked if more than one Additional Constraint matches.

Additionally, using Labels rather than IDs for serializing the preferences is a little bit fragile (Changing the displayed label would break the preferences), but that's a minor issue (and too late to be changed)

Line:10, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.extensionpoints.editors/model/EmbeddedEditorPreferences.ecore -> Having EClass as a supertype seems highly suspicious (Similar to extending java.lang.Class). What is the intention here?

Line:11, plugins/infra/gmfdiag/org.eclipse.papyrus.extensionpoints.editors/model/EmbeddedEditorPreferences.genmodel -> The convention for EMF is to use the name of the EClass (Without the "I" prefix). Let's stick to that convention

After analysis, it seems that the generation template was not modified to use new preferences mechanism and this is why you have always default direct editor.
