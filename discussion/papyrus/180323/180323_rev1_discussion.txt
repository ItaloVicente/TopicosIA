This builder is a bit brutal, assuming that all EMF Models are XMI files. I was starting to wonder if it even makes sense, but since it's only configured for Papyrus plug-ins (or Toolsmiths plug-ins), I think the side-effects would be quite limited. Although, I can imagine that a Papyrus plug-in that would make heavy use of XText would be hit by a lot of similar exceptions.

A more general alternative would be to modify getXMLImportedMetamodelNsURI, to check if the Resource is actually an XMLResource

That's a good point. This is a useful backstop in any case; I'll add it. I would be tempted also to filter on content types based on the XML type, but I think not enough models actually generate EMF's support for content types. So in the interest of minimizing the possible impact of a fix, I'll just add the a posteriori check for XMLResource.
