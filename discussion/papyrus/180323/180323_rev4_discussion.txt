I think the intermittent failure of this one Architecture Builder test happens because in the Maven
build the ordering of tests is such that the "representationKindReferenced" test runs before the "unusedRepresentationKind" test *and* sometimes there's a delay in the Architecture Manager getting notified of preferences changes to find out that an Architecture resource registered by the former to "fix" the problem detected by the latter means that the latter actually doesn't see any problem because the Architecture resource that has the viewpoint referencing the representation kind is still in the system, though it should not be.

So, I've worked around this by telling JUnit to execute the tests in the order that they are defined in the source. This isn't great, but it is more expedient than deeper messing about with Eclipse Preferences.
