Some comments:
- I would like Camille to do some review on the code, as he already has done some review on it
- There is an official dependency added towards jdt. This could be a problem, no?
- There are some classes coming from IBM contributions (one being a 'package' visible  class). Is this necessary to duplicate classes? If yes, perhaps it would be nice to change the visibility of the classes to public instead of packages. In we have to change more code, it would be nice to update copyrights.
