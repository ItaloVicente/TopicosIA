DESCRIPTION:

& test if a Style feature is set/unset

Patch Set 3:

Patch Set 3 adds support for the isVisible feature, which is not part of the Style API, but is still implemented with CSS.

There are a few inconsistencies (in Papyrus) in the way Styles/Views/Style Views are implemented, especially for the Views that are not Styles (DecorationNode, Diagram, Node, Edge); but these views properly implement CSSView(.Internal). They don't necessarily have the eGetRaw() switch method (Which was implemented for CSSStyle, and not for CSSView), but:

- Most views also implement style (Shape, Connector), so they'll get access to all features via eGetRaw (including isVisible)
- If a view doesn't implement style, then the eGetRaw() would have only one switch-case entry, for isVisibleRaw (So client-side code never needs to implement its own switch-case, even when it's not present in the Papyrus code)

So if we want to retrieve the raw value for a Style, we can use eGetRaw(); for a View that is also a Style we can use eGetRaw as well (And it will include a case for isVisible); for a View that isn't a style we need to use isVisibleRaw() directly.
