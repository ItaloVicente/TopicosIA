DESCRIPTION:

Bug 551740: [AF][validation] we must check that all representation are referenced by a viewpoint

- add a custom validation rule to the architecture validation builder
  to check for references from some viewpoint to a representation kind
- requires augmentation of the ArchitectureIndex to look for internal
  cross-references within the architecture models, not just external
  cross-references from architecture models to other tooling models
- the latter motivated encapsulating some more friendly APIs in
  the ArchitectureIndex
- and also is based on a new reusable InternalCrossReferencer utility
- minor fixes to bundle metadata of some test projects files
