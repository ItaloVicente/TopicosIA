DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533679: Creation of CFrag should not graphically move elements

Fix the handling of operand ownership for execution specifications
to account for (a) that they are not started/finished only by
ExecutionOccurrenceSpecifications specifically and (b) that they
are not always provided by the rows of the grid model.

Since the updating of the rows and columns and fragment ownership
is so often done in a read-only context (following operation
execution on the history) we can avoid redundant calculations
by just always posting the update asynchronously and throttling
multiple pending calculations.

Altogether this results in the calculation of operand ownership
upon initial creation of a combined fragment not being immediately
overridden by an incorrect calculation that puts all of the
fragments back into the root interaction.

This change fixes the test failures indicated by Camille in patch 123340 by removing the compounding of SetCommands in the ComputeOwnerHelper and reverting to case-by-case execution.  Subsequent commands depend on the execution of previous commands.

Works for me; I've also checked with Gerrit 123340 for Bug 535097 and everything's fine :)
