DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533679: Creation of CFrag should not graphically move elements

Fix the handling of operand ownership for execution specifications
to account for (a) that they are not started/finished only by
ExecutionOccurrenceSpecifications specifically and (b) that they
are not always provided by the rows of the grid model.

Since the updating of the rows and columns and fragment ownership
is so often done in a read-only context (following operation
execution on the history) we can avoid redundant calculations
by just always posting the update asynchronously and throttling
multiple pending calculations.

Altogether this results in the calculation of operand ownership
upon initial creation of a combined fragment not being immediately
overridden by an incorrect calculation that puts all of the
fragments back into the root interaction.

> Uploaded patch set 4.

Rebased onto the latest patch for bug 533676, which is in public review, with also some additional fixes to missed validation triggers and a generalization of the asynchronous command execution based on the OneShotExecutor to avoid redundant asynchronous validations in a better way than the patch for bug 533675 (but which will conflict with that patch).
