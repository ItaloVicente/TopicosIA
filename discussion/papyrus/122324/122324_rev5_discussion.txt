DESCRIPTION:

Bug 533679: Creation of CFrag should not graphically move elements

Fix the handling of operand ownership for execution specifications
to account for (a) that they are not started/finished only by
ExecutionOccurrenceSpecifications specifically and (b) that they
are not always provided by the rows of the grid model.

Since the updating of the rows and columns and fragment ownership
is so often done in a read-only context (following operation
execution on the history) we can avoid redundant calculations
by just always posting the update asynchronously and throttling
multiple pending calculations.

Altogether this results in the calculation of operand ownership
upon initial creation of a combined fragment not being immediately
overridden by an incorrect calculation that puts all of the
fragments back into the root interaction.

This looks good to me.  I'd like to complete the internal review and publish this ASAP, as it addresses some issues identified by Nicolas in his review of bug 533676 and also some JUnit test failures now manifest in the master branch.

Looks good to me. It's going to conflict with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/123340/ but I can check that later

Patch Set 5: -Code-Review

Actually, I'm not too sure about this. While investigating the test failures in my patch after I merge it with this one, I noticed that some tests do not always pass (And it seems to affect my tests, too). Unfortunately, I've not found the cause of the issue yet.
When creating a new InteractionOperand in an existing CF, it seems that the fragments are not always properly updated. Sometimes they are, sometimes not.

The validation tests for 533676 also fails sometimes (Not sure if that was already the case before this patch? I'm still running some tests to check when it started to fail, but since the failures don't always happen, it's time-consuming)

So:

- With 122324/5 only, I get some random test failures on the validation tests for 533676
- With 12324/5 rebased on master, and including my patch for 535097 (Gerrit 123340), I get some test failures in my new tests (And it seems that the CreateOperand test also fails randomly)
- I'm still running the tests on master to see if the random failures are already present there, or if they are caused by this patch

Actually, the validation errors also occur on master, so it's not caused by this patch.
I'm now running the new tests from Gerrit 123340 to see if the failures were already present as well...
