Line:4642, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Adding 0xFF in front doesn't seem to make sense. I notice that with "file names first" I get

  missing - some/sub
  missing - some/sub/dir

but with "file names first" off I get first all files in some/sub/dir and then all those in some/sub (which I personally find strange, but it's what "git status" also shows, so it's OK).

Also, what's the desired order if I also have

  missing
  missing - some/suba
  missing - some/subškoda
  missing - some/sub/škoda

I have the feeling that one can't get a consistent ordering with more "magic" characters. Perhaps use the category also for alphabetic sort? (I don't care whether some/sub comes before some/sub/dir or the other way around. But some/suba should not come in between?)

Line:4642, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Having 0xFF in front does not make a difference in the list views, but in the tree views only, where folders are compared against files.

But agreed, I don't like those magic characters as well.

Instead, I'm going to try to utilize StagingViewContentProvider$EntryComparator (with added support for state order) by StagingView$StagingEntryComparator for the real comparison.
Once the virtual tree does work, the StagingView$StagingEntryComparator is obsolete anyway, but meanwhile I want to keep the non-virtual tree intact.

I missed that :-) But that's a perfect example of using the category(). Folders are one category, files another, and folders always sort before files.

mh, not yet - will do that during the virtual tree refactoring.
