DESCRIPTION:

Don't interrupt user on first keystroke

The Push Commit... dialog always interrupted the user after the first
keystroke in the Target Ref Name field. To avoid this, we pre-fetch the
remote refs in the background.

The pushMode is now passed in the constructor of
RefContentAssistProvider. This fixes a latent bug in the caching story
of getRefsForContentAssist(boolean): Caches didn't distinguish
pushModes.

Sorry about the compile errors. I was a victim of https://bugs.eclipse.org/385472 .

There are two problems:

1) fetchJob.getResult() != Status.OK_STATUS
This condition is wrong: if the job ends with an error, then it will report an error on each key stroke (log and maybe also a dialog).

2) When the job got cancelled (for whatever reason) we should probably scheduled it again.


I know you hate it, but if you could add your credentials to each file (or add "and others."), it would save me some cycles.

My concern on this patch is that it doesn't give a visual hint to user about whether assistance is available or not.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Thomas Wolf has been reworking the push branch dialog recently to get rid of the modal dialog. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/topic:push-branch-wizard+(status:open+OR+status:merged) or https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=530685

This issue should probably tackled again using the same approach as in the above mentioned change.

@Thomas: do you think you're likely to work on this bug and implement the same behavior as for the other dialog? If so, should we abandon this proposed patch?

TL;DR: yes and yes.

Long version:

Yes, RefSpecDialog is next on my list. From a quick glance it appears that this patch here would simply pre-fetch the refs, but content assist itself is still synchronous. So if getting the remote refs hasn't finished by the time the content assist is triggered, the user is still blocked (and still gets an unnecessary annoying blocking popup).

The newer approach I have been developing and that is already in the "Fetch From Gerrit..." wizard for quite some time makes the whole content assist truly asynchronous.

So I think this patch is obsolete and can be abandoned.

Abandoned

This code is obsolete. The SimplePushRefWizard was removed in 2014; the functionality is nowadays in PushBranchWizard. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/28051/.

The content assist on the PushBranchPage from that change is being made fully asynchronous in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/116676/ . RefSpecDialog will follow.
