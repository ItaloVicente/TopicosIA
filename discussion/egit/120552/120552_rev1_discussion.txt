DESCRIPTION:

Show affected projects when deleting repository

Have a list of projects being deleted underneath the checkbox for
confirming project deletion. The height is fixed to 100 pixels (6 lines
on my machine), vertical scrolling is possible after checking the
checkbox. A screenshot is in bugzilla.

This changes the API of the RemoveCommand, I'm not sure what that means
for versioning.

Looks mostly good, just two minor things.
Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> First, it changes the API of the dialog, and second, this doesn't affect versioning at all since it's internal.

Line:138, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/DeleteRepositoryConfirmDialog.java -> How about having the table always enabled? First, if there are more projects than can be shown, I'd like to able to scroll and check before checking the "Remove projects" checkbox. Second, if it's not always enabled, I would have expected it to be disabled also if the checkbox is disabled (even if checked).

Being able to select a project in that table is slightly confusing, but it's probably too much work to suppress selections (and possibly focus rectangles) altogether.

Line:201, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/DeleteRepositoryConfirmDialog.java -> Maybe use !projectsToDelete.isEmpty()?

Line:138, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/DeleteRepositoryConfirmDialog.java -> Using the list even without the checkbox checked sounds reasonable, even though the visual appearance seemed better when it was disabled initially.

Line:201, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/DeleteRepositoryConfirmDialog.java -> Sure. This was an occurrence of just fixing the compiler error by adding ".size" instead of really thinking about it. My fault.
