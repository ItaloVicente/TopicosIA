DESCRIPTION:

Fix commit amend to show full commit when clicking "amend" option

In the Git Staging view, when editing an existing commit, it should be
possible to re-edit all details of a commit. This includes not only the
commit message, but also all file additions, modifications and
deletions. Therefore, the "Staged Changes" file list should list the
changes that happened in the commit that is being edited.

This introduces two new test failures:
org.eclipse.egit.ui.test.stagview.StagingViewTest.testAmend
org.eclipse.egit.ui.test.stagview.StagingViewTest.testMergeConflict

I debugged org.eclipse.egit.ui.test.stagview.StagingViewTest.testAmend assuming that only the test needs adjustment but it looks to me that the implementation "looses" the direct successor commit. 

A->B-C and if you amend C you end up with A->C'. 

@Matthias, I think you need to review the implementation again.

Adding Thomas in the hope that he is interest to help. This feature would simplify the workflow for removing accidently added files.

I see several problems that would need to be solved here:

* resetting HEAD to HEAD~ should most definitely not be done while we're rebasing or in a rebase/merge conflict state.
* when the commit runs, it'll run with "amend" true. That assumes that HEAD is on the commit being amended, not on its first parent. (That's the source of the "missing parent commit" mentioned in previous commits.)
* The remembered commit to be amended probably should be re-set if HEAD changes in the meantime.

One more item: the commit button should be disabled while the soft reset runs. Otherwise who knows what will be committed.

Playing more with this, I don't think changing HEAD is the right approach. It actually changes the current branch, and we'd have a ton of use cases where we'd have to make sure we undo this before doing anything else.
Line:3115, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Also, I think this logic is wrong. Currently I can click "Amend" and then switch to another branch, and the staging view updates correctly. With this change, it doesn't. The commit message remains. Moreover, because of the soft reset, I end up with the same unstaged changes on the new branch.
