Not good. This build packaged the JGit m2 JARs into the update site. It also ran the build against JGit m2. And that now causes the trouble in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/simrel/org.eclipse.simrel.build/+/181081 .

I don't see how this could have happened. The JGit build appears to have run and completed before this job started... though it's hard to tell with all the different time zones used by Gerrit, Jenkins, and maven. But probably it'd be wise to tighten the checks in the build scripts and require exactly matching suffixes for the -m and -r builds.

In any case it looks like this job should be retriggered.

Crap. Retriggering doesn't work because m3 is already published to Nexus. It did pick up the correct JGit m3, though.

How does one "un-publish" something from Nexus? Is it good enough to just rm -rf the .../5.12.0.202105261145-m3/ directories? Or is there a --force option for publishing?

BTW: the only explanation for the first build having used JGit M2 is that the release tag in JGit was pushed to the Gerrit JGit repo only after that EGit build had started.

If [1] is correct only a Nexus admin could do this.

yes, I guess I pushed the JGit tag too late.
I will write down detailed steps to create a release so that I don't miss this next time.

yes, release artefacts are supposed to be final.

At SAP we prevent this scenario by pushing release builds first to a Nexus staging repository and only when validation of all release artefacts was successful we release the staging repository.
Otherwise the staging repo is dropped which can be done by developers.

This staging feature is only available in the commercial Nexus Pro version [2].

Shall I make the EGit builds require the same suffixes? I.e., an egit build for *-m3 would fail if it didn't find a *-m3 upstream tag? Currently that's only done for -r, but we could do it also for the -m[123] and -r[12] cases.

Another idea for the EGit builds might be to not rely on a tag in the upstream repo but enumerate the versions published at Nexus and take the latest matching one from there. Then it doesn't matter at all when the tag is pushed, or if there is a tag at all. Would have to look how one enumerates versions via some Nexus API, though. I presume it has some endpoint for this that we could call via curl.

Best I can find is [1], but that still leaves us with XML parsing, and the URL isn't very convenient to derive.
