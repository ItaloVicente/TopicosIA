nice :-)

I think it's a good idea to have predefined common entries which can be selected in the drop down of the toolbar button. In the "Ref filter..." dialog I would suggest to show these predefined (and not removable) patterns with grey text color to make clear they are predefined and cannot be removed. And I would remove the text "(preconfigured)" since the different text color already shows these entries are different.

Maybe we could add content assist when the user edits an entry in the ref filter dialog which proposes predefined entries and the list of existing refs matching the text which was already entered. 

In addition we could add actions on branches/tags shown in the repositories view to select/deselect refs to be used in the history view's ref filter. And we could add menu actions on the ref widgets displayed in the history view to enable a more intuitive point and select way to adjust the ref filter.

The toolbar button can toggle between 2 filter settings. But it does not change appearance between these 2 states. I think it should appear like an unpressed toggle button when only showing HEAD and it should appear like a pressed toggle button for the other state.

The "Add Ref..." button in the Ref Filter dialog seems not to have any effect yet.

It seems that "Set defaults" in the ref filter dialog depends on the current toggle state and sometimes selects only HEAD. I think it should always set the predefined settings "refs/tags/**:HEAD:refs/heads/**:refs/remotes/**"

I will do the coloring. But I think more discussion is needed before removing the "(preconfigured)" (see comment of Thomas)

I will look into this. Do you think any of these are required for this to be a "good" contribution which can be merged? Otherwise I'd propose to do these in a follow up change.

I totally agree and already tried to do this. But as far as I understood, this is currently not possible with org.eclipse.jface.action.Action, because it can either have the style AS_DROP_DOWN_MENU or AS_CHECK_BOX, not both.

This is weird. It should open a Ref Selection Dialog for the current repository. We need to look into this. But I don't really know how to start.

Actually it should always restore to the state where only HEAD is selected. Did you experience a situation where this is not the case?
Reasoning: This is also the default with the old system (toggle between HEAD and all branches and tags).
The string "refs/tags/**:HEAD:refs/heads/**:refs/remotes/**" is only the default for the *last* selected refs, so the state to which is returned, if the toolbar button is pressed, while only HEAD is selected. This is also currently never set to default, will need to look into when to set this to default.
