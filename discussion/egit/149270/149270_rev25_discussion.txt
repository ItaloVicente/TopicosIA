bot.waitUntil will also timeout at some point (default is also 5 seconds, but I don't know if the default is used here).

Andreys suggestion was to increase the timeout for waitForJobs to something like 30 seconds as well as adding a log message to waitForJobs to log when the timeout is hit.

One more advantage of your version I just noticed is that there is no need to wait an arbitrary time (50ms) for the job to enter the queue.

I'm not sure which version is really the better solution.

We set that timout to 30s in the root pom.xml: -Dorg.eclipse.swtbot.search.timeout=30000

But at the end of the day all I can say is that I've fixed numerous unstable tests in EGit by not using waitForJobs but waiting for better defined events to occur. So far bot.waitUntil() has never let me down. Perhaps waitForJobs sometimes doesn't wait long enough?
