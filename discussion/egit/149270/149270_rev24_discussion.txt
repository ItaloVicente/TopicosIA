Yes. Avoid arbitrarily timed waits. I've removed most of them in PS 24.

If this build succeeds, I'll go create the CQ.

I don't really see waitForJobs as an arbitrarily timed wait ...
But if you think your suggestion is more stable than mine, I'm ok with it.
Line:618, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/history/HistoryViewTest.java -> Shouldn't this be removed as it was replaced by bot.waitUntil()?

Line:623, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/history/HistoryViewTest.java -> What if the table is supposed to get shorter before this assertCommitsAfterBase? I'd suggest (table.rowCount() == commitMsgs.length + 3)

Line:628, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/history/HistoryViewTest.java -> This should be something like CommitGraphTable did not get expected length

It is because it'll just stop after 5 seconds. May take longer on Jenkins.
Line:618, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/history/HistoryViewTest.java -> I didn't dare do that. The table might already contain enough entries before it is reloaded. Since the history table loads asynchronously and is notoriously difficult to test, I left this one in.

Line:623, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/history/HistoryViewTest.java -> Done

Line:628, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/history/HistoryViewTest.java -> Done
