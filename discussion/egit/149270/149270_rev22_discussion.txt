Matthias, would be good to have CQ soon. Do you have time to do that, or instructions how to file one?

OK, I saw now the comment 1 and PDF file there (Figure 2) says:

"Written 100% by employees of the same employer as the Submitting Committer: (a)
under the supervision of the PMC; and (b) where the employer has signed a Member committer Agreement."

Yes
Tim and me are employee by Advantest. I have committer rights on egit, and Advantest is a member of Eclipse foundation.

"Confirm that the Contribution:
1. Contains No Cryptography
2. Is Developed from Scratch (without
incorporating content from
elsewhere) – Contact the EMO if
you aren’t sure.
3. Is 100% Project License Code
"

Yes

"Create about.html (if required) & commit to the
repository. Don’t forget to record the
contribution in your Project IP Log!"

Not sure what the last sentence means, but does this all above mean, we do not need to file CQ and can simply commit?

No. You must start at figure 3 in the poster ("Submitting Contributor (Non-Committer)"), and you'll end up in "Everything else".

If Tim had been a committer when he pushed PS 1, we could have started at figure 1 and no CQ would be needed.

If _you_ had pushed PS 1 _and_ Advantest had signed an MCA, start point would be figure 2 and again no CQ would be needed. Advantest may be a member of the Eclipse Foundation, but are you and Tim contributing under a Member Committer Agreement (MCA)[1] that Advantest signed? I for one am covered by an Individual Committer Agreement plus a Committer Employer Consent, but no MCA.

I can create the CQ once the "throw NPE" is cleaned up.
