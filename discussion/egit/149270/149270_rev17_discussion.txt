Line:24, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/DynamicActionContributionItem.java -> I wonder if delegation is worth avoiding that pesky "illegally extends ActionContributionItem" warning in Eclipse which occurs only because someone in the dim past thought slapping a @noextend on it was a good idea. EGit already "illegally" extends some other JFace classes, and there's also bug 538077.

I'd just have subclassing and overridden isDynamic().

And perhaps it's a mistake anyway to return false from ActionContributionItem.isDynamic(); if they check for style changes for menu items, then why not for toolbar buttons?

Probably you could do a similar optimization here and return true only if the style really changed.

Line:84, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryWalk.java -> Unrelated to this change, but something for a follow-up: I think we might drop this config and menu item? Personally I've never used it, and the "notes" I get when I enable it don't really tell much. If someone really wants that, he could configure "refs/notes/**" explicitly now.

Line:38, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/SWTWalk.java -> JDT formatting doesn't work right with these annotations. Use "final @NonNull Repository repo", or drop the "final" altogether.

Flipping the button style makes the buttons jump around. (OS X) Not a good idea IMO.

But anyway: behavior before was that even in "HEAD only" mode, if I openened the drop-down menu and checked "refs/remotes/**", it _would_ take effect. Also, if I chose "Ref Filters..." and then clicked OK, it would take effect immediately. Even when in first-parent mode.

That's no longer the case.

Andrey's comment was only about the behavior when first-parent mode was _also_ switched on. In that case something like

  @Override
  public void runWithEvent(Event event) {
    if (event.detail == SWT.ARROW && historyPage.isShowFirstParentOnly()) {
      return;
    }
    super.runWithEvent(event);
  }

would disable the drop-down menu. (Leaves the triangle visible, though, but nothing happens when clicked.)

But why that would need changing at all is beyond me. For me changing settings from the drop-down menu took effect immediately, also when currently showing "HEAD only" and with first-parent mode switched on.

I would suggest to undo these toolbar button changes.

Can confirm: The buttons move (under linux/kde).

Yes that is correct. But Andrey thought that this is confusing and it would be better (more understandable) to forbid changing the "complicated" filter while in "HEAD only" mode. First-parent mode has nothing to do with this. With "single branch" Andrey meant "HEAD only". 

 > That's no longer the case.

Correct.

I think you misunderstood what Andrey meant.

This is debatable. What are your opinions Andrey, Matthias, Michael?

Oh. Well, even in that "mode", changes made through the drop-down menu took effect immediately (regradless of first-parent mode). So I don't see why one should disable the drop-down in "HEAD history only mode".

To clarify: my suggestion is to undo the drop-down menu disabling/style flip. Keep changing the icon and tooltip. (Both can be done without toolbar.update().)

OK, looks like I also misunderstood that being in HEAD only mode and selecting *any* of the checkboxes automatically switches to the ALL branches mode. This was probably due missing icon change.

Please note: if we are in ALL branches mode and uncheck everything except HEAD we should change the button state/icon back to the HEAD only mode.

So I'm fine with one combo for both modes.
