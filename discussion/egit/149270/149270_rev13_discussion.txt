Great :-)

One thing that totally confused me first: the drop down and "Ref Filters..." menu should be disabled if we are in the "single branch" mode, otherwise user sees in the dialog configuration, changes something, but nothing happens.

Same with the icon: should be clear that we are in the single vs multiple branch modes.

The rest is genius!

Cool!
Can't wait to get this merged!

First impressions; no code review yet: looks cool. Some things I noticed:

* I often work with several repos. Sometimes even with many. I find it tedious having to set my preferred setting ("Show all branches and tags") each and every time via the drop-down menu enabling all of refs/{heads,remotes,tags}/** . I'd keep that preference in the history preference page and would use it to define the default setings when the user hasn't configured anything on a repo. If the user previously had set "Show all branches and tags" and then upgrades, he'll be rather surprised to only get the history of HEAD.

* The tooltip on the button should say what it'll do. It toggles between "history of HEAD only" and "history of all configured refs". So it should say something like "Show History of HEAD" and "Show History of Configured Refs". The other tooltips, BTW, are using title case.

* In the configuration dialog, "Add Ref..." only does something when there's a selection in the table.

Impressive work overall.
