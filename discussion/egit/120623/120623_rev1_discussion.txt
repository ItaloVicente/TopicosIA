DESCRIPTION:

Improve check for uncommitted changes before cherry-pick

First, give the dialog an appropriate title. The default title
mentions rebasing, which is confusing when the user tries to
cherry-pick.

Second, limit the check to files in the diff to be applied. This
allows the cherry-pick to proceed successfully in a lot more cases.
The behavior is then more in line with rebasing or checking out,
which also can succeed if the working tree is dirty.

Line:141, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/UIRepositoryUtils.java -> It would save you from doing unnecessary parseCommit() calls if you would do:

  RevCommit parent;
  if (noParents > 1 ... ) {
    parent = repo.parseCommit(commit.getParent(parentIndex));
  } else {
    parent = repo.parseCommit(commit.getParent(0));
  }

Line:167, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/UIRepositoryUtils.java -> I think this is an improvement, so +1. But it is still not like native git. Native git is clever to find out which paths have to be touched during a cherry-pick. For paths which don't have to be touched a dirty worktree will not stop the cherry-pick. In 99% of the cases the list of paths which have to be touched is the list you determine here: based on the diff of the commit against his parent. But when the commit you cherry pick changed the content of /a from x to z but the branch onto which you want to cherry pick already has the content z for file /a .... then a dirty worktree for /a will not stop native git from cherry-picking. At least in this example

  > git init
  ...
  > echo initialA >a
  > echo initialB >b
  > git add .
  > git commit -m initial
  > git branch side
  > echo masterA >a
  > echo masterB >b
  > git commit -a -m mod_a_b_master
  [master d68132e] mod_a_b_master

   1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

Line:167, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/UIRepositoryUtils.java -> All right. In that case, let's try something else; see patch set 2. We just do the operation, and if it complains about a dirty index or working tree, only then do we ask the user to clean up, and if he does, we then re-do the operation.
