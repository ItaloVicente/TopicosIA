DESCRIPTION:

[repo groups] RepositoryGroupNode: store model object instead of label

Fix equals(), hashCode(), and compareTo() for RepositoryGroupNodes:
these should store the RepositoryGroup, not the label as their object.
Remove the then superfluous getGoup() method; use getObject() instead.
equals() must compare the repo groups. compareTo() is used only for
sorting, so it may compare by group name.

Fix the label provider: the workbench adapter must return a label
text, which is the group's name.

Line:231, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoryTreeNodeWorkbenchAdapter.java -> We can remove this, add the 4 missing labels, and throw an IllegalStateException outside the switch. That way the compiler would tell us, if we miss another case in the future. I always use that technique at work and it saved us several times when extending enums.

What do you think? Should we use that in egit code, too? If so, we could introduce it independently of your change.

Line:179, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryTreeNode.java -> Independent of your change: I find this implementation generally confusing. If I get it right, the basic idea is to calculate the hash based on the type of myObject. So why don't we actually just write that?

  if (myObject instanceof Repository) {
    result = ...
  } else if (myObject instanceof Ref) {
    // handle ADDITONALREF specially
    result = ...
  } else if (myObject instanceof File) {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }

That would avoid the somewhat hard check of whether all enum cases are considered.

Line:231, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoryTreeNodeWorkbenchAdapter.java -> Sounds good.

Line:179, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryTreeNode.java -> It's probably not written that way because it uses these enum switches elsewhere. Don't know why it's written that way at all; it's not very object-oriented. Why doesn't each subclass implement equals & hashcode as needed? To capture commonalities, one could have abstract classes in the hierarchy.

compareTo is also a bit strange; probably doesn't always always agree with equals. (Not sure, didn't check.) Doesn't matter since it's used only for sorting, but having that in a separate comparator would be nicer.

The content provider sorts anyway IIRC. Maybe we could drop that if all viewers showing these nodes got proper ViewerComparators.
