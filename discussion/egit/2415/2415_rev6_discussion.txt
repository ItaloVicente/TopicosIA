I agree with Matthias' suggestions. Please update with a new changeset.

I also refactored a couple classes out and collapsed things into DiscardChangesOperation.

I would also request that you do the tests in another gerrit changeset so we can avoid triggering the IP process for this.

this feature was already implemented by change I0beef8da40c8e0c194f61678000f0b65bd6598b9 hence abandoning this duplicate

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:196, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/DiscardChangesOperation.java -> I think this code should be in JGit. What you suggest is a "git checkout -- <path>", right? That's pure git logic and we should try to  keep such things in JGit. A good place for that would be in  CheckoutCommand. If we would add a method "addPath(String path)" there then we could move this code to the right location. Then other user's of the JGit API could make use of this code.

Sorry, I know I am late with this comment - and I was about to let commit this change and refactor it directly afterwards. But: officially copying code from EGit to JGit is because of the licenses not so easy.
So better put the code right now.
