DESCRIPTION:

Do not display "[NO-HEAD]" for empty repository

After a new repository has been created, its "master" branch is an
unborn branch. EGit showed "NO-HEAD" in the decorations for this case.

This is confusing for novices and looks like something went wrong. The
canonical implementation shows after "git init; git status": "On branch
master" and "Initial commit".

So let's display "master" in this case, too. Reserve the "NO-HEAD" for
cases where there is really no HEAD.

Also show such a HEAD in the repositories view under "References" and
decorate it as "[master] unborn; will be created by commit". Limit
showing such a HEAD to the repositories view: the content provider is
used in other places where such a HEAD node would only cause confusion
or malfunctioning. Use an extension factory to create the content
provider for the repositories view; in this way the new behavior can be
enabled there only without having to touch all the other places where
this content provider is used. Adapt the label provider to handle the
new case, and ensure that the history page doesn't get confused and
broken if HEAD is such an unborn branch.

In the staging view, display information similar to canonical git for
this case: "initial commit on empty branch". Note that the localizeable
text is appended to the normal title and includes any possible separator
characters. This enables correct typography for non-English languages;
for instance in French punctuation is preceded by a blank. (A blank at
the beginning of the value of the key-value pair in the properties file
would need to be escaped, though.)

Line:3788, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> just wondering if this repeated code can be extracted as Ref.isUnborn()...

Line:3788, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> I think you can have an unborn branch only if HEAD is a sym ref to a branch that doesn't exist yet. So I don't think it makes sense to have such an operation on Ref in general. Maybe Repository.isHeadUnborn() or Repository.isUnbornBranch()...

Line:1881, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> I think this could be misunderstood, there is no commit yet

maybe better something like:
* unborn branch: create an initial commit to start history
* no commit yet on unborn branch

instead of showing this in the title we could use warningLabel to show it above the commit message widget

Line:1881, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> Done. Since I believe this is more an information than a warning I've chosen to also show an info icon in this case.
