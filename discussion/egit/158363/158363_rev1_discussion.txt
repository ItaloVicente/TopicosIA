DESCRIPTION:

Use a job to run GitProjectData.reconfigureWindowCache();

Currently the EGit activator slows down the startup of the IDE, moving
GitProjectData.reconfigureWindowCache(); to a job seems to improve the
startup as reported by the OSGi startup logging.

To check for yourself, in your runtime configuration select the Trace
tab, enable it, select org.eclipse.osgi and select debug and
debug/BundleStartTime

Line:259, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> This would mean, all access to WindowCache started *before* the job runs will use *not* the settings from current workspace. In worst case this can lead to crashes on Linux / Windows, where mmap access could be configured differently as expected.

Thomas, I think you said this change would be safe?

I thought so... I had written "That could be safely done in the background **I think**." From https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=560412#c20 , emphasis added.

I'm not always right :-) Andrey may have a point here. And irrespective of that you'd have to ensure that this job is not left running after Activator.stop().
Line:265, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Also, strictly speaking it needs to be ensured that this job is not left running after Activator.stop().

Anyway: any such backgrounding things in the EGit Activator will not go into 5.7.0. Too close to release; it's too risky. Any such attempts should be done early in 5.8.0, i.e., after the 2020-03 Simrel.

We could trigger it at the beginning of the method and job before leaving start. This way thing could execute in parallel.
