DESCRIPTION:

Git Import Projects: always show directories

Currently, the import projects wizard only shows the working
directory tree if it is started from the clone wizard. The
working directory tree should also be shown when the wizard
is started from the Git Repositories view in order to improve
usability. If a subfolder of the working directory is selected
for starting this wizard, the selected folder should be marked
in the wizard's tree. The user can still change the selected
folder before hitting "Next".
