DESCRIPTION:

Make ProjectUtils publicly visible

Move the ProjectUtils (and it's required ProjectRecord) to a
non-internal package to enable third-party software to steer on their
own which projects should be imported and connected to GIT.

A real world example would be a plugin that manages it's own list of
"Categories", each containing a set of plugins to import. I have written
a wizard that lets the user chose a category, and it then imports all
associated plugins automatically.

Patch Set 2:

so would there be another way to easily do the same thing? if it's just a few lines i'd be ok with copy pasting this code. however i feel that this is a not-really-so-trivial thing to do... right?

i re-implemented all i need on my own side. of course this is some code duplication, and make it less future-save, but now i don't use internal things anymore.
