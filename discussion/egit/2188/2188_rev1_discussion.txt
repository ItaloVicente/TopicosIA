handle them right here.

Well, I *think* this may be a problem. The body of the message is the explanation.

It is not clear to me if we may work with a Document from
any thread in Eclipse. Perhaps a Docuement is far enough away from the UI. Let someone with insights into this comment.

I'm afraid I don't quite understand the problem here... Could you please elaborate some (perhaps even as a comment line in the code)?
