DESCRIPTION:

[repo view] Paste Repository URI Activation

It is confusing that the "paste" menu contribution is shown everywhere
but the corresponding clone repository action (for which it is a short
cut) is not.
After this change the paste command is active only when nothing or a
single repository group is selected.

@Thomas: Could you give me a brief feedback on the general issue (hide paste command in context menu/deactivate paste completely except for repo view root or single repository group selection).

> @Thomas: Could you give me a brief feedback

Personally I don't use that paste often. It's a very old feature I think. It's probably always enabled because when the view is set to follow the current selection in other editors or views, the selection very frequently will be a file in the working tree, not a repo or repo group. So sometimes the paste would work, and sometimes not. Having to figure out that this only works when a repo or repo group (or nothing at all) is selected is not obvious.

If the problem is the visibility of the command in the menu, its visibility could perhaps be restricted. But that would give us a situation where pasting would actually work but the command wasn't shown in the menu. Not sure that's any better.

If the problem is that a paste too often results in a "Cannot create git repo from clipboard content" dialog, then perhaps we could change the handling of this message. (Log only, or show in the status bar, or have a self-vanishing popup in the repo view, or something like that. Or perhaps just silently ignore.)

Thanks for the feedback. I'd have no real problem leaving everything as it is. I just felt that there is an inconsistency in the context menu entries. For me the paste is a short-cut for "clone repository and have the URI field already entered, so why do I see one but not the other? Well, for historical reasons.

I wanted to argue that it would not hurt to change the visibility, but indeed the paste is not part of the view menu where all the add/clone/create repository commands are present independent of the selection.
