there is some race condition in this change, when using reset or stash to remove uncommitted changes the checkout works correctly if I run this with breakpoints in the debugger, but it doesn't work if run without debugger, so the second checkout doesn't seem to work

Line:823, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> Obviously there's a race condition here. CleanupUncommittedChangesDialog creates, depending on the user's choice, a CommitJob, or a JobFamilies.RESET or JobFamilies.STASH job.

Which means after that dialog, we cannot do operations on the repo synchronously. They need to be in their own job so they get queued (if they all use an appropriate scheduling rule, which they should). Or in the worst case we'd have to join on COMMIT, RESET, and STASH, but I'd hate that.

Seems to me that this needs a larger refactoring of this FetchGerritChangePage. I always found that internalDoFetch(...) method above with all its boolean flags (some of which [or even all?] are mutually exclusive) and that "sequence" of steps highly confusing.

yes, it seems we need a larger refactoring to clean this up
