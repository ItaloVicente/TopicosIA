Looks generally fine to me. I was only wondering if there is a better package for the now shared components, but I have no good suggestion for that, either.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I missed this in first review: Please remove the dot from the commit message title. Only the second part of a commit message should be in sentence style, the first part should be in title style.

Generally nice, but I'm really missing the N/M feedback.

Slightly confusing: the search is over the full commit message, but there's no way to see that in the dialog. So sometimes one is left wondering why a certain commit is highlighted. (Already in the history view I sometimes wonder, but there I can see the commit message. Though it would help if matches in the text were highlighted, but that's totally unrelated.)
Line:38, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/SearchBar.java -> All this focus fiddling is probably not needed in the dialog, but it also doesn't seem to hurt. It _is_ needed unfortunately in the git history view toolbar.

Line:98, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/SearchBar.java -> Since bars==null in the dialog, there's no way to show the status. The feedback mechanism should be generalized such that we can show the N/M somewhere in the dialog.

That could probably go to a package org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.history.search. But then FindToolbar and related classes should go there, too. Let me know, what you think...

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ack

Line:98, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/SearchBar.java -> I hadn't noticed that message before. A solution would be to have a simple label on the dialog. Then I could update that from a custom IStatusLineManager implementation. So both GitHistoryPage and CommitSelectionDialog would pass an IStatusLineManager instance to their SearchBar. Downside of using IStatusLineManager is, that I need to create a class with about 30 methods, of which only 1 is really implemented, the rest would be emtpy stubs. Alternatively, I could create something similar to IStatusLineManager, specifically for this case. What do you think about that?

Line:38, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/SearchBar.java -> I think I'll remove the focus handling from SearchBar and create a separate class (extending SearchBar) that does all that inside GitHistoryPage.

Line:98, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/SearchBar.java -> Since you plan on creating a subclass anyway, how about this: (just a suggestion)

Make this class abstract. Remove this StatusListener class completely. Implement here instead a method

  abstract protected void showStatus(FindToolbar originator, String text);

In the subclass for the toolbar, override to do

  if (bars != null) {
    IStatusLineManager status = bars.getStatusLineManager();
    if (status != null) {
      status.setMessage(text);
    }
  }

In a second (perhaps even anonymous) subclass for the dialog override to show the text in a label.

In line 234 below, pass this::showStatus instead of statusListener.

Alternatively, pass in the StatusListener from outside in the constructor.

Thanks for your suggestion. Changed it accordingly. SearchBar is now an abstract class, that has concrete implementations in CommitSelectionDialog and GitHistoryPage. The whole workaround/focus-fiddling part went from SearchBar to GitHistoryPage's HistorySearchBar implementation. I think that's fits better.
