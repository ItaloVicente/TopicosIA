DESCRIPTION:

Relax constructor parameters of EGit operations

Certain EGit operations takes a Collection<IResource> as a
parameter in its constructor. The problem with this type is that
one cannot pass in a Collection<IFile> or a Collection<IFolder>.
Instead, you are forced to alter your existing collection into one
for IResources. The fix is to alter these constructors so that they
take a Collection<? extends IResource> instead.

Yes, that is annoying. I guess we couldn't make our minds up. For the time being this change is ok. 

This variant works well with the fact that clients construct collection and a collections make a smooth interface, while arrays seems to be more "eclipse"-style.

The other option is to just make them take IResource[] as the parameter. It doesn't really matter to me what happens but at the moment, there are constructors that takes collections and constructors that takes arrays. This inconsistency is very annoying.
