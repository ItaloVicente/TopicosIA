DESCRIPTION:

Decorate IFolders that are submodule working directory roots

Introduce a new configurable submodule text decoration used for folders
that are submodule working directory roots. The default is identical to
the project text decoration except that it doesn't contain the
repository name, as that is always the same as the folder name.

we could use the same decoration for nested repositories which are not submodules, currently nested repositories only show the branch name in their decoration

So, use the project decoration if it's a nested repo? So far all this submodule code didn't really care whether a folder contained a true submodule or a nested repo. Any idea how to cleanly and efficiently make the distinction? I see two ways:

1. (Hacky) Check the git directory path: if it contains "/.git/modules/", it's a submodule, otherwise a nested repo.
2. (Cleaner, but less efficient) Find a git repo starting from the parent of the IFolder. If any found, do a submodule walk and try to find the repo associated with the IFolder. If found, it's a submodule, otherwise a nested repo.

Do you see anything better?

And I just noticed that I somehow had completely overlooked your suggestion to use [<ref> <commitId>] <commit msg header>. Looks like that'll need a couple more "variables" for the format...
