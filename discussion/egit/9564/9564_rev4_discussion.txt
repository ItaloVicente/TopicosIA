Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please remove these from the commit message, a comment on the review is enough.

Also, please explain a bit more why this change is needed, the commit message is pretty short and kind of "huh?".

Line:139, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> A better name for this would be something like "preDeleteProjectListener".

Line:144, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> This should probably also check if the project was managed by EGit, something like:

  RepositoryProvider.getProvider(project) instanceof GitProvider

Or is it too late in PRE_DELETE?
