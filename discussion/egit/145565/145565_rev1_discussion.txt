DESCRIPTION:

Avoid duplicate entries in the history view's view history

With the history filtered to a resource, the view history of the
history view itself contained many duplicate elements. This was
caused by == comparisons instead of equals() in HistoryPageInput.

Also improve HistoryPageInput.hashCode() to use the "standard"
multiply-by-31 mechanism instead of xor.

Are you aware of the identity comparison in GitHistoryPage line 1825? Would this benefit from a similar change? That line is explicitly meant to filter away repeated similar inputs.

Is it? I thought it was meant to handle the case where getMostFittingInput() didn't change the input object. I think == is correct there.

What we could do in a follow-up change is to change HistoryPageInput.equals() to handle IResource and FileNode/FolderNode from the repo view as equal if they refer to the same repo-relative path in the same repo. The == on the repos is also a bit fragile; it works because we always use the same repo instance from the RepositoryCache, but maybe comparing repo.getDirectory() (with appropriate null checks if one of the repo fields is null) might be better.

I touched that line to avoid repeated history entries in 2e2810f7afd230a88ea5f3740401343814fd7e12, that's why I think it is related. Effectively we check the adapted new input against the current input (via super call). I believe you are right that this works okay with identity because we should really not have multiple Ref instances for the exact same branch or commit, independent of where the input is coming from, right?

You touched that line in that commit only to call super to get the original input. The line really checks that getMostFittingInput() didn't change anything. It's not about avoiding duplicates.
