DESCRIPTION:

Unify git history input naming

This changes how history page input is named in the upper left corner of
the history view.

* Remove the superfluous and hardcoded postfix "/" from folder names.
* Always map files/folders from working tree nodes to workspace
resources, if possible. That way labels are more simple (short workspace
paths instead of long file system paths), and it aligns the
functionality of "show in" versus "follow selection", which created
different history input from the same repository tree node until now.

This wasn't a comment about the commit message but what path the implementation shows. I think it would be better to always show the repo-relative path like the staging view does, since project-relative paths can be confusing and even ambiguous depending on where projects are located within the repository
