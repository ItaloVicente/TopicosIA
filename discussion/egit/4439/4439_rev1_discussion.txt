I prefer this compared to change: I10d08b503313f146969f38d5207fd1bdfaf97b92 as using the git formatter opens the way to add options to let the user choose other common timestamp formats supported by git. Showing standard git time format eats some horizontal space but also provides more information (timezone).

Same as Dani's change also this change doesn't give me the date and time format I specified in Mac OS X system preferences. I configured german date format and 24 hour time format but instead I get US date format and 12 hour time format. Maybe this is caused by an Eclipse platform bug ?

It seems Java doesn't care about the OS settings. It just uses the
locale (from OS unless overridden) and Java then has a a per-locale
database within Java.

I can't speak for Mac but on Windows it respects the regional settings in the sense that it respects the general formatting rules for the selected language/country. It however does not respect the detailed setting, e.g. the format chosen for short and long style. This is coming from the JRE as defined by DateFormat SHORT, MEDIUM and LONG.


The patch is better than nothing but still not what I would expect to see as a EGit user. See my comment in http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,4426.
