DESCRIPTION:

Bug 536645 - Staging view conflicting handlers org.eclipse.ui.edit.copy

The Staging view registers two actions for 'org.eclipse.ui.edit.copy'.
One with StagingView.createSelectionPathCopyAction() and one with
SpellcheckableMessageArea.configureContextMenu(). Each action is meant
for a specific control, with ActionUtils.setGlobalActions() using a
focus listener to enable/disable actions based on the active control.

This handling can result in errors when switching tabs in the part stack
that contains the Staging view. Namely, the SWT focus lost event can
come after the SWT activation event. Conflicting handlers are reported
during the SWT activation event; the focus lost event handling in
ActionUtils.setGlobalActions() does not deactivate handlers "on time".

This changes adds SWT activation/deactivation handlers on top of the
focus listeners, to ensure handler deactivation functions also in cases
as the above.

Line:231, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/ActionUtils.java -> I'll test next week if we can replace the focus listener with activation/deactivation listeners, as opposed to defining a second set of listeners.

Right now both seem to do work, I'm not sure why. But maybe activation/deactivation can cover also focus gain/lost.

Is this ready now? Last time I looked there was the idea of Simeon that maybe activate/deactivate could handle also the focus gained/lost. Also, I think the code gets simpler if this doesn't use the typed listener interface at all (FocusListener). Just have one low-level listener, registered via the low-level interface for all SWT event types needed, containing the "usual" switch on the event type.

I'll try to take a look this week, I wanted to know if the general direction of the change is on its own fine.

Yes, I think the basic idea of also catching activate/deactivate events is good.
