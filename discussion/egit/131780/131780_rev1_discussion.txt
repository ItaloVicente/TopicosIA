Patch Set 1:

I can't get this to work. Right now it seems there are even download problems.

Earlier today on my normal Photon workspace I managed to get everything downloaded and the target installed. The new sshd client compiles, and JUnit tests run. However, I was unable start a runtime Eclipse with EGit using the new JGit stuff. PDE complains about missing version constraints for net.i2p.eddsa and the bouncy castle optional imports.

It appears the bnd file in Orbit produces version constraints of the form (for instance for the net.i2p.eddsa packages) "[0.3.0,1)". PDE errors out on that, and then apparently misses the "resolution=optional". The versions should all be full three-component version: "[0.3.0,1.0.0)" (or "[1.59.0,2.0.0)" for BC). We should fix that in Orbit for the org.apache.sshd.core and or.apache.sshd.sftp bundles.

On a new workspace right now I'm unable to even get the target installed; I get the most crazy non-descript errors. I suspect it's a download problem.

My other Neon.3 setup on a different computer cannot download the target platform contents either.

fixed in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/131823/

I think we should file a bug for PDE for this, according to the OSGi spec 1 or 2 digit version numbers are also valid, see https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/7.0.0/framework.module.html#i2655136 and examples in https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/7.0.0/framework.module.html#i3189032

I'm still analyzing. I produced with orbit my own local repos with 3-digit version ranges, and it still errors out. Maybe because there is one "uses" clause in sshd-core where net.i2p.eddsa shows up. I'll keep investigating...
