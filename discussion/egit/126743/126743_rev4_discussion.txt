Yes, that's the work-around for now. Too bad; and sorry I didn't think of this sooner. PDE's API checks also don't warn about it...

The problem now is of course that existing users of the rename detector may have to handle the CancelledException explicitly without getting compiler help to notify them of the change...

So we'll have to clean this up when we tackle the "too many exceptions derived from IOException" issue.

not sure why PDE API checks don't spot this

I thought about adding new methods throwing CanceledException and deprecating the other ones, but since they would differ only in the set of thrown exceptions we would have to invent new method names which seems ugly

yes, I think this single incompatibility doesn't justify an immediate major version increase
