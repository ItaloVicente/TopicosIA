DESCRIPTION:

FetchGerritChangePage: don't auto-fill if user typed

The former mechanism trying to detect whether the user had typed
didn't really work; the completion did auto-fill all the same.

Instead track all modifications via a flag like it's already done
for other fields like the branchText. Additionally, make sure we
only start one background job per URI, and improve the pattern for
the content proposals such that we do get reasonable proposals also
when the user edits the input.

Line:678, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> what about this one? does the flag need to be set here, too?

Line:678, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> No. Here the paste replaces only a part of the text; I don't think auto-filling in that case is a good idea. In line 670, the complete text gets replaced; there it does make sense.

Your change has a side effect where I'm not sure you intended it. After the network traffic has finished for a valid gerrit URL, you normally have 1 proposal for a change number in the content assist. If you then modify the text "refs/changes/01/23456" anywhere, that one proposal vanishes, since the text is considered invalid.

With your change, you can edit the text basically everywhere, and we still get some (often unrelated) change numbers proposed. E.g. change "refs" to "fefs" in the text field and hit Ctrl-Space. There is a long list of change numbers proposed.

I thought it was a feature. But if you prefer I can change it such that the list stays only if the text is a prefix of /refs/changes (and not empty, and not a single /), or is only digits, or "/refs/changes" is a prefix of the text.

Please test it for yourself. Take the URL of this change, and after the network stuff is done, change the "refs" to "whatever" in the text. Hit Ctrl-Space and you get hundreds of suggested changes and versions, that _are completely unrelated_ to the change number in the text field. I understand that you added some less restrictive patterns in the pattern matching, but I expected that even with those new patterns the suggestions would have some correlation to the current input.
