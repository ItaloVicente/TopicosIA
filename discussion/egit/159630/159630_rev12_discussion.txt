DESCRIPTION:

WIP investigate TagActionTest Failure

The purpose of this change is to investigate the TagActionTest failures
of change 138436. Currently, I cannot see the modified tag sort order
influencing the tests and locally (in Eclipse) all the tests pass.
By removing most of the other tests and adding asserts/logging, I want
to reduce build time and find out, what makes the tests fail.

Tags are added in an asynch UI thread. Also the sort order seems to be
different locally and on Jenkins (or not all tags are shown). So we try
to make the tag selection
sort order independent... I am running out of ideas here.

The actual relevant changes here are in TagActionTest. All other changes were made to shorten the build time.

My finding is that possibly due to populating the tag tree in a asynchronous UI thread, the tree is not always fully populated when the swt bot is to make the tree item selection.
