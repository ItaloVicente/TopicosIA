DESCRIPTION:

WIP investigate TagActionTest Failure

The purpose of this change is to investigate the TagActionTest failures
of change 138436. Currently, I cannot see the modified tag sort order
influencing the tests and locally (in Eclipse) all the tests pass.
By removing most of the other tests and adding asserts/logging, I want
to reduce build time and find out, what makes the tests fail.

Tags are added in an asynch UI thread. Also the sort order seems to be
different locally and on Jenkins. So we try to make the tag selection
sort order independent... I am running out of ideas here.

All the screenshots in https://ci.eclipse.org/egit/job/egit.gerrit/1360/#showFailuresLink show a tag we did not want to select. Even if the code supposedly clears any prior selection and text and selects the tree item only if the label fits. Locally, the tests pass (Eclipse, Windows 10). The failing asserts seem to indicate that the screenshots are actually made when the test failed... But where are the other tags? Maybe, the lazy loading of the tags for the dialog plays a role...
