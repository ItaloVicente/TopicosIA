DESCRIPTION:

Support state [removed, untracked] in commit dialog

Files which are removed from the index but exist in the working
directory were displayed as "removed" in the commit dialog.
Committing such a change removed the affected files from the
repository. Now such files are displayed as "removed, untracked"
and on commit they are tracked as modification of the affected files.
