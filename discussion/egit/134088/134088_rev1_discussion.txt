DESCRIPTION:

[discussion] require minimum versions of core bundles

Due to the recent question whether or not we can use a Mars-only API of
StructuredSelection I remembered that Xtext now not only requires
minimum versions of features (for P2 installation), but also minimum
versions of bundles. That avoids runtime errors where users somehow
managed to use the bundles in a too old environment.

I suggest that we also increase the minimum required version for some
"core" bundles. This change exemplary does that for
* core.runtime
* jface, jface.*

The versions are taken from the resolved egit-4.5 target platform. If
this seems reasonable to other developers, I would continue with some
more core bundles.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Sounds good to me. I suppose they were just never updated to match our minimum version out of laziness.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> But that is not good. For instance you got jface 3.11.1. But Mars.0 had 3.11.0.

Trouble is, if we use the version numbers from X.0, but only test/develop with X.2 in the target platform, then we still have some untested range.

I can understand that some users cannot upgrade between major versions due to restrictions on other plugins they require. However, I would want users to always upgrade to the latest service release available for their major version. If they don't even manage that (and sit on the lowest major version we support), I'm okay with not supporting them.

If we want to officially support all the X.0 releases, then we should rewrite our TPD files, since they fetch the latest bundles.

I should probably move this discussion to a bug, to enable everyone to expression his/her opinion about the support level.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes, this is caused by laziness and I agree we should fix this. Please fix it in a single commit if possible.

I would assume that all platform bundles follow semantic versioning and that they don't do breaking changes in service releases, hence I don't see a reason why we should insist on 4.5.2 instead of 4.5.0 as the baseline for the lowest version we accept.
I also would assume that anybody who wants a platform fix for 4.5 is probably the one who has to implement the fix.

Maintenance statement for EGit [1] says that we support at least the last two platform releases and try to avoid breaking older releases if there is no good reason to do so. This means we do not promise to test releases older than the last 2 platform releases.
