Apparently the code is already present, we just didn't link it into the UI?  I'd like it if the commit message explained what was really going on here, like "this action was created in commit X but wasn't enabled in the UI".

This change partly replaces

http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,112.

Please have a look for the comments there.

I also first thought we should bring up a dialog when the user selects "Compare with Revision".

But together with http://egit.eclipse.org/r/122 (Compare with the working tree on double click) the behaviour would be the same as in CVS. We should however also call the action then "Compare with History..." as CVS does. Then the user would not be astonished that no dialog comes up.

We should also add "Compare" actions in the History View. I already did that in my repo but wanted to wait until this change and http://egit.eclipse.org/r/122 are thoroughly discussed.

Good point, I admit that I'm not that familiar with CVS. I also see the advantage with this solution that we do not need to duplicate the list of revisions in a new dialog.

However, I suggest that we also use the same label then as CVS: Compare With -> History.

I replaced it in 1b66794e691d9614ef0005e9fdece89b915a8546, but the remained. Then Shawn removed the replacement in 92a1cc82904b37476abb47d6462b40b0ce375e9b.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I'm not sure what this does, or is supposed to do. This git history page flashes and the selected revision changes, but nothing visible happens. 

Looking at the code makes me scratch my head. Seems the class is some legacy from the time when I did not know much at all about Eclipse...

I think we should bring up a compare dialog. The old history page actually had some logic like that as an indirect action, but the current version doesn't.

Ah, some light...

As I see it this action should open the history view so the user can then compare a selected revision with the local version, which we cannot yet do. This this action promises
too much. This original view had this, though it only worked well on Linux for some mysterious reason.

It should also be named just "Git Revision..." (or possibly "Revision..." to avoid the strange looking 

"Compare with... Compare with Revision" menu.

This behaves like "Compare with->History..." in the CVS module. So I think the user would expect to see a view with the revisions of the file. I do not know GIT terminology that well because of my CVS background. Maybe we should rename the menu entry to make it clearer.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:112, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> What's going on here, bad indentation on this element?  Can we avoid changing it while adding new functionality?  I'd prefer to have pure whitespace fix patches be isolated.

Line:121, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Should be translated through a property.

Also, shouldn't we have a tooltip?
