DESCRIPTION:

GitInfo API: access to commit ID and index state

Extend the GitInfo API to also provide information about where the
underlying git item is: in the working tree, in the index, or in a
commit. Add a getCommitId() method returning null, ObjectId.zeroId(),
or the commit id, respectively.

Further extend the GitInfo API to provide information about the git
state of an item. Move the IResourceState interface from EGit UI to
EGit core, make it public and rename it to GitItemState. Add a method
GitInfo.getGitState() to get an instance. This gives third-party
bundles a stable API for safe and efficient access to EGit's
IndexDiffData. Otherwise clients would have to read and traverse the
whole DirCache from the repository to determine such info themselves.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> @Matthias: before you dive too deeply into the JGit apply series (thanks a lot for taking a look there!), could you maybe give some feedback on this particular point? Returning the zero ID for items in the index makes for a simple to use API and was the first idea I had, but I'm not completely comfortable with it. Yet I don't see a cleaner alternative that would be equally easy to use... Would such an API be OK with you? API interface is at [1].

I'd like to get this API merged in EGit before M3 so that the diffmerge people have at least some time before the release to update & re-test their code.

(See bug 572802 for where this whole API idea is coming from.)

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> The differentiation between returning null for an item in the working tree and zeroId for an item in the index seems a bit weird. Returning null in both these cases would look more natural, since there is no commit (yet) in both cases.
Couldn't this difference be deduced from GitItemState ?

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not sure. At any time one can for the same git path have all three. I'm not sure the user would always know what had been adapted (if it was an IResource, he should know the underlying item is from the working tree, and if he adapted something else, getCommitId() returning null would be sufficient to distinguish an index item from a commit item).

So here's an alternative proposal: let's add

  enum Source {
    WORKING_TREE, INDEX, COMMIT
  }

  /**
   * Returns the {@link Source} of the item this {@link GitInfo}
   * object was obtained from.
   * <p>
   * {@link GitInfo} objects can be obtained via adaptation from a
   * variety of objects. If the adapted object was an IResource,
   * then it's a file in the git {@link Source#WORKING_TREE}, but
   * the {@link GitInfo} might also have been obtained from a file
   * version in the {@link Source#INDEX}, or even from a file
   * revision in a {@link Source#COMMIT}.
   * </p>
   *
   * @return the {@link Source} of this {@link GitInfo} object
   */
  public Source getSource();

and then state on getCommitId() that it returns null if the source is not Source.COMMIT.

Knowing where an item "lives" may be important especially for such uses as in diffmerge. Without this knowledge made explicit somehow, third-party bundles will have to figure it themselves and again are likely to access internals like IndexFileRevision or some such.
