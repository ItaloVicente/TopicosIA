DESCRIPTION:

Move unnecessary jobs to DS components

This move the AutoShareProjects setup to a DS component, which gets kicked off
by the existence of the IWorkspace and IJobManager services when available. As
a result, we don't block the main thread from starting up, and can dismiss the
splash screen quicker.

THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - DO NOT MERGE

This is a WIP, so shouldn't be merged as-is.

However, we can shave off another 30ms with this change, and I think there are more opportunities to move to other background jobs as well. We might be able to use @Component annotations but I'd need to check that this worked with the existing build infra and not just PDE before doing that.

I'll do some more work on this change and see if we can pull it out of the list.

I like this approach
