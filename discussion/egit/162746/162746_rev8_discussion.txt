DESCRIPTION:

Staging View: Allow "Push HEAD" when there is nothing to commit

The "Commit and Push" button becomes "Push HEAD" in case there is
no change to be committed. This makes the most common push operation
directly accessible in the staging view and saves a few clicks in
some cases as the user doesn't have to switch to some other view.

If the repository has no HEAD (unborn branch) do not offer "Push
HEAD" but only "Commit and Push".

Other minor UI changes: don't require the buttons to be the same size
to avoid "jumping" buttons when the text on the "Commit and Push" or
"Push HEAD" button changes, and use the PushWizardDialog also for the
"Push To Gerrit..." wizard (so that the the "Finish" button is labeled
"Push"). Remove setHelpAvailable(true) calls on the dialog since there
is no help available. No point showing the help icon if it doesn't do
anything.

Just gave a quick look, but I like introduction of PushMode.getWizard().

If you can spare the time I'd appreciate your feedback on the choice of Gerrit wizard/Push branch wizard. For a Gerrit repo, it's still tied to the state of the "Change-ID" button. Which is of course an approximation only. First, Gerrit might be configured to allow pushing patch sets without change id, and second, someone might want to push a commit with change id directly.

We could also add a link in the Gerrit push wizard to open the Push branch wizard (like in the push branch wizard to get to the full general push wizard).

As mentioned earlier, I'd personally be fine with no Gerrit wizard at all ;) But the approximation you implemented seems sane and is IMO good enough for a merge soon. IMO, it's worth pushing the change as it, let people play with it from snapshots and see whether it seems good enough for most people or whether it's something we should change in some future commit.

That would be nice. Would you like me to open a Bugzilla issue about it?
