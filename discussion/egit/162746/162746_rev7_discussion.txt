DESCRIPTION:

Staging View: Allow "Push HEAD" when there is nothing to commit

The "Commit and Push" button becomes "Push HEAD" in case there is
no change to be committed.
That allows to save a few clicks in some cases (like pushing same commit
multiple time, or when doing a local commit, then some test, then
pushing,
without having to switch to some other view)

Very cool, especially in combination with https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/162769/ . But Matthias is right: I have a repo with

  [remote "origin"]
    ...
    push = HEAD: refs/for/master

and a branch

  [branch "bar"]
    remote = origin
    merge = refs/heads/master
    rebase = true

where "Push HEAD..." gives me the "push branch" dialog irrespective of whether change-id is checked or not. (When it is checked, the button does have the "Gerrit repo" icon.)

It would be more consistent if it gave me the "Push to Gerrit" dialog since the config is set up that way. Perhaps the dialog logic from the CommitJob could be factored out and re-used in staging view directly?

what if you have more remotes and want to push to another one than Gerrit?
The issue with the Gerrit wizard is that it doesn't allow to push to some non-Gerrit remote, and it can be annoying, while the generic Push Branch wizard can push to anything, including Gerrit.

I think before forcing for usage of the Gerrit push wizard, we should ensure there is a simple way to move from the Gerrit push to the regular push branch wizard.
Note that the wizard is always shown in case of Push HEAD..., so the remote is used to prepopulate the wizard, and using the Push Branch wizard wouldn't require any additional click or keystroke for the case you mention. So I'm even not convinced the Gerrit wizard is better in this case.

FWIW, I don't plan to work more on this issue soon. So anyone interested can merge and fix, or amend directly this commit in the meantime to provide such extra behavior.
