General remark: I find the code of the run method hard to follow, in particular the purpose of the "if (commitToLoad != null) {"-part (lines 92ff) within the for-loop. It looks like it will run only in the first iteration if ever (commitToLoad is set to null).
If it is about making the operation cancellable, I still don't see the point because neither loadedCommits.fillTo(commitToLoad, maxCommits) (line 93) nor the loop for checking for the commit id (line 98) check the monitor. Only the cancellable batch loading (line 105) requires the loop!?
Line:137, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GenerateHistoryJob.java -> If I understand correctly, the essential change is to force an update if the new list is empty and this guard covers the update call which is not done anymore by the original else branch (due to the added not-empty condition).

I wonder if there is a case where the initial size equals the new size but the commits are different, so that no update is called although it should.

Maybe the code becomes easier to read, if a boolean doUiUpdate is introduced and set to true in the appropriate places. This would allow a simple
if(doUiUpdate){updateUI(incomplete;}
just before the finally without having to worry about the "missing" else-branches.

Line:158, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GenerateHistoryJob.java -> Did you intentionally only fix this "missing braces" location (as there are many more)? If you wanted to only make functionally relevant changes, this would (and fix missing braces along the way), this change is not necessary.

> General remark: I find the code of the run method hard to follow,

So do I :-) It's ugly as hell. Basically, it tries to support incrementally loading a history, but as you pointed out, it has a number of flaws (such as finding a wanted commit only if it's in the first batch).

But this thing and the interactions with the GitHistoryPage is fragile as hell. Revamping this would be a lot of work; I wouldn't want to do that just to fix this bug.
Line:137, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GenerateHistoryJob.java -> The problem was two-fold: it failed on an uncheck (typically on uncheck of refs/remotes/**) because that meant nothing was checked. So we ended up here, but commitNotFound was true because the job was looking for HEAD. Adding the !isEmpty() makes the job update the UI in that case via the else branch.

With that in place, it then failed on the check refs/tags/**. This time, there _are_ commits, but again not HEAD, so it entered this branch again. That's when I added the initialSize comparison.

Line:158, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GenerateHistoryJob.java -> That's a remnant of my having had a System.err.println here while tracking this down. Noticed after the commit that the braces were still in, but I don't think it's worth removing it.

I did not want you to do that. I really only wanted to say, I do not see at first glance what's happening.

Basically, I am fine with the change. My worry is that a fairly big problem is taken care of, leaving a tiny one, which may be even harder to track if it hits.
Line:137, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GenerateHistoryJob.java -> I don't insist on extracting the updateUI-call into a separate "if" (although I'd find it more readable, in particular if the conditions when to do it are not complete, yet). Also, the if seems to deal with two different issues at once - ui update and show warning. The original nested if looks suspicious anyway - isn't the intention really "show warning or do an UI-update"; possibly not, if you want to prevent unnecessary updates...

But I want to ask again. Can you think of a szenario where 5 commits are shown originally and due to a filter change (possibly switch from one complicated ref-filter definition to another) 5 other commits are loaded? Or rather can you guarantee that there is no such scenario?

Line:158, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GenerateHistoryJob.java -> Fine with me.

This cannot happen. The GitHistoryPage creates a new GenerateHistoryHob in that case. So the if is just to avoid a UI update if we didn't load any new commits.
