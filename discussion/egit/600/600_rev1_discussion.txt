Some methods in the Activator were
moved to the appropriate classes that
need them or dropped altogether
as they were not used anywhere.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:240, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/CommitGraphTable.java -> Should we instead put this into a utility class?  The method is used twice, which is probably why we put it into the Activator in the first place... to avoid duplicating it.
