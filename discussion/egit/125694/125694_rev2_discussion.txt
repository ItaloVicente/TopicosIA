Line:192, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/GitProjectData.java -> setSystem(true), too?

Line:192, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/GitProjectData.java -> I'm not entirely sure about the "perfect policy" myself. setUser(false) should be called for everything not triggered by the user, setSystem(true) for everything the user should not even see.

This job can take quite some time during workbench startup and I think it is nice to see why it is sometimes sluggish during that time. Also the user can actually understand what this job does (in contrast to the tip of the day framework deferring its loading, where I recently set system=true because of the user not really understanding that job's label).

Does that sound reasonable to you? Otherwise I'm also fine with adding system=true.

Line:192, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/project/GitProjectData.java -> Probably doesn't matter here, since the only listener we have here is the GitLightWeightDecorator. However, non-system jobs using scheduling rules may interrupt the auto build job. Compare bug 459525; relevant code appears to be AutoBuildJob.isInterrupted() (the isBlocking() call).

I'm a bit puzzled by your statement that this job might be slow on workbench start. Perhaps we should analyze this and check if those events are needed on workbench start, or whether we might suppress them in some cases, or whether we can do without altogether and somehow refresh the decorator explicitly otherwise. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/68494/ and bug 489696 for why the decorator listens on that event. Since it's the only listener for that event we might really have a chance to completely get rid of it and of this job.
