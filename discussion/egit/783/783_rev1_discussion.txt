DESCRIPTION:

Improve Repositories View performance

RepositoriesView now uses the shared Repository instances provided by
RepositoryCache instead of creating own instances.
This enables RepositoriesView to listen to repository change events.
The auto refresh job of RepositoriesView is no longer needed.
Activator.RCS was enhanced to scan all repositories contained in
RepositoryCache. This was required because RepositoriesView is the first
client of RepositoryCache that uses Repository instances which might
not have a project in the workspace.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Looks good. In the future, we may want to consider not overloading our Activator with services. We are mixing a lot of concerns currently in our Activator.

Patch Set 1:

1. the RCS must be changed to also scan repositories for which there are no projects

+1

2. the repository change listeners should be unregistered during the dispose() method of the view

+1

3. instead of letting the view itself implement the listener interface one could do this with a final member of the view (an anonymous implementation): avoids pollution of the viewer class

+1

We should work on an updated patch.

Uhm... Obviously I'm a bit late here... Anyway, my comments on this:

0. Great idea!

2. the repository change listeners should be unregistered during the dispose() method of the view

RCS was already extended in this patch. It scans all repos.
I'll provide an additional patch for the two remaining issues.
