DESCRIPTION:

Fix NPEs being thrown on tree selection in the reset dialog

New code was introduced to enable/disable buttons based on the
selection in the tree. However, this code did not compensate
for the fact that some of those buttons may not have been
instantiated if the dialog is being used for a reset operation.
