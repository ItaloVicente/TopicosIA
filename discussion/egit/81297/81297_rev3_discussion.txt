DESCRIPTION:

Handle rebase modes 'preserve' and 'interactive' in EGit

EGit and JGit treated branch.<name>.rebase as a boolean config value,
which is wrong: git actually also allows 'preserve' and 'interactive'.

Since commit aadbb158 in JGit, JGit does recognize these extra values.

Adapt the EGit UI (wizards & dialogs for branch creation, branch
configuration, pulling and pushing a branch) to provide a UI to let
the user select any valid BranchRebaseMode value. Introduce a new
BranchRebaseModeCombo for this.

Adapt UI tests.

Honor the setting in all relevant operations in EGit.

Note that JGit currently ignores the "interactive" setting in a
PullCommand and performs a normal rebase instead.

Patch Set 3:

When using command "Pull..." on a local branch which has no upstream configuration yet the Pull wizard pre-fills the field "Reference" with the name of the currently checked out local branch, if there is no upstream branch with that name the pull command fails with the following error:

"Remote origin did not advertise Ref for branch refs/heads/b. This Ref may not exist in the remote or may be hidden by permission settings."

I think it would be better if the Pull wizard would check if the reference matching the current local branch exists upstream, and if it doesn't exist it should not pre-fill the field "Reference" to avoid the above error.

Actually, I think when Mikael introduced this PullWizard he started with a copy of the PushWizard. When pushing, it makes sense to propose the local branch name if it has no upstream config yet. For pulling, it doesn't make sense at all. I suggest the wizard should just leave the field empty in that case. There is content assist on the field, which will then go fetch the advertised refs from the server. Doing that automatically takes too long. (Oh, and the tooltip on the content assist light bulb is wrong. It doesn't show "previously used values", it proposes actually advertised refs.)

But in any case I think this should be done in a separate change. It's unrelated to supporting rebase modes 'preserve' and 'interactive'.
