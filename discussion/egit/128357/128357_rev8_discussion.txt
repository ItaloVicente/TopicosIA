DESCRIPTION:

Adds repository selection combo to the fetch gerrit change dialog

Removes the message that no repository is selected if the fetch gerrit
change dialog is called without a repository selected (e.g. via ctrl +
3).
Instead there is a combo selector on top of the dialog that lets the
user choose what repository he wants (even if a repository is selected).

If an editor is open with a file, we also grab the active file and use
its repository instead (only if no repository is selected).

Thank you very much for the feedback.

I'll still need some help on how to handle some cases:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/128357/8/org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java#265
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/128357/8/org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commands/shared/FetchChangeFromGerritCommand.java#62

Do you maybe have any suggestions on how to handle these cases?

Sorry, I don't understand this change at all. What problem is this trying to solve?

The original request in bug 507733 was to be able to choose a repository if none was selected. Period. That does not require any fancy active editor stuff (which may be on a file not in any git repo anyway). And FetchChangeFromGerritCommand doesn't even open this wizard if it cannot detect a repo.

To satisfy the request in bug 507733, all that's needed is in FetchChangeFromGerritCommand, if repository == null, to show a simple dialog where the user can select one of the repositories shown in the repositories view. Once the user has chosen one, open the FetchFromGerritWizard with that repo. If the user canceled, quit. So basically replace the MessageDialog in FetchChangeFromGerritCommand with a new and better dialog.
Line:63, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commands/shared/FetchChangeFromGerritCommand.java -> Why can't it? What if the active editor is for a file that is not in any git repository?

Line:240, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> Previously, if the clipboard contained a git fetch command as provided by Gerrit (top right, "Download", on a change page), the dialog would pre-select that URI. I think by removing this defaultUri this functionality is no longer available. (Didn't try the change yet, though.)

Line:492, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> How does this perform? This runs though all configs of all repositories. I typically have some 20+ repositories in my git repo view. I'm not convinced this is a good idea.

I think that if no repository is selected the active editor is a reasonable choice to guess the repository to take as default. This assumes that I tend to look at files which are related to the change I plan to pull in.

One can maybe look at the active editor to try to determine a preselection for the repository selection dialog that would be used instead of the plain message dialog.  Such an approach would also have the benefit that it would be much easier to implement.

The current combo approach breaks some existing functionality and, because it always goes over all configured repos, is bound to give poor performance. I don't like it.

A repo selection on the FetchGerritChangePage makes no sense. If you've already entered a change ref, it's highly unlikely that it will make sense if you then change the repo. Let's stick with a simple workflow: first choose a repo (if there's none that can be determined from the event), then open the fetch wizard. FetchGerritChangeWizard and FetchGerritChangePage would remain completely unchanged with that approach.

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=507733#c4 suggested that approach, that is why we went this route.

Hadn't seen that. Unfortunately I disagree with Michael here. But if the other committers can shepherd this approach into something useable, I won't oppose. Hence only -1.
