DESCRIPTION:

GPG signing: use an external GPG executable

Don't rely on JGit's GPG signer based on BouncyCastle. BouncyCastle
in Eclipse is crippled; it lacks the patent-encumbered AES/OCB cipher
that is needed to decrypt encrypted private keys stored by GPG in the
Extended Key Format. Also, the JGit BouncyCastle GpgSigner has to rely
on a number of assumptions about GPG internals. Compare bug 570501.

Instead use a GpgSigner implementation that uses an external GPG
executable for signing. That way it is guaranteed that signing works
if it works in command-line git. Delegate all passphrase handling to
the external GPG. This gives automatic integration with the native
keychain and with gpg-agent.

Add a new EGit preference at Git->Committing where the user can specify
the path to a GPG executable. EGit finds the GPG to use

* via the EGit preference, if set, otherwise
* via the git config gpg.program, if set, otherwise
* by looking on $PATH for an executable named "gpg" (or "gpg.exe").

If the EGit preference is an invalid path or not an executable file,
errors are logged and the EGit preference is ignored. Normally, it
should not be necessary to set the Eclipse preference, but it helps
avoid the lookup on $PATH, and it may help if for some reason the
value specified in the git config should not work with EGit.

Verifying signatures still uses the JGit verifier, which is also based
on BouncyCastle. Verifying doesn't need AES/OCB, and needs only a
public key, which JGit can find without access to GPG internals.

Automated tests for this are not possible on the current build
infrastructure as it would need a GPG installation and keys. The
change has been tested manually on

* OS X 10.14.6 with gpg 2.2.25
* CentOS 7 with gpg 2.0.22
* Win 10 with gpg 2.2.27 (gpg4win 3.1.15)

> when I first create a signed tag using git which asks me for my passphrase creating I signed tag in EGit also works, I guess since gpg caches the passphrase I entered for a while

Well... no, it doesn't. But gpg-agent does. gpg 2 always uses the gpg-agent, and starts it if not running.

How exactly did you get asked for a passphrase when using command-line git? Command-line prompt or with a dialog box? (I always get a dialog box. Even when I kill the gpg-agent, remove the pinentry-program line from my gpg-agent.conf, and try again. Even if remove my gpg-agent.conf file completely and kill all and any gpg-agent processes on the system.) The dialog box comes from the pinentry-mac program which is used by gpg-agent to get passphrases.

> my user.signingkey has 16 digits and I get the checkbox for creating signed tag, also works with full key with 40 digits

Yes, 8, 16, or 40 hex characters/digits works. I had (by mistake) 20 in my test setup, and it suddenly didn't find the key anymore.

you are right, after signing a commit or tag there is a gpg-agent process:

 $ ps -aef | grep gpg
  503 89068     1   0  2:39PM ??         0:00.01 gpg-agent --homedir /Users/XXXXXX/.gnupg --use-standard-socket --daemon

gpg shows a text prompt in the terminal not a separate dialog window

So where did this gpg come from? Any GPG that I installed on my mac (not that many, admittedly) came with and used pinentry-mac. With a pinentry that expects input from the user via the terminal (or stdin) this won't work. We have no way to parse possibly localized prompts from GPG in any reasonable way. We have no way to force the gpg-agent to use a UI dialog prompt.

I have an older GPG2 installation (I think it came via EnigMail, or I installed it when I first used EnigMail) that lives at /usr/local/MacGPG2. I have a newer one living at /usr/local/gnupg-2.2; the links in /usr/local/bin point to this one. Both have and use pinentry-mac (for instance at /usr/local/gnupg-2.2/bin/pinentry-mac.app/Contents/MacOS/pinentry-mac). $PATH in bash includes /usr/local/bin, so gpg on the command-line executes /usr/local/gnupg-2.2/bin/gpg.

So why does your gpg ask on the terminal?

$ ls -al /usr/local/bin/gpg
lrwxr-xr-x 1 XXXXXX admin 30 Feb 11 01:48 /usr/local/bin/gpg -> ../Cellar/gnupg/2.2.27/bin/gpg

apparently I installed gpg using homebrew

I now explicitly installed and configured pinentry-mac and now I get its dialog.
When I remove the passphrase it stored in keychain and restart gpg-agent then also EGit shows the dialog from pinentry-mac :-)

Found and removed this in my ~/.bash_profile which seems to configure passphrase prompt in the terminal

 GPG_TTY=$(tty)
 export GPG_TTY

The new tracing might perhaps help. Mine shows for instance in the stderr:

I suppose you have pinentry-tty or pinentry-curses installed, and somehow it's being used. I don't know what GPG reports then, but I'd guess it'd be a PINENTRY_LAUNCHED line with "tty" or "curses".
If there s a way to make your normal gpg prompt via a dialog box by setting or unsetting environment variables, we could include that. I already unset PINENTRY_USER_DATA for precisely this reason; maybe unsetting GPG_TTY could also help.

I used the official installers from https://gnupg.org/download/index.html#sec-1-2 .

If you unset GPG_TTY you get the dialog prompt? That'd be perfect; we can do that in our code, too.

If I set GPG_TTY and then run gpg on the command-line, it reports

  PINENTRY_LAUNCHED 22712 mac 1.1.0 /dev/ttys000 xterm-256color /private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.jobL5VbdW6/org.macosforge.xquartz:0

and still shows the dialog. Fields 5 and 6 seem to relate to this tty setting. Field 7 is $DISPLAY. Interestingly the --no-tty option that is passed does not suppress this tty info, and pinentry-mac shows the dialog even if unset $DISPLAY!

I sent you the trace via private email

unsetting GPG_TTY alone is not sufficient, in addition I had to kill the existing gpg-agent process then it works and I get the passphrase dialog or, if I checked the checkbox "Save in keychain", signing works transparently without showing a prompt.

At least we could detect that gpg-agent use pinentry-curses or pinentry-tty. But that still doesn't really help if a user has a gpg-agent that is started in way that it always uses that. Yeah, unsetting GPG_TTY won't help of course if gpg-agent is running already. Confused myself momentarily there.

The only way (I know of) to make gpg-agent choose per request is a custom script as pinentry program that chooses the real pinentry program based on the value of the PINENTRY_USER_DATA environment variable, which is passed through from gpg to gpg-agent to the pinentry. Such a setup is way too complicated for most users.

And if pinentry-curses fails already with "inappropriate ioctl", even attempting to parse stdout and feed a passphrase via stdin won't work.

we could show instructions to the user if we detect current setup doesn't work
- unset GPG_TTY if set
- check if gpg-agent runs, if yes kill it
- install pinentry
- configure gpg-agent.conf

I wouldn't care which implementation is used to prompt for the passphrase, hence I don't have a need to choose per request
