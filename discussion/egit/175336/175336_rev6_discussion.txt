DESCRIPTION:

GPG signing: use an external GPG executable

Don't rely on JGit's GPG signer based on BouncyCastle. BouncyCastle
in Eclipse is crippled; it lacks the patent-encumbered AES/OCB cipher
that is needed to decrypt encrypted private keys stored by GPG in the
Extended Key Format. Also, the JGit BouncyCastle GpgSigner has to rely
on a number of assumptions about GPG internals. Compare bug 570501.

Instead use a GpgSigner implementation that uses an external GPG
executable for signing. That way it is guaranteed that signing works
if it works in command-line git. Delegate all passphrase handling to
the external GPG. This gives automatic integration with the native
keychain and with gpg-agent.

Add a new EGit preference at Git->Committing where the user can specify
the path to a GPG executable. EGit finds the GPG to use

* via the EGit preference, if set, otherwise
* via the git config gpg.program, if set, otherwise
* by looking on $PATH for an executable named "gpg" (or "gpg.exe").

If the EGit preference is an invalid path or not an executable file,
errors are logged and the EGit preference is ignored. Normally, it
should not be necessary to set the Eclipse preference, but it helps
avoid the lookup on $PATH, and it may help if for some reason the
value specified in the git config should not work with EGit.

Verifying signatures still uses the JGit verifier, which is also based
on BouncyCastle. Verifying doesn't need AES/OCB, and needs only a
public key, which JGit can find without access to GPG internals.

Automated tests for this are not possible on the current build
infrastructure as it would need a GPG installation and keys. The
change has been tested manually on

* OS X 10.14.6 with gpg 2.2.25
* CentOS 7 with gpg 2.0.22
* Win 10 with gpg 2.2.27 (gpg4win 3.1.15)

Cannot reproduce. What I did discover though is that if one uses hex key IDs (or fingerprints), gpg --locate-keys (or also gpg --list-keys) works only if the hex string is exactly 4, 8, or 20 bytes. Just specifying in user.signingKey an arbitrary suffix of the full fingerprint doesn't work, but then you don't even get the checkbox for a signed tag in the "create tag" dialog. That could be improved perhaps to at least show a warning if user.signingkey is set.

What gpg version do you use? What's pinentry-program in your ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf?

We might also need to add more debug tracing to be able to diagnose such problems. New debug option in .options, might dump the command called and the stderr output of the command.

when I first create a signed tag using git which asks me for my passphrase creating I signed tag in EGit also works, I guess since gpg caches the passphrase I entered for a while

another UI issue on Big Sur, after resizing the dialog I see the text which I typed in.
Looks like the first line of the text box isn't shown when the dialog opens, increasing its size
reveals the text I typed

my user.signingkey has 16 digits and I get the checkbox for creating signed tag, also works with full key with 40 digits
