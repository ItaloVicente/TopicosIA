Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed


Line:407, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/Activator.java -> Absolutely nothing.

We should toss both and just use handleError() for now.

I left both in as they were called by other folks. Essentially it's a further cleanup thing that we need to do.
