DESCRIPTION:

ConfigureGerritAfterCloneTask - relax reply matching

Gerrit nightly/snapshot builds will contain only the source revision in
the gerrit version reply - this should still be discovered.

The current implementation is paranoid regarding others returning a
"gerrit version" string which is wrong. I think even IF such a GIT
server implementation would exist, the impact of falsely detecting
Gerrit is less severe than not detecting a Gerrit.

Actually not so sure anymore. I found the "why" the version was not in our builds. The reason was that we have our own gerrit repository we're building from, and we did not push the release tags there.

Gerrit build uses 'git describe --always --match "v[0-9].*" --dirty' to calculate the release number.

Ah. I wondered why you wanted to do this. True, the version number is only defined for official Gerrit releases, not for custom builds...

except for when you push all the official tags along with your own branches to your own gerrit repo copy. in this case it does find the release number. but basically there are at least two schemes that must be supported here:

2.15-30-gbce217def3 in case a 2.15 tag is found.
gbce217def3 in case no tag is found.

"gbce217def3" if of course just an example, you won't find that commit :D

So what's the verdict? Relax completely and risk false positives, or just make the ".+-\\d+-" part in the second alternative of the regexp optional?

Taking into account the unlikelyhood of false positives and the rather small'ish impact of them, i'd rather have simpler code. But I won't object making the regex more complicated either ;)
