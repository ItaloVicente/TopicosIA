DESCRIPTION:

ConfigureGerritAfterCloneTask - relax reply matching

Gerrit nightly/snapshot builds will contain only the source revision in
the gerrit version reply - this should still be discovered.

The current implementation is paranoid regarding others returning a
"gerrit version" string which is wrong. I think even IF such a GIT
server implementation would exist, the impact of falsely detecting
Gerrit is less severe than not detecting a Gerrit.

Just remembered that we also have bug 521461 -- for which we may need a way to detect the Gerrit version. So probably removing the check altogether is counter-productive: we'll have to re-add something similar later. Unless we could do for bug 521461 a more targeted feature test instead of a version test...

Sorry I didn't think of that sooner.

Yeah well, you're right. Thinking of it the problem over there is even more severe. If I build my own Gerrit, and the version number is just the commit ID, how would I be able to determine whether to use refs/drafts/ or %private?

No problem at all :) I fixed our build after all (by pushing all upstream tags to our in house repo), so I now have "proper" formatted versions again now.

Exactly. That's why I mentioned a "more targeted feature test". If we can figure out whether the server wants %private or still does refs/drafts by testing exactly for that instead of for the version, that'd be much better. But I don't know how to do such a feature test. I wish the gerrit server-info endpoint returned also the version and some indication which magic refs it supports.
