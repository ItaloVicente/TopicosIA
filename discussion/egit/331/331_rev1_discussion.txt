DESCRIPTION:

Add content proposal to Git Wizards URI field

Add a content proposal to the URI field so that
the end user can see a list of previously used
URIs in the Git wizards (GitCloneWizard, PushWizard)
for easy re-use of these URIs.
The URIs are only added if an import or push was 
completed successfully.

Looks good, I just have two small improvement proposals:

- You could also save the URI from the fetch wizard (FetchWizard.java)
- I would prefer that the content proposals were filtered by the content of the inpout field.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:834, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RepositorySelectionPage.java -> You could use the content of the input field to filter the list of proposals. The list of proposals may be very long.
