Looks good to me. A couple of suggestions for improvement.
Line:130, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Maybe consider replacing this with PLUGIN_ID, and then doing an in-line of this method across callers?

Line:219, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> This seems superfluous now that you're hard-coding it in PLUGIN_ID above?

Thanks for looking at this, Alex!
Line:219, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Correct, but I wanted these changes to focus on the OSGi service. Once this is in, a further step is of course to get rid of getPluginId().

Sounds good re: future PLUGIN_ID change.

One thing to note: this change will mean EGit is activated earlier than it was before. As soon as the debug plugin loads, it will call this to set up the debug options, which in turn will cause the Activator to be loaded. If we can get the activator's busy work out into separate DS components then this should result in a faster speed-up, but if it's being activated too early you could consider putting in the same block that you have for the workbench ready in the prior component that was migrated.

I mention in case the progress bar of starting Eclipse seems to blip a bit earlier than before, when most of the delay is usually towards the end of the startup.

The good news is that if we manage to evict the Activator code completely with this, then the delay in loading classes won't block the startup at all :)
Line:219, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Ack
