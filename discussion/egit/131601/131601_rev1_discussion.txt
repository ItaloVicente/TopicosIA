I would feel better about this if bug 540303 were fixed. (There _is_ a Gerrit change for that bug already, but it needs tests.)

Thomas, I'm not sure I understand the dependency to bug 540303. I have a top-level .project in all my Git repos and never ran into bug 540303. Although, I have to admit that I rely mostly on auto-share and/or the Git Import wizard.

As I very rarely have nested projects, I don't know if bug 540303 occurs only in a special case or if it is a widespread problem. If it's only a special case, then OK, let's try with a top-level project. (I don't even import the top-level egit/jgit projects. On the rare occasions I have to edit something there, I go through the repository view.)

So JGit goes a different approach. The put the top-level .project into .gitignore.
http://git.eclipse.org/c/jgit/jgit.git/tree/.gitignore

I'm fine with that too. Thoughts?

That was done in an older commit https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/56391/ . Shawn stated back then they usually didn't commit Eclipse .project files, but they are definitely committed nowadays for the bundles. And in fact the initial JGit contribution to Eclipse definitely did already include the bundles' .project files, so I don't know what Shawn meant. The fact that /.project is ignored looks more like an unintentional left-over, or like some legacy setting designed to avoid problems with nested projects?

To me the linked bug seems like a special case. I have quite some workspaces with nested projects, and have never experienced that one.

Nevertheless I'm like Thomas, just expanding the working tree node...
