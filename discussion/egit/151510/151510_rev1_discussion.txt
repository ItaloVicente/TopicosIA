Shouldn't the display label strings be in the UI plugin and the label provider should decide which string to use for which item? Perhaps we have other such cases, but I find it strange that some enum in the core plugin should have to worry about human-readable labels.

Well, I'm not a fan of defining an enum somewhere, and then a "wrapper" for the enum somewhere else, just to add one more field to it (or even worse, a switch case over the enum and returning the label instead). If I rename "label" to "name", and create a method getLabel() in the UI plugin, which says "return action.name;" would you be more happy in that case? Cause that is basically exactly what we had before...

I think the choice of name() before was wrong; we just called some method on that object that happened to return a String. Could have used toString(), too. If we had a label provider somewhere that used Repository.toString() to get a label, would you then add a getLabel() method to Repository? Or take Eclipse Resources: labels are provided in UI label providers (typically through adapters in that case), not by the Resource.
