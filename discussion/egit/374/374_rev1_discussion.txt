DESCRIPTION:

Show a "Create Patch" context menu entry in history view
    
When one commit is selected in the commit list, the diff to
its parent can be saved to a file, together with meta-information
needed to send the patch by mail.
    
The file filter of the history view is used. The diff written to
the patch file is the same as that shown in the history view.
    
It is not possible to create patch files for the first commit and
for merge commits.

compared to the result format-patch produces I found the following differences:
- Date: header is wrong it shows current timestamp instead of timestamp of commit being exported to patch file
- first line of commit message is repeated after mail headers, format-patch puts that only in Subject: header
- no diffstats are listed before diff, format-patch by default shows diffstats, this can be suppressed using --no-stat option
- format-patch lists the git version which did format the patch after the diffs, we should list our version number here
