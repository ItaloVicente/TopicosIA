DESCRIPTION:

Include the Apache MINA ssh client

Add a preference with UI in the main Git preference page to select
between JSch and the new Apache MINA sshd client.

Read preferences from the org.eclipse.jsch.core preference node and
install a listener to pick up preference changes.

The session factory thus can use the ssh preferences as configured by
the user. For the time being, we use the ssh directory, the default
default identities, and the preferred authentication mechanisms. The
latter two can be overridden through the ssh config file, which will
be the one in the configured ssh directory. The other preferences from
org.eclipse.jsch are not taken into account; sshd may have different
algorithms available and I don't want to change preferences in a
foreign bundle.

Make the proxy service accessible in the EGit core activator, and use
it in a ProxyDatabase in the EclipseSshdSessionFactory.

The EclipseSshdSessionFactory has no key cache. Eclipse is a
long-running application, and keeping ssh keys in memory for that long
is most probably not wise. Instead re-load keys whenever they are
needed, and use an IdentityPasswordProvider (which provides passwords
for encrypted private key files) that use the Eclipse secure storage
for key passphrases to avoid repeatedly asking the user for the same
passphrases for the same keys.
