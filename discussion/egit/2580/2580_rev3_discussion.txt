Unfortunately this is not true (see screenshot I sent via separate email), I suspect that there is a problem with the menu activation rules in repositories view if the repository is empty.

I thought we could show the information that the repo is empty on the label decorator of the repository (in repositories view) / 
project level (package explorer).

We don't need to change any action in repositories view because all actions appears only on branch/tag level, since there are no branch and tags they aren't show in context menu. I've also add some code to disable push/fetch actions when there are no remotes and disable synchronize action when HEAD cannot be resolved. In case of changing tool tips for disabled action, I don't know how to achievieve this ... I'm afraid that we can't change them or display on show on disabled elements.
