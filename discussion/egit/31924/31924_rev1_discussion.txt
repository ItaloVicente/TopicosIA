Thanks for working on this!

What I don't like about this change is the configuration part. So it would show the "Push Branch" wizard. Problems:

* There's not enough context to know which repository it is about.
* The labels are wrong ("Push Branch").
* The user can deselect "Configure upstream", in which case the repository is still not configured after the wizard is finished.
* The "Force" option doesn't have any effect.

I recommend undoing the configuration parts of this change:

* Just push the repositories that are configured, and skip the others.
* In the result dialog, list the unconfigured repositories so that it can be seen what the problem with them was.
* Leave the special case to use "Push Branch..." for a single repository.

Configuring them one by one is not really more work, and in the individual wizard the user will be able to confirm/correct the result.

(By the way, can you work on multi fetch next? ;])
