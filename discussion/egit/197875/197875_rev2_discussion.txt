Line:508, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> What about tags?

I would have expected this check to be inside executeOpenCommandWithConfirmation(), and check that the commit being referenced (if any; a tag might reference a blob) equals HEAD.

Like you I'm unsure whether a check-out does anything useful if the commit to be checked out == HEAD. If it does not, that check might need to be done in other places, too.

Line:508, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> Sounds reasonable. I'll try to move this to the execute... method instead.

Line:508, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> Just realized that for branches your code is actually right. If we have two branches pointing at the same commit and have one checked out, checking out the other should still be possible.

For tags, one does have to check the commit being pointed to.

Line:508, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> In fact, I realized the same only after implementation. I had code that resolved everything to ObjectId and compared those, and then noticed I can no longer switch from current branch to another branch pointing to same commit.
That's why I effectively reverted all of that, and really just compare refName and repo.getFullBranch. I'm aware that doesn't avoid the checkout for tags, but I'm honestly not sure if trying to use the commit in the case of tags wouldn't lead to similar wrong situations in some cases (e.g. 2 branches and 1 tag pointing all to the same commit, and then switching from branch A to tag and then to branch B).

That's why in the end I would be happy with the simple solution that avoids this only for branches, since that is the 99% solution, and running the operation is not an error (similar like before).
