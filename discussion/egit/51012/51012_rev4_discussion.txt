DESCRIPTION:

Do not automatically ignore paths not found by the treewalk

RepositoryUtil.isIgnored(path) is used to check if the resource should
be added to the .gitignore by IgnoreDerivedResources and
IgnoreOperation.

However if the TreeWalk can't *find* the path "isIgnored" returns
"false", but probably should return "true" in the same way as if the
mapping were missing.

To not break API, the old "isIgnored" method is deprecated and new one
"canBeAutoIgnored" is added instead, with different behavior. Added &
fixed javadoc and tests.

Like it. I would only remove @deprecated and only explain the functionality of isIgnored() better.
Line:476, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/RepositoryUtil.java -> For me it look's strange that somebody who was previously calling isIgnored() to find out whether a path is ignored is now guided to use a method "canBeAutoIgnored()". I like the new method canBeAutoIgnored() but I can imagine that in future we have more arguments why pathes should be auto-ignoreable or not. The fact whether a path is already in the ignored resources is only one argument.

Therefore I would like to seperate the questions isIgnored() and canBeAutIgnored(). I suggest that we only update the javadoc of this method saying that it only works on existing pathes. In the end I think we need both methods.
