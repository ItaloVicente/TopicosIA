DESCRIPTION:

Fix list of branches in Switch To... menu

There were two issues which are fixed with this commit:
- The currently checked out branch was not correctly disabled in the
list of the not recently used local branches.
- If no branch was extracted from the reflog also no list of not
recently used local branches was shown.
