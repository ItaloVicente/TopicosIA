DESCRIPTION:

Branch selection dialog improvements

This dialog can be invoked via the BranchActionHandler, which is
a default handler. Make sure the dialogs say in which repository
they operate; it may not be obvious if invoked via Quick Access.
Pre-select the current branch, if any, in the dialog, so that when
clicking "New branch..." there is a default base set.

Also give the BranchActionHandler a description.

Looks good to me. I was wondering if we should create a reusable component for the "repo icon + repository name and decorator" part that we already have in some of the views. It would probably fit quite nicely at the top of the content area of many similar dialogs.

Totally unrelated side questions: I started using the "Rebase" feature of gerrit to "stack" changes with +2 on top of each other for easier mass-building and mass-merging just today (didn't even know that feature before). Does that have any unwanted side effects (I think I remember you doing such merge/rebase chains locally in the past instead)?

Second question: Is it generally accepted to fix merge conflicts of others, if that is the only thing remaining for submitting the change? If so, that would ease the "chaining".

I think yes to both. Just note: our builds seem to be especially unstable when several of them run. I'm not sure stacking helps a lot right now in terms of getting things in quicker. And fast-forward merging the stack on submit will trigger several product builds; all but the top one can be safely aborted.

And anyway: if we care about a linear history, then we could also simply set the submission rule for the repo to "Rebase if necessary". And if we don't, we could just submit without stacking.

I think I suggested "Rebase if necessary" very early in my egit contribution time, but it was rejected. Platform changed to that strategy recently because Karsten Thoms and I had made that suggestion at EclipseCon 2018, based on my experience in our company, where "rebase if necessary" lead to roughly 2 incorrect merges per year over several years. And the rate of builds failing for _other_ reasons was higher, therefore we totally accepted that in my company (but meanwhile we no longer use gerrit).

I would be totally happy to use "Rebase if necessary" here, too.
