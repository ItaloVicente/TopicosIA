DESCRIPTION:

sort tags descending by default

As the latest tags are usually of more interest than the first, tags are
sorted descending rather than ascending by default. In order to allow
users to restore the tag sort order used in previous versions, a
corresponding toggle command is added.

In a separate change, I tried to investigate build failures in the TagActionTest. It seems that the bot started working when the tag tree was not fully populated. This is why more asserts were added when doing the selection.
My hope is that the test behaves more deterministic now and gives more helpful information if it fails.

Line:104, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/TagActionTest.java -> We tried hard to avoid most arbitrary waits from our tests. (I know there's still quite a few, and the various joinJobs or similar operations contains some themselves.)

Looking at that FILL_TAG_LIST job, I think this job should work differently:

1. It must return Job.ASYNC_FINISH.
2. It must call done(Status.OK_STATUS) from within the asyncExec runnable (in a try-finally).

Unfortunately this pattern of "run normal job, perform asyncExec, return OK_STATUS" is fairly common in EGit, but it's wrong and makes testing a nightmare.

Another approach is to use a normal job and a job change listener that then schedules a UIJob or WorkbenchJob, but for testing that probably also would need to have a family.

Line:104, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/TagActionTest.java -> Should this be done within this change or rather in a separate one? I understand about avoiding arbitrary waits, but in this case the precondition for the asserts was not met due to not waiting long enough... and tracking the (a) reason was a nightmare, in particular as locally in Eclipse the tests pass and a simple maven install on EGit did not work locally (no thorough investigation yet).

Line:104, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/TagActionTest.java -> Give it a try with that FILL_TAG_LIST job. Just schedule a UIJob instead of doing the asyncExec, and give that UIJob also the FILL_TAG_LIST family. Then just wait for the family in the test.

Line:116, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/TagActionTest.java -> There is a rowCount() method. Would be clearer to use that and compare against the expected value.

Line:119, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/test/team/actions/TagActionTest.java -> That's an anti-pattern in tests. Just let the exception propagate.
