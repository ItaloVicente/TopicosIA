DESCRIPTION:

sort tags descending by default

As the latest tags are usually of more interest than the first, tags are
sorted descending rather than ascending by default. In order to allow
users to restore the tag sort order used in previous
versions, a corresponding toggle command is added.

PS 4 brings the old tag sorting code to the current state. Further, I have tried to use the tag sorting order chosen by the user in all places (I found) where tags are listed.

Line:35, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> Hmmmm... somehow I don't like this dependency from CommonUtils to repo.tree.command. Perhaps a command state is not the right choice for this. How about a normal preference, settable on some preference page? To quickly toggle, we could still have the command in the repo view, which would then toggle that global preference.

Line:76, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> Can we delay determining this initial value until it's really needed? This static block makes me a bit nervous... Also: does the state listener to be unregistered?

Line:26, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/ToggleTagSortingCommand.java -> Not needed. The framework maintains this, and if you need the constant, there's RegistryToggleState.STATE_ID.

I have tried to address your comments without going the preference store way. With respect to the Repositories View, the toggle commands already integrate so well.

(Pending your approval of the approach, should the command id string be changed?)
Line:35, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> I understand. How about keeping a command state because it already integrates well with the Repositories View's refresh but inversing the dependency.

Line:76, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> Done

The proposed change does not need the sate listener here. (How - or more precisely when - could you unregister the listener if the class is static?)

Line:26, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/ToggleTagSortingCommand.java -> Done. This was a leftover from when I copied the pattern used in the existing toggle commands... Are they still necessary at all? They do nothing but define the ID. These IDs could get different names and move to the AbstractToggleCommand.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:26, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/ToggleTagSortingCommand.java -> Indeed, I meant using one concrete generic ToggleCommandClass (possibly with a callback providing the new state, in case a subclass has to react to the new toggle state). After all the state to toggle is not determined by the class but by the command id.

However, I think this refactoring should not be done in this change.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:26, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/ToggleTagSortingCommand.java -> If you don't have the concrete class, how'd you write the plugin.xml? Or did you mean change AbstractToggleCommand to a concrete class ToggleCommand, move all IDs there, perhaps move the class over to egit.ui.internal.commands? That might be a solution... thinking about it: funny that there is no such general ToggleCommand class in platform already.
