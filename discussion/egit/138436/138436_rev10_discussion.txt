DESCRIPTION:

sort tags descending by default

As the latest tags are usually of more interest than the first, tags are
sorted descending rather than ascending by default. In order to allow
users to restore the tag sort order used in previous versions, a
corresponding toggle command is added.

Thanks for working on this :-)

Can you provide the toggling of the sort order in all the UI elements where this is used ?
Line:66, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> I'd move this to ToggleTagSortingCommand

Line:75, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> seems a bit strange to keep tag specific state in a class called CommonUtils, can we move this to ToggleTagSortingCommand ?

Line:169, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> I think a Comparator called ASCENDING_COMPARATOR should not sort in descending order. Instead the caller should find out if it's reverse and then call reversed() on this ascending comparator

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html#reversed--

It also seems strange that this reverse handling is only done for tags but not for other refs within the same method

Line:211, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> I'd move that to the caller and use reversed() to reverse the sort order which makes this method obsolete

Line:220, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchSelectionDialog.java -> nit: start body of anonymous class with a blank line

I would not expect to change the sort order for tags in the repositories view when using the Push tags dialog (or any of the other dialogs). And I also feel it is overkill to have a persisted toggle state for every dialog where tags are shown.

Personally, I'd make the sort order configurable only for the repositories view, but as stated in one of the file comment replies, I was asked to use the same sort order everywhere.
Line:66, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> This might lead to an infinite review loop. See the comment by Thomas Wolf for PS 4 on March, 15.

Line:75, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> Without a dependency from here to the Toggle-Command, this was the easiest way. The final location may depend on design decisions made elsewhere.

Line:169, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> So far, all refs were always sorted ascending. I'd have no problem renaming the comparator to "REF_COMPARATOR".
The caller does not always now which ref types are sorted, so it cannot make the decision.

Regarding the restriction to tags. My original bug report claimed that for tags (only) the ascending sort order (in the repositories view) was not what the user generally wanted. One of the replies to the repo-view-only-fix was that the sorting of tags should be the same everywhere.
The "correct" change would be not to sort by tag name at all, but by tag date (well or let the user choose by name/date ascending/descending).
Other sort methods for other ref types was never in the scope of this change and would possibly require a completely different approach (sort preference page for all types).

Line:211, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> This would duplicate a lot of code. Maybe CommonUtils is just not the right place for the comparators. A UiComparators class could be used instead.
But I still think that it is not a good idea to force every class that wants to get tag strings sorted to know that there are different sortings and when to use which.

Line:66, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> I had objected to the import of ...internal.repository.tree.command.ToggleTagSortingCommand here in CommonUtils, which I somehow perceived as rather out of place.

After https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/160136/ this new ID could be placed in...internal.commands.ToggleCommand.

Line:169, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> I'm honestly not sure if reversing the sort order based on the name is indeed the correct implementation for bug 545240. As I understand it, the goal is to have the most recent tags at the top. To achieve that reliably, one would need to sort by commit date of the commit the tag points to.

In the EGit repo reversing the order based on the name would bring the newest tags to the top. In the JDT repo, you'd first get all Y-tags, then the R-tags, then the P-tags, then the M-tags, and finally the I-tags. Is that really what's wanted? (No matter whether ascending or descending, yesterday's I-tag will always be somewhere in the middle of a long list.)

Perhaps use a preference for this after all? I'd suggest to let the user choose between sorting refs alphabetically ascending or descending or sorting by commit date. If you want, give the user the possibility to choose different orders for branches vs. tags. Keep the sort order for "branch hierarchy" nodes fixed at alphabetically ascending.

Line:169, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CommonUtils.java -> When writing the bug report, I had simple tag verions in mind. 9.0.0, 9.0.1, 9.1.2, 10.0.0, where the inverse "natural" ordering already more or less corrensponds to the time. For finding a version in the list, this variant will be easiest (what if there is a 10.0.0-Version, but many, many 9.x bugfix-versions created later? And it sounds like for JDT, a hierarchical structure would be needed as well).

All I wanted was to reverse the current ordering of tags in the Repositories View, because when comparing a local branch with a recent tag, you always may have to scroll through a long list of old tags; while allowing the user to restore the current sorting as the new one was to be default.

Is it really worth the effort to turn this into a make-everything-configurable-in-all-possible-ways change? I am also not convinced of the usefulness of sorting branches by last commit date. This may cause the order of branches to change with every fetch.

How about a completely different approach: keep the sort orders unchanged, but give the user a way to filter in the repositories view. Proof-of-concept in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/160160/ .

Change has become obsolete with the ability to filter tags in the RepositoriesView.
