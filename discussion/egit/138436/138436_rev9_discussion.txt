DESCRIPTION:

sort tags descending by default

As the latest tags are usually of more interest than the first, tags are
sorted descending rather than ascending by default. In order to allow
users to restore the tag sort order used in previous versions, a
corresponding toggle command is added.

The tests fail with similar symptoms as before, although now they pass the table item count assert. Is the sorting done outside the job we wait for? Does the item change after selection or does the bot simply select the wrong one?

I noticed. I'll run this in a CentOS VM. It _is_ possible that SWT/GTK has a bug. There were already problems earlier on, see the comment in testConvertAnnotatedTagIntoLightWeight().

It is indeed the same problem. After the dialog opens, the tags are there:

  SomeTag
  SomeLightTag

but then selecting the second one via getTableItem("SomeLightTag") just doesn't work; it selects the first item. Whenever that happens, the tests go haywire.

So it's indeed the changed sort order that makes these tests now hit that problem.

I'll see if I can come up with a fix.

What I did in one of the attempts to fixing was not selecting the item by label but iterating through the items, check for label equality and then select the item with the corresponding index. I could adapt the test correspondingly.

Oh, and I did an clear input and unselect in the table as well. I had not seen the comment - it would have saved me a lot of time...

Maybe it suffices, to activate lines 101-104.

There's another problem in CreateTagDialog. In the annotated-to-lightweight case, the solution was to simply set the text field instead of selecting in the table. If I do the same in the lightweight-to-annotated case, the "Force overwrite" button never gets enabled. That also needs to be fixed.
