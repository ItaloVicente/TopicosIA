I created a local branch with two commits (change default sorting, add togglie for sorting) but was not able to push this branch. Making several commits is in line with the contributor's guide (granularity). But how to do that with Gerrit? It does not make sense to me to push the first commit and then *amend* it with the second. Commits with different concerns should remain separate!?

Should have worked. What exactly didn't work? What error message did you get?

I started from master, created a new branch. Then I created two commits. Both including dummy Change-ID and signed-off. When pushing this branch, it complained of illegal change ids (I don't have the specific error message anymore)...
When trying to reproduce the problem today, there was no error!? One difference was, that I reworded both commits, which I did not do today. Maybe this was causing the problem. Anyway, now I know that pushing multiple commits works... basically.

Whenever I got complaints of colleagues about not being able to push multiple commits, then it was caused by one of the commits not having a change id.

Do you have a green overlay at the egit repo icon? If not, please following this from the user guide: "If a repository cloned from a Gerrit server outside of EGit is used in EGit, the clone may not be set up such that EGit recognizes it as a Gerrit repository. Gerrit operations in EGit will not appear in any menus unless you configure your repository first. To do that, open the Git Repositories view and browse down to the Remote that represents the Git repository server you want to use and select Gerrit Configuration...."

Line:5100, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Many users remember menus by position, not by text. Adding a new menu in between existing menus should therefore only be done if there is a good reason. Otherwise it should go to the end, if it does not really matter.

Line:335, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryTreeNode.java -> As mentioned in the other change, it is a bad practice to negate the result of compare(). According to the contract, compare() can return any integer value. Negating the minimum integer value leads to an overflow. Even though that is not a problem here, we try hard to avoid any new static code analysis warnings, therefore please call the comparator two times instead.

One more general design discussion: I'm aware that the bug targets the repository view only. However, with this change the repository view sorts different than all other views/dialogs that contain tags somewhere (e.g. AbstractBranchSelectionDialog, PullResultDialog, CommitEditor, History info section etc.).

I would therefore suggest to have the menu item toggle a preference (without adding it to the preference pages), to have a method in CommonUtils for sorting references, which follows that preference, and finally to redirect all sorting of tags in any dialog to that CommonUtils method.

That way everything would stay in sync. Feel free to move the discussion about this issue to the bug, since gerrit is not meant for extended discussions.

I'd like the to wait for the result of the "sort tags the same way everywhere" discussion before addressing the comments.
