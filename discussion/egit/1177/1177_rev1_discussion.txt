DESCRIPTION:

Cleanup Handler usage in plugin.xml

Currently we reference the default handlers by subelements which in
turn are designed to take parameters. Instead, the defaultHandler
attribute can be used in case we have no-parameter handlers
as it is today. With this we can get rid of all the unnessesary
warnings in the plugin.xml.

Absolutely. My fault... Unfortunately, this introduces tabs, while the rest of the file is formatted using spaces.
