DESCRIPTION:

Add code search to Git Code Search (Prototype)

This is a proof of concept for adding code search into Git Search. This
type of search is not covered by File Search as repositories need not be
present the workspace. The commit is intended as the starter for a
discussion whether this feature should be considered at all.

Only the head version of the working tree is checked for the pattern
(checked out branch or all branches depending on search settings).
In this minimal implementation a search hit causes a sysout of
repository name, branch name and file path.

Sure this is interesting! I do git grep daily. Please check bugzilla and if there is no feature request for this, please create one and link to this patch.

Implementing git grep for sure is interesting.

Please first implement a GrepCommand in the org.eclipse.jgit.api package and a corresponding command line command in org.eclipse.jgit.pgm. Then this can be used in egit to integrate it into Eclipse.

I found Bug 443043 for EGit. As I indicated there, the clean solution is beyond the scope I had in mind - implementing full git grep is a different order of magnitude.

That said, what would you think should be the scope of an initial grep command (supported options), what should be the granularity of the result ...?

Also, from what I see in the git grep documentation, the search is restricted to the checked-out working tree, correct? What I intended with the first patch was searching in other branches as well (without checking them out).

With respect to the Git Search, I would not want to introduce too many options. I had a single additional checkbox "Code" in mind, in the search result, maybe a code sub-entry per repository. In the first iteration I would only list the files with matches (opening files in the workspace, in current working tree of a repository and highlighting matches would come much later).

With this use case in mind, a very basic grep command would suffice (single pattern, no path filters, no line of match, no column of match...). The question is, would you be happy with starting out this way, in particular if the command line version would not really correspond to git grep.

Line:270, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/search/CommitSearchQuery.java -> Would need to take into account character encoding here, and of course CR/LF and smudge filters.

Abandoned as it is beyond me to implement the jgit functionality.
