DESCRIPTION:

Execute cleanup "Push down negations"

Push down negations to make reading of complex expressions with
negations easier.

Additionally to running the cleanup I intended to enable the
corresponding setting in the project properties, but unfortunately there
is a bug in the cleanup, which would lead to non-compiling code in egit,
if it were enabled: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=558635

Therefore we can only enable the cleanup in the properties after that
bug has been fixed and a new Eclipse version is released.

Line:177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitCombo.java -> Personally I find

  index < 0

simpler to parse.

Line:165, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitCreatePatchWizard.java -> That's *much* clearer!

Line:583, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/LocationPage.java -> isDirectory() => exists(), so just

  if (!parent.isDirectory()) {

would be good enough?

Line:1160, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> I don't find that any clearer.

Line:177, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CommitCombo.java -> Indeed. I wasn't aware that the refactoring can lead to "unusal order" of expressions due to the negation, since I had focused on boolean operations when I investigated its bugs.

I will change both comparisons to be in the expected order.

Line:583, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/LocationPage.java -> Yes

Line:1160, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> I guess you don't find that any cleaner because the instanceof requires additional braces for the negation due to operator precendence. In the other refactorings the number of braces was reduced, here it isn't.

Still, I would want to merge this change, because it is created by the cleanup-on-save, when we enable "push down negations". And the cleanup itself should be enabled, since it _generally_ makes the distance between the negation and the negated operator shorter, thereby reducing the chance if mis-interpretation of the negation during reading.

Unfortunately this is exactly the line that revealed a bug in the cleanup (it does not add braces around instanceof), therefore we cannot enabled the cleanup _yet_.

Line:1160, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> Forget the last part about not being able to enable the cleanup due to the bug. When the bug occurs, it can be fixed manually and will not occur again. Therefore I've now enabled the cleanup-on-save in PS3.
