DESCRIPTION:

Import a project set file

Very simple implementation:
- checks out 'master' branch (hard-coded)
- creates a local repository with o.e.e.core.op.CloneOperation in
  <workspaceroot>/<humanish-git-url> (hard-coded) for every unique
  repository from the project's reference.
- connects checked out projects with
  o.e.e.core.op.ConnectProviderOperation

No UI interaction had been implemented yet.

Patch Set 4: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

- error messages improved
- don't clone if destination directory exists (with detailed error message)

It still requires a compatibility layer. Unfortunately, providing it as an optional dependency not a good solution from the user's PoV: if a compatibility layer is missing there will be no feedback provided by team framework. Should be moved to a feature patch or separate feature to not mandating a compatibility layer for EGit.

Ok, I've got it now. Your comment was about exporting PSF, which was intentionally not implemented at all in this patchset.
