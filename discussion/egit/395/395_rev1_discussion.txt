DESCRIPTION:

Proof of concept for tagging dialog

It is only a proof of concept for tagging dialog. Before I'll send a full
patch I want to be sure that tagging action is performed correctly, so
please review only BranchSelectionDialog class lines 424 - 442.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I usually avoid EGit UI stuff.  The code seems sane from a JGit API usage perspective, it should create a tag and store it.  My -1 score here is because there are some obvious things to be cleaned up before we can submit this, but its at least heading in the right direction and shouldn't be hard to polish up and submit.

Shawn, can you review the JGit tagging code mentioned by Dariusz?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:417, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchSelectionDialog.java -> This code is complex enough that it might justify a new top level method, rather than being buried down within a selection listener.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:425, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchSelectionDialog.java -> This TODO obviously needs to be addressed before submitting the change.  Ideally the text would be obtained at the same time as the tag name, so another field in the same dialog.

Line:442, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/BranchSelectionDialog.java -> You need to check the result to make sure it was actually created.
