DESCRIPTION:

Improve presentation in project sharing dialog

Improve presentation of relative directories when there are multiple choices
for the .git directory. In particular the project was presented as '/' instead
of '.' for the case in the subject line of this issue. It does not fix Bug
297163, but perhaps makes it less likely that the user chooses the wrong .git
directory.

We also add tests for this case.
