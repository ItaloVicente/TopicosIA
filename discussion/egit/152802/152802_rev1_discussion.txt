DESCRIPTION:

Adapt RepositoryTreeNode to File

RepositoryTreeNode already has getPath method. It makes sense to provide
this location information via IAdaptable. This is the case in particular
for nodes representing existing paths, i.e. repostory, base working
directory as well as the files and folders therein.

What's the intended use case or expected benefit? There is no obvious user visible change when running in a plain debug environment. However, I remember from other eclipse based applications that I had a hard time to get rid of _unwanted_ team menu entries on arbitrary objects (like diagram nodes) just because they adapted to IFile, and the team UI contributed its menu items to anything adapting to IFile. I'm therefore rather hesitant to just some adapters that might lead to similar effects in bigger installations.

Sorry! I abandoned https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/150647/ a while back and rather than re-opening it, I started a new change. Please see the short discussion there. The intention is to give other plugins access to the available location information without having to declare an explicit dependency to Egit.

I'd be fine, if rejected the change for the reason you gave.

So the original change had exactly the problems I also saw somewhere else. Like Thomas, I believe it should be fine with adapting to File, since I have never seen unwanted menu or object contributions for that. Basically +1 except for the wrong method name.
Line:407, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryTreeNode.java -> @Alexander: No longer correct.

Line:417, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryTreeNode.java -> @Thomas: This is exactly the kind of null guard hiding code that I mentioned some days ago in another change. Now you can see it live and in color. :)

I am not sure, whether you'd like me to modify the NPE-guard.
Line:407, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryTreeNode.java -> Will be renamed (just waiting for a pointer with respect to the second comment).

Line:417, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryTreeNode.java -> Please, don't think that I am in love with this type of code. If you can live with the *potential* NPE, I'll gladly simplify this to getPath().toFile() or write it out in an explicit if-statement. (Please let me know, before I submit an updated change.)

I'm not really clear about that either. Right now, the egit code base doesn't contain Optional.map() based null guards at all (at least I'm not aware). I personally don't use them, unless the related code really deals with streams. I.e. not for null checks _only_. Therefore I would rather write if-based null guards. But I also use way more @NonNull in other projects, therefore I almost never need null checks there.

If you also don't really like the map based code, let's convert it to ifnn for the moment, such that the code base is more consistent.

IMO this is an abuse of Optional. Compare https://dzone.com/articles/using-optional-correctly-is-not-optional , I'd think this falls under point 12.

Personally I'm happier with simple old-style

  IPath path = getPath();
  return path != null ? path.toFile() : null;

which has no extra object allocations, no extra function calls, no extra null checks.

Besides, these "// fall through" comments are not necessary.
