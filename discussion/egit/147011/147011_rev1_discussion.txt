DESCRIPTION:

Suppress workspace refresh during git clean

While a long running clean command is still processed, the periodic
workspace refresh already triggers workspace auto builds repeatedly.
That leads to performance loss due to restarting the build every some
seconds, and it may lead to the build starting in "half-cleaned" states,
therefore having unnecessary build errors.

To avoid this, wrap the clean command with a workspace operation, that
delivers notifications only after the clean.

Line:289, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clean/CleanRepositoryPage.java -> I'm not sure of this, it's basically copy/paste from line 300. Anyone with a different opinion on any of those 2 suppressed exceptions?

Line:289, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clean/CleanRepositoryPage.java -> 1. Why can't this try-catch be combined with the one below?

2. JGit's CleanCommand is going to use the java.io.File API, not the Eclipse IFile API, so I don't see how wrapping this in a workspace action is going to change anything?

3. JGit's using the java.io.File API is the reason for the refreshes below.

If Eclipse picks up file system changes asynchronously ("automatic refresh"), I guess changes done by the CleanCommand might trigger builds. If so, running the command inside the same workspace action as the refreshes, and using the projects as scheduling rule, might perhaps help. But it might also block the workspace for longer.

Line:289, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clean/CleanRepositoryPage.java -> 1. Will change that, of course.

2. and 3. I can assure you, the clean command might not only trigger builds, it does (at least on Windows and with the automatic refresh enabled). I've seen clean commands cleaning all target directories in a big workspace, where the automatic build was starting more than 10 times, with some seconds delay in between.

I guess you suggest a org.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs.MultiRule with every affected project as child as SchedulingRule (I have never used that class before) for both. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

I'm not sure whether having 2 separate workspace actions or just 1 is better, since I don't know how repeated and out of order change notifications are handled. If everything is just one workspace operation, then the notifications created by automatic refresh are only handled after we already refreshed manually. Would that late handling of notifications be a no-op or really refresh everything twice? I had assumed that when using 2 operations the asynchronously collected notifications would be dealt with before our manual refresh starts, and the manual refresh would create almost no additional notifications anymore. That being said, I can also go with just one operation and watch how it behaves with the nightly at work.
