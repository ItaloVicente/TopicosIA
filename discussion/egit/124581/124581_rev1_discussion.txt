DESCRIPTION:

Fix CommitUI.getSelectedFiles()

This method is used to restrict the files that can be potentially
committed to those covered by the user's resource selection. If a
container is selected, all modified files under that container are
to be included in a commit.

Previous code started off with the modified files as known in git,
then tried to figure out which resource such a file was in Eclipse,
and then checked if that resource was contained by any of the selected
resources. It failed to reliably identify matches when a file appeared
as several resources in the Eclipse resource tree.

The new code swaps the logic around. It starts with the resource
selection and finds the repository-relative paths for all, and then
filters the modified files as known in git.

Line:286, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitUI.java -> can you please add a comment here? I had to think for quite some time for the idea that this sorts shorter paths first, and that in turn will match the items in the following loop faster.
