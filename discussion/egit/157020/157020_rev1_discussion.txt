DESCRIPTION:

Filter jgit.benchmarks and jgit.coverage from import

Exclude jgit.benchmarks and jgit.coverage via name based filters during
the Oomph project import. The predicate solution looks more simple to
understand than the alternative implementation via excludedPaths pattern
at the source locator.

This change is untested.

Line:233, tools/oomph/EGit.setup -> Shouldn't that be *. instead of .* ? Also below.

Line:233, tools/oomph/EGit.setup -> No. Those are regex, and I mean to match anything.

There was some way how one could test that locally (I know Ed Merks once explained how to do it), but I have forgotten the steps... There is a way to tell Oomph to use the local setup file instead of the remote one.
Line:233, tools/oomph/EGit.setup -> Ack.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> why do you want to skip importing the benchmarks project ? It has source code and we may want to add more benchmarks.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> See bug 559741: these two projects cannot resolve the dependencies in the Eclipse workspace, so the workspace is never error-free. (I don't know exactly why, though.) I always remove these two projects from my workspace because of that.

I tried to run the 2019-12 installer on Mac and selected
- Eclipse for committers
- EGit installer
- target platform 2020-03

The installation went through without errors and all projects are built, benchmark and coverage projects don't show errors so it seems I cannot reproduce the problem

You probably had run a maven command-line build before. So your local .m2 repo would have 5.7.0-SNAPSHOT versions of the referenced bundles, and m2e would use those to resolve the dependencies.

If so, could we avoid these errors by adding a JGIT snapshot repository to the POMs?

Adding

  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>jgit-snapshots</id>
      <url>https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/jgit-snapshots/</url>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </snapshots>
    </repository>
  </repositories>

in the coverage pom.xml did download the bundles during the m2e build, and once my local .m2 had those bundles, the errors disappeared. But I fear doing so might give us interference between local builds and whatever that snapshot repo contains.

Can oomph be made to have a step (before building the projects) to populate the local m2 repo once (and only if no snapshot versions are already in .m2) from that snapshot repo?

@Ed: any hints how we could achieve that in oomph ?

Guys, I'm reviewing and testing your setup.

There is some room for improvement.  E.g., it would seem better to set eclipse.target.plaform's value to None instead of setting the defaultValue to None.  Also, it would seem better to use your own variable for the target task so that you can choose any one of your *.target files for the target platform, rather than hard coding this value.

A simpler way to avoid importing the projects is to exclude the ones with a m2e nature...

Oomph does have a launch task, so if there were a launch configuration in the workspace that could be used to launch an m2e build, that could be triggered automatically.

I don't know exactly how m2e works. Does it allow a maven/tycho build without maven installed on the actual machine?
