DESCRIPTION:

Filter jgit.benchmarks and jgit.coverage from import

Exclude jgit.benchmarks and jgit.coverage via nature filters during
the Oomph project import. The predicate solution is simpler to
understand than the alternative implementation via excludedPaths pattern
at the source locator.

Also eliminate the prompting of the variable value for
eclipse.target.platform by setting the value to none.

Provide a variable for prompting for the egit target platform which
defaults to the first value in the list of choices.

Also assign an ID to the working set task so that the pending changes in
Oomph's serialization will kick in the next time you edit with the
latest version of Oomph.  The goal is to make the serialization more
robust with respect to task additions/removals in combination with any
subsequent textual merging.

I would suggest going with this version for now, until you've resolved
how you want to automatically do a Maven build that would correct the
errors in the two excluded projects.

I assume the test failures are unrelated to any and all changes in the setup...

I tried this version and found the installation doesn't set the selected target platform so I had to set it manually. Not sure why this happens.

I'm not exactly sure what you mean, but definitely if you try to perform in an existing workspace with this modified setup you'll be prompted for the EGit Target Platform, and can choose.  The one you've been using is the first choice so will be selected by default.  Once you've performed, and saved this variable as a result, it won't be prompted again in that workspace.

For an initial setup, the user/contributor will also be prompted, but then too, the value will be saved and used for his workspace setup.

So I expect all is good and fine in this regard.

Note that to test that the setup indeed doesn't import the current unwanted projects, you can delete all the projects from the workspace and perform the import task again to see that the projects with m2e nature are not imported...
