DESCRIPTION:

Fixes obtaining common ancestor in Synchronize view

For obtaining common base ancestor I've used suggested RevWalk with
RevFilter.MERGE_BASE. For API compatibility it is also used for
obtaining remote variant.

This patch also improves GitResourceVariant implementation. I replaced
all dependencies to deprecated TreeEntry with proper RevObject
implementation. This have also requires to update test cases.

I've run GitSyncInfo test using original SyncInfo implementation and for now only one test case fails. I'll investigate this test case, maybe I've made some logical mistake ...

I'm wondering with implementation would be more efficient and what would be time execution difference.

I've use TPTP to test execution time of GitSyncInfo and SyncInfo. I've run GitSyncInfo test and it seams that SyncInfo is around 1-2s faster then GitSyncInfo.

I think that in this case, we should replace use of GitSyncInfo with default SyncInfo, therefore both classes (GitSyncInfo and GitSyncInfoTest) should be removed.
