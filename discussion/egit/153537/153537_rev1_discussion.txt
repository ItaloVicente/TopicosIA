I think we should show hooks output by default. Popups are "evil", but here I think we really want them.
Haven't checked, but we should make sure if hook output is only whitespace (newlines or tabs or spaces) we should skip that.

I think what we really want for this is a Git console, not a popup.

Git console is too much for that. Also console makes sense if one would be able to run commands there, etc. Only for output of some hooks? Also if we will have console activated on commit from staging view, it will be worse - we will loose the current context and to react on a hook we would need to switch back to staging view.
