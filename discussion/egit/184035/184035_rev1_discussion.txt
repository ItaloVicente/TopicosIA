DESCRIPTION:

[blame] Fix creating an enriched hover control

Pass the last hovered line number via the BlameRevision to ensure the
sticky hover uses the same line number as the initial non-sticky hover
even if the mouse moved in the meantime. Add the status text to the
initial unfocused hover. When made sticky, fill the empty toolbar, for
now just with two buttons for opening the commit and for showing it in
the history view. More actions can be added in later changes.

Outwit the framework when a hover is made sticky via F2. In that case
the framework imposes a fairly small maximum size on the hover. But
revision hovers frequently can be large and thus would get resized to
a much smaller size when F2 is used. To prevent that make the size
of the initial hover known to the sticky hover so that it can ensure
it gets at least the same size.

I noticed that the toolbar isn't shown immediately, only when moving the mouse pointer inside the pop-up window the toolbar appears.

Is it intended that the toolbar is at the bottom ? Took me a while to find it, first since it wasn't shown immediately and then I didn't expect it at the bottom.

Finding the drop-down menu on the hunk header isn't obvious.

Or when you hit F2. The pop-up is enriched when it is made sticky, which is when the mouse pointer enters it or you hit F2. That's standard behavior provided by the framework, as in the javadoc pop-ups in the Java editor.

> Is it intended that the toolbar is at the bottom ? Took me a while to find it, first since it wasn't shown immediately and then I didn't expect it at the bottom.

Yes. The location of the toolbar is chosen by the framework.

That's unchanged in this change; it's the normal HyperlinkDetector of the DiffViewer. When we added this HyperlinkDetector in the DiffViewer, we got this functionality for free also in the blame hovers.
