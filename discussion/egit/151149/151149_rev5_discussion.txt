DESCRIPTION:

[repo view] Let "link with selection" be always enabled

It's actually a normal state toggling command for which a default
handler is fine. It didn't have a default handler because it was badly
implemented and assumed that the currently active part was the
repositories view.

Change the handling of all three toggle commands in the repositories
view. Let them only toggle their state, don't make them refresh the
view. Make the view listen to state changes and refresh if needed.
The content provider doesn't need to listen to changes; it has no way
to inform the viewer to refresh.

Also remove duplicating the state into local boolean variables; use
the state's current value instead.

Nope, sorry. Needs a rework; there's something I don't understand.

Up to PS 3, clicking the button would make the view automatically show the currently selected element *in the previously active view*. And in fact, one test now actually tests for this and passes because it just changes the state, but doesn't click the button anymore.

But the code cannot work. The active part when that command is fired through clicking the button is the repo view itself. And indeed when I manually click the button, the view does not follow the selection! It can't, since the active part is already the view itself. if we'd want that behavior, we'd have to track the "previously current" selection through a PartListener.

So it looks like I at least I should change the tests back to actually clicking the button. And the view will react only when the user then activates some other part.
