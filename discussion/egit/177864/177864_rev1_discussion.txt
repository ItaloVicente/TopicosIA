DESCRIPTION:

Ensure nested git repositories are picked up

EGit already detected .git resources inside newly connected Eclipse
projects and touched them to force a ResourceChangeEvent containing
them in the delta so that GitDataProvider could connect the submodules.

However, that didn't always work. First, the corresponding code was
sometimes not called (for instance, when auto-sharing a project), and
second, it didn't work for nested repositories. Touching a folder does
not include it in the next resource delta.

Looks like the Eclipse resource tree is similar in that respect to git
and only handles files as expected.

Instead of touching ".git" folders, touch the HEAD file inside, if it
exists. If not, the directory isn't a git-directory anyway.

Line:174, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/ConnectProviderOperation.java -> I have no IDE right now, don't see when refreshResources is set to true, but I wonder if the following refreshLocal() code is needed only if that is true, not if we touched the .git only.
An *additional* refresh just because we discovered .git is not OK. In our case the real project consists of ~200.000 and up files, so an extra refresh can cost a lot, especially on NFS.

Line:214, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/ConnectProviderOperation.java -> Just a matter of style: AtomicBoolean is better suitable for such flags, it is easier to read/understand.

Line:174, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/ConnectProviderOperation.java -> _You_ introduced that "refreshResources" flag a long time ago :-). It's normally true; false only for auto-sharing. But when auto-sharing and the resource proxy visitor (it's using resource proxies exactly for speed) did find such nested .git items, then we _must_ refresh. 200k+ files or no. (But the delta should be small and be only the just touched .git resources in this case, as importing does a full refresh anyway.)

Or maybe we could not touch and trigger GitProjectData.update() through new API directly with the .git items found by the visitor.

Let Simeon verify first that this solves the problem; then we can try to refactor to avoid touch-and-refresh.

Line:214, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/ConnectProviderOperation.java -> I disagree. AtomicBoolean should be reserved for cases where actual concurrency is involved.

Done anyway as it leads to clearer code.
