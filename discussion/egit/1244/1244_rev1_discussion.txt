DESCRIPTION:

Hard-wrap commit message to 70 characters

When the user presses "Commit", the commit message is hard-wrapped to
70 characters. Existing newlines are not touched, to allow for manual
formatting.

The editor shows the commit message in a monospace font and the width
is fixed to 70 characters. This way, what the user sees should be what
the user gets when we later hard-wrap the commit message.

Having an *option* to reflow the text automatically would be nice.

I'd prefer a persistent setting in the commit dialog. Maybe one
for using a fixed-width font too?

Btw. See the history viewer for how I handled the wrapping of the text while displaying it. I.e. I don't let the reflow happen anywhere, but use sime hints to preserve ascii graphics
and things like that. (actually needs some improvements since the viewer displays tha patch too for which the wrapping makes less sence.

A agree having too many options at once may be a problem. We could hidet them as some do with an Advanced option than opens up only when asked for.

I also dislike going into a dialog doing some work and then figure I have to cancel and go to another dialog, especially when I lose work, i.e. my so-far-written commit message and the staging done so far.

Robin, we should not clutter the Commit dialog with too many things. As of now, we already have so many options in the commit dialog that commiting is more than a no-brainer. I think this should go to the preference page (same would be for print margin and font). But we may want to provide a link to the pref page in the dialog to quickly access the available options.

This is more a proof of concept to start a discussion rather than a final implementation. It should probably be configurable, for one.

Should the option be in the preferences or as another checkbox in the commit dialog?
