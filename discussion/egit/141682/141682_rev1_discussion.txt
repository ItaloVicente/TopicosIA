Just to be sure that I understood the formal requirements correctly:

The two CQs are for JGit, not for EGit. This just adapts the EGit target platforms such that one can have both EGit and JGit in the same workspace. EGit does not include sshd in its repository, it gets included in the EGit update site because we re-distribute the JGit features. Using and redistributing another Eclipse project doesn't need a CQ. So this change would not be required to mention the CQs, and we don't need separate CQs for EGit either.

Is that correct? If not, then why don't we need CQs for EGit?

I think this is correct, I will remove the CQ links here since we just redistribute jgit to make both development and installation simpler

> Build Successful

Whoa! I hadn't thought this through, and was initially surprised to see this build succeed, but that shows two things:

1. Our hiding the upstream sshd interface in JGit was successful.
2. Indeed EGit does not include sshd in the repo: it contains sshd 2.0.0 from the JGit feature.

The change shouldn't be committed before the JGit change and before a new JGit has been built, though. Otherwise people fetching EGit and having a sshd-2.0.0-based JGit in their workspace will end up with lots of compilation errors.
