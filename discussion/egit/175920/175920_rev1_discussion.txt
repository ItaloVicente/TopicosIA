DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564708 - Migrate Jobs to DS

The template resolver and the configuration checker in the Activator
needs to be started when the EGit bundle is started, but does not need
to be done in the Activator itself.  By externalising this as a DS
component, it will be started when the bundle starts but asynchronously
from the Activator content, thus will reduce the amount of time required
to start EGit.

Moving these to Jobs and enabling them as components allows them to be
independently controlled, and terminated when the bundle or component is
stopped.

This is an earlier attempt (not up-to-date) of moving the individual parts for the setup jobs into the a component:

https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/egit/egit/+/175913

However, it might be wiser to move away from jobs completely as separate components, and just use them into the setup job in 175913 instead.

Yes, looks like these two could be done in the StartEventListener, and don't need to be jobs. Hmmm... on what thread is EventHandler.handleEvent() called when listening for the UI event APP_STARTUP_COMPLETE? We might end up doing too much on the UI thread...

I notice there's even another change from Michael Keppler also trying to use OSGi DS: https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/egit/egit/+/158385 There you mentioned something about avoiding "hitting the E4 events". Is there a problem with them?
