DESCRIPTION:

[repo groups] inline renaming of repository groups

Set up editing support in the repositories view, triggered
programmatically via the RenameRepositoryGroup handler.

Pasting proved to be a problem since the view already has a paste
command, which "stole" the paste and always handled it. Thus pasting
into an open cell editor was not possible.

JFace does have some support for overriding edit _actions_ when a
cell editor is active, but I haven't found anything similar for
commands. In the end I settled for making the PasteCommand simply
call the view first to give it a chance to forward the paste to the
cell editor.
