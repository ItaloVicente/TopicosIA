DESCRIPTION:

[repo groups] inline renaming of repository groups

Set up editing support in the repositories view, triggered
programmatically via the RenameRepositoryGroup handler. Fix
the RepositoriesViewSorter to actually consider the categories,
and ensure repository groups are at the bottom.

Fix equals(), hashCode(), and compareTo() for RepositoryGroupNodes:
these should store the RepositoryGroup, not the label as their object.
Remove the then superfluous getGoup() method; use getObject() instead.
equals() must compare the repo groups. compareTo() is used only for
sorting, so it may compare by group name.

Fix the label provider: the workbench adapter must return a label
text, which is the group's name.

Also eliminate the default handler for PasteCommand by tying the
handler to the standard org.eclipse.ui.edit.paste command.

Pasting proved to be a problem since the view registered a default
handler for the paste command, which "stole" the paste and always
handled it. Thus pasting into an open cell editor was not possible.

JFace does have some support for overriding edit _actions_ when a
cell editor is active, but I haven't found anything similar for
commands. In the end I settled for making the PasteCommand simply
call the view first to give it a chance to forward the paste to the
cell editor.

Besides my forgetting to update the test I broke something else. The rename per se works, but there's something mighty strange going on between the staging view and the repo view. The staging view creates a RepositoryNode for its title, and nulls that node out via clear() when it no longer needs it. But somehow that very node instance ends up replacing the different instance in the repo view tree?!

So as long as one only selects repositories in the repo view (with staging set to follow the selection) everything's fine. But as soon as one selects a repo group, the staging view gets a null repo, discards and clears its title node, and since that same instance somehow is also referenced in the repo view's tree, we now have a repo node with a null repo in the repo view, wich leads to numerous problems.

Investigating how that staging view RepositoryNode ends up being in the repo view tree, but that may take some time.

Line:586, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> I was wondering if this should be extracted to a dedicated RepositoriesViewTextCellEditor class, in particular as allowing more inline editing use cases are considered.
