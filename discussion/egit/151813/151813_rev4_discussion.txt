DESCRIPTION:

[repo groups] inline renaming of repository groups

Set up editing support in the repositories view, triggered
programmatically via the RenameRepositoryGroup handler. Fix
the RepositoriesViewSorter to actually consider the categories,
and place repository groups at the top.

Fix equals(), hashcode(), and compareTo() for RepositoryGroupNodes:
these should store the RepositoryGroup, not the label as their object.
Remove the then superfluous getGoup() method; use getObject() instead.
equals() must compare the repo groups. compareTo() is used only for
sorting, so it may compare by group name.

Fix the label provider: the workbench adapter must return a label
text, which is the group's name.

Remove an unnecessary error message; it's no longer used and the
handler for the command is active anyway only if exactly one repo
group is selected.

Changing RepositoryGroupNode should definitely be done! Note that the javadoc for RepositoryTreeNode#getObject has to be adapted as well.

Sorry, that I am not immediately ecstatic about the inline renaming. The reason is not that the feature itself is not nice. It is just that a) currently it is not consistent with the other renaming actions in the view - they all open a dialog, b) the validation is implemented in two places - and you always have to think of both of them in case of changes.

Is there a plan for changing renaming a branch inline as well? The different modes may not be intuitive to the user.
If the inline renaming should win, how about creating a group with a default name and immediately invoke the rename command (or with an empty name and deleting it if renaming is aborted). This way, there would not be two different versions for defining a group name.
Line:50, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoriesViewSorter.java -> Technically, wouldn't it make sense to change the position of REPOGROUP in the enum definition?

I intentionally put the groups after the repositories without a group (without claiming that my reasoning is correct, just that a decision must be made, I can live with both versions).
The primary concept of the Repositories View is the repository which is why I would show it first. I can think of different ways groups can be used. The one I had in mind is leaving the few current focus repositories without a group and put the rest in an attic group (which I would like to be at the end). And if all repositories are placed in groups, there is no problem. If a new repository is added, it appears on top and can be moved to a group.
From a workflow perspective to me it simply seems more natural that groups come last.

From a file/folder interpretation groups are like folders and are expected to come first...

Line:18, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryGroupNode.java -> Yes, much better making more sense and making the additional API redundant.

Line:197, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryTreeNode.java -> I am just wondering if the equal-hashcode-correspondence is broken now. Equals basically delegates to RepositoryGroup#equals which is not implemented while hashCode   is implemented here.

Line:272, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryTreeNode.java -> See hashCode comment.

Line:35, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/RenameRepositoryGroupCommand.java -> In case inline renaming makes it, the static CreateRepositoryGroupCommand#getNewGroupName should not be exposed anymore as it is not used elsewhere.

Line:53, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/RenameRepositoryGroupCommand.java -> I understand why you eliminate the exception. I often use this pattern (without localized exception messages) not as information for the user but for the programmer.
There is no guarantee that the command is only invoked via the plugin.xml definitions and there is no guarantee that the enablement definition is not changed at some point.

There is a difference between a NOOP in case some precondition is not met and an actual implementation error. Here I wanted to make explicit that the command must not be invoked on an illegal selection.

I know about (a) and (b). But both would need to be done in follow-up changes.

I thought about it, and at least for renaming on a Ref node it could be easily done -- except that the current dialog also offers content assist (when the user enters invalid characters. So we'd need to have a way to display an error message and the content assist without having them overlap...

For renaming the currently checked out branch when invoked on the repo node itself we still would need the dialog. But I think a user would understand that, since in that case it's _not_ the selected object that is to be renamed.

Yes, for creation I had that idea, too. But that would be a follow-up change.

I don't think so. Actually I think using the enum order as display order is a hack. View representation should be independent of enum order.

 > I intentionally put the groups after the repositories

With the idea you describe that makes sense. Easy to change here. OK, let's leave them at the end.

Line:197, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/RepositoryTreeNode.java -> Not really. But one could equally well use group.hashCode() directly. There is exactly one Java RepositoryGroup object for a given group UUID. Actually, the UUIDs are currently an unneeded level of indirection. But I didn't want to change that; might come in handy if we ever do nested groups.

For consistency, I think I should call group.hashCode() here.
