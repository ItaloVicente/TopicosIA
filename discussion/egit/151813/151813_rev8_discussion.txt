DESCRIPTION:

[repo groups] inline renaming of repository groups

Set up editing support in the repositories view, triggered
programmatically via the RenameRepositoryGroup handler. Fix
the RepositoriesViewSorter to actually consider the categories,
and ensure repository groups are at the bottom.

Fix equals(), hashCode(), and compareTo() for RepositoryGroupNodes:
these should store the RepositoryGroup, not the label as their object.
Remove the then superfluous getGoup() method; use getObject() instead.
equals() must compare the repo groups. compareTo() is used only for
sorting, so it may compare by group name.

Fix the label provider: the workbench adapter must return a label
text, which is the group's name.

Also eliminate the default handler for PasteCommand by tying the
handler to the standard org.eclipse.ui.edit.paste command.

Pasting proved to be a problem since the view registered a default
handler for the paste command, which "stole" the paste and always
handled it. Thus pasting into an open cell editor was not possible.

JFace does have some support for overriding edit _actions_ when a
cell editor is active, but I haven't found anything similar for
commands. In the end I settled for making the PasteCommand simply
call the view first to give it a chance to forward the paste to the
cell editor.

> ... I broke something else.

Not really; turns out that was bug 552622 present already before repo groups were introduced. Repo groups just made it much easier to hit this bug. Fixed through the rebase.

Unrelated unstable test failure. "Normal". I'll re-trigger later.

Line:599, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> I still think that the actual editing and validation logic justifies a separate class - if only a configurator class returing the textCell editor.
If inline editing for other nodes is added, there will have to be if-elses in many of the methods. The setupInlineEditing method will become much longer.

Line:599, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> I would do that later. Ever heard about YAGNI? I'm not going to design a "general" interface for setting this up now while I have only one use case. Once the second use case is implemented we'll see much clearer what the commonalities are and what exactly would make sense to factor out.

Note that there is only _one_ TextCellEditor for the column. We'd have to handle the different cases in the validator and in the modifier.

Line:599, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> OK. I was rather thinking of something like RepositoriesViewInlineEditorFactory with a static TextCellEditor createAndBindEditor(CommonViewer viewer) method. I was concerned about the amount of code for a special case that might easily be externalized...
