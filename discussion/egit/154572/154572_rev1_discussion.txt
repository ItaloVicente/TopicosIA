DESCRIPTION:

Staging View: fix title label updates

Since the label provider/decorator setup changes in commit b2e98cd3
the staging view title could flicker between undecorated and decorated
label. DecoratingStyledCellLabelProvider.getStyledText() has no
protection for decorations being pending, so it mustn't be used
anymore to determine the view's title.

Instead use a simple DecoratingLabelProvider. Use it to update a
ViewerLabel object on any LabelProviderChangedEvent, and update the
form title only if that ViewerLabel has a new image or text. The
label provider's updateLabel() method has similar protection for
pending decorations, and so the flickering can be avoided.

Also use this ViewerLabel to set the form title image; this gives
the staging view the correct image (for instance, the "Gerrit repo"
image for Gerrit-enabled repositories).

I've only been testing this from a development IDE (i.e. not in the same IDE I reported the bug for).

The fix looks incomplete. Close the git staging view. Then re-open it. The first label is always shown as "repo", only after a short delay the decoration is added. When switching to some other repos, this also happens during the first some seconds after opening the git staging view, but not anymore afterwards. By re-opening the git staging view, I can provoke the undecorated label in the same session again.

That delay is nothing new. Start an Eclipse with EGit 5.6.0 or 5.5.1 and click through the repositories in the repo view. First time you also see that delay until the decoration appears. Also when you close and re-open the view; then you'll see that delay again.

Thereafter one didn't see it anymore because of that "adding a blank" hack. If we want to avoid it on later switches, we'll have to keep a map of ViewerLabels and unconditionally re-use the old label before calling updateTitle again.
