File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This is really a pity. But apparently nobody cared enough to keep Mylyn alive.

We should also change the EGit builds to not trigger the egit-github builds anymore.
And the mylyn bundles there also should go.

What do we do with org.eclipse.egit.github.core? With Eclipse TLP having moved to Github, it might make sense to keep that one alive.

-1 because of the partial revert in the oomph setup.
Line:141, tools/oomph/EGit.setup -> Somehow this undoes the change I had made for 6.3.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Do we have to do something for users who have installed EGit 6.1 or 6.2 including the egit-mylyn feature on an Eclipse where Mylyn is present, so that an update to EGit 6.3 will work seamlessly?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I'd say go with the simpler way: leave it there, just remove the Mylyn stuff in egit-github. After all, sometimes projects do get revived (like BIRT, or GEF classic).

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Yes, so many years went into its development and now it's abandoned. If someone revives Mylyn we can revert this deletion.

Yes we should also delete the egit-github builds.

I plan to move org.eclipse.egit.github.core and its tests to the EGit repository.
Question is with or without its history ?

We can then archive the egit-github repo.

I didn't intend to revert your oomph setup update. I created this change earlier and didn't spot this when rebasing it on current master. Should be fixed now.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I guess we should add some p2.inf magic to uninstall old versions of this feature when updating to egit 6.2 or newer. I wagely remember we did something like this in the past when the smart import was merged into the egit.ui bundle

That was my initial idea, too. But getting it over with history would be a nightmare. You'd first have to excise all commits not touching it from the git history.

On second thought, this is not necessary. If we remove all the Mylyn-dependent bundles from egit-github, then org.eclipse.egit.github.core can remain there. It has no dependencies on EGit, so building it and even consuming it in EGit for whatever great Github improvements people have in mind should then be no trouble.

(It's also a bit special insofar as it still has BREE Java 1.8 for Android compatibility.)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> We could use git-filter-repo [1] to extract the history (which would be rewritten by this surgery) of org.eclipse.egit.github.core and org.eclipse.egit.github.core.test, push that to the egit repo (direct push without review) as an independent second version graph and then merge it into the egit repo's master branch.

Of course instead we can leave it in the egit-github repo and delete all the mylyn related stuff there.

Advantage of the first approach is one less repo to maintain, advantage of the second approach is it's easier and easier to revert in case mylyn is revived.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Exactly. We'll have to test. IIRC the trick was to make some other bundle/IU claim it also provided a new version of the removed IUs.
