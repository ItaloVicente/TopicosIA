I've also not seen any authoritative writing. However, I would use "Gitflow" for a different reason: Simplicity. When using one word, it seems pretty obvious how to write it (GitFlow doesn't really come that natural). When using two words, uuhm, was it Git Flow, Git flow, Git-flow, or Git-Flow?

From a grammar point of view, Gitflow would also be fine, because it can be assumed to be a name.

That being said, I can probably live with all versions. :)
