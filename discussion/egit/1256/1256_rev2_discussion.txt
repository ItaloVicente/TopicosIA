DESCRIPTION:

Git History View: use system-specific line separator in clipboard

Currently, "\n" is always used when copying several entries from
the history view commits or the file list into the clipboard.
The system specific line separator should be used, though.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

This is fine. We should probably have a constant somewhere for this... calling System.getProperties everywhere seems a bit much. I believe we have something available in the Eclipse platform but I can't remember atm.
