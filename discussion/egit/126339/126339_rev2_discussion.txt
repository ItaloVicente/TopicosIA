Thomas, I've applied your changes and removed the additional grouping composite to avoid that its spacing and margin get relevant.

Additionally I've removed the margin that was previously around the commit buttons and the committer/author fields. Previously the "A" of "Author" and the end of the author input field where not in line with the left and right border of the commit message field, but now they are (at least on my Windows system).

Looks very good. Maybe reduce the vertical gap above the commit buttons a little? But we can also merge as is.

And maybe reduce the horizontal spacing between icon, label, and text fields a little? 5px eat up quite a bit of space. 2px might be sufficient. But again, for me it's fine as is.
