Patch 7 is based on patch 5. I added the proposed property tester to the single repository switch case. If a group with a single repository is selected, the menu for single repositories is shown (with other submenu elements). I hope, this does not cause confusion ("But I selected a group!?"). If the group is not expanded, the label still indicates that it contains only a single repository.

If the parent "switch to" item was a dynamic contribution itself, you would have control over the label, wouldn't you?

I find the dialog slightly confusing. Initially with an empty branch name field, it shows a random repository name followed by an error message due to the validator. I understand that this is necessary e.g. if a branch name already exists in one of the repositories. But for empty input I would rather suppress showing the validation. I really couldn't even understand that message first, since by chance it had selected my "gitflow" repository, and I read the message as something coming from the gitflow egit plugin. :)

Can we eventually reword the dialog message above the input field? It doesn't say anywhere that the user shall enter the new branch name. When comparing with the single repo dialog, it says that much more clearly. E.g. "Input branch name to be created from the head of all selected repositories:" might fix that.
