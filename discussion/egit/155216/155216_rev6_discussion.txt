I am not sure about the change in the property tester. This particular property is used only for the switch menu. The justification for claiming that a selected group counts as multiple repositories is that  a group generally represents multiple repositories. An or-branch in the plugin.xml would be possible as well.

... Why can't the SwitchMenu determine its own label? Basically, 30 lines of plugin.xml code are duplicated just to add "Repositories" to the label...

I'd leave the property tester unchanged. See plugin.xml, PS 5, for my suggestion for a simple fix.

 > ... Why can't the SwitchMenu determine its own label?

If you know a way by which a dynamic sub-menu can programmatically change the label of the parent's MenuItem: feel free to change this. We did it that way because we hadn't found a way to do so. There is IElementUpdater, but that's only for handlers, not for dynamic contributions?
Line:82, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/selection/SelectionPropertyTester.java -> Is wrong for a group with only one repo.
