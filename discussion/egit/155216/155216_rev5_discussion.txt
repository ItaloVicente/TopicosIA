There's a problem with the GitRepositories.isBare property tester (RepositoriesViewPropertyTester). The plugin.xml uses

  <test property="GitRepository.isBare" value="false" />

but that matches unless _all_ repos in the group are bare. If there's one non-bare repo in the group, the <test> will succeed and the command will be called with bare repos. Looks like this tester now needs an additional (optional) parameter for the operator ("or" or "and"), and here it should be "or".

As far as I can see, all isBare checks in the plugin.xml are against value=false. In almost all cases there is an additional count test (almost always 1).
I agree that there is an issue. But shouldn't it be dealt with separately? In which cases (for SwitchToMenu) do we have a problem?

* Only if more than one repo is involved (otherwise the property tester works as expected).
* Create new Branch? No, because of canBulkCreateNewBranch!

This leaves switching the branch to one of the common branches, but with respect to this feature, nothing changed at all.

I could let createMostActiveBranches create nothing if one if the repositories is bare. In this case, we'd run into createDisabledMenu which is correct. And as a user, I would not complain about the SwitchToMenu still being shown!

Anyway, I'd prefer a separate property "isAnyBare" to an additional optional parameter. I think this would be more readable both in the plugin.xml and the property tester class.

This shows both %SwitchToMenuMultiple and %SwitchToMenu if a single repo group containing more than one repo is selected.
Line:170, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SwitchToMenu.java -> Probably the check for SAFE would be better.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:4190, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Instead of removing this and changing the propertytester, I think just adding here (after the </iterate>)

  <test property="GitSelection.selectionMultipleRepositories" value="false" />

would do the trick.
