DESCRIPTION:

Workaround for empty staging viewer after selection

Since the underlying SWT issue has been discussed since 2014 and we have
not found a real fix, have a workaround in egit instead.

On Windows add the missing redraw in the selection listener explicitly.
Users may notice a minor flickering on selection. However, that is
surely better than not seeing all the unselected elements at all. And
the flickering also exists on the first element, when NOT applying this
workaround.

Of course. I was so focused on your reproduction steps, I completely ignored everything else afterwards. My fault.

Michael, could you try if reskin(SWT.ALL) also helps (instead of redraw())? Don't know if it does or if it might make a difference regarding the flickering. But if it helps, it's one more pointer toward a bug in E4 themeing.

reskin() doesn't help.

I also tried several variants of refresh() and update() directly on the viewer. However, those all finally skip updating widgets which already have the same label and image.

I also checked widget.getData(...) to see if one of the flags (needsRefresh and similar) mentioned in the very old bug reports from 2014 is set at our tree, but there is nothing.

The only other crazy workaround I have come up with is adding/removing a blank at the end of each entry whenever a refresh is needed (remember your decorator?). But I don't really want to do that...

OK. I wonder if it has something to do with the viewer being inside a form, and nested in two sashes...

It works now. Just wondering, how people could work on Windows with this bug?

Depends a lot on your personal workflow. I've seen this like every some months only, due to using the staging view only when I'm done, and then staging everything. Also I assumed this to be an "out of Windows handles" issue when working with a lot of Eclipse instances at the same time.
