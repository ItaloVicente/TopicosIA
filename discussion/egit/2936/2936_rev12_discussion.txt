DESCRIPTION:

Team project set support

This is based on the previous work by Mykola Nikishov in change
I800dd9f23953ad903f20289c442707e2dde08f75 ("Import a project set file").
This change includes export support, unit tests, and can handle the
situation where different branches of the same repository should be
imported.

A project reference string in the project set file looks like this:

  1.0,git://egit.eclipse.org/egit.git,master,org.eclipse.egit

Based on an array of these reference strings, GitProjectSetCapability
does the following when importing:

- Clone a repository with CloneOperation for each combination of
  repository URL and branch name.
- Import a project from each directory that is specified in the last
  part of the string ("." if the repository itself is the .project).
- Add the repository to the Repositories View.
- Connect the projects using ConnectProviderOperation.

Due to Bug 244313, import and export of project set files requires the
org.eclipse.core.runtime.compatibility plug-in. The dependency is in a
separate optional feature, as proposed on the old change. It's required
for Eclipse < 3.7.

Patch Set 12: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I tried rebasing this to current master but then project set export doesn't work anymore, it's then always exporting (using Indigo workbench) :

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<psf version="2.0">
<provider id="org.eclipse.egit.core.GitProvider"/>
</psf>

without rebasing it works fine. I couldn't spot the reason. Could you rebase and fix this problem then I will start IP review to get this change approved and will accept it. The remaining issues you listed in bug 296082 can be done in subsequent changes.

That's no problem. If it would be discarded, then i would have to write something own, now i just used it to spare my efforts (and to bring my other features into a runnable state).

Can you extract ProjectReference as separate class? I would need this for my work (or should i push a new patchset with my suggestions)?
