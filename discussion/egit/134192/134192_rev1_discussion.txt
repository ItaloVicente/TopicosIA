Register UI job only when workbench is available

In case the workbench is not available our job would starve and cause a
log message on shutdown.

As I said on the bug, I'm not convinced. The javadoc on IStartup says
clearly "Plug-ins that register a startup extension will be activated after the Workbench initializes", and on earlyStartup() "Will be called in a separate thread after the workbench initializes. Note that most workbench methods must be called in the UI thread since they may access SWT."

IStartup is a UI concept, and EASE should simply not call IStartups when it doesn't initialize a Workbench at all because it wants to do headless things. EASE is violating the contract by calling IStartups before a Workbench is initialized.

Well, if you are not going to accept the patch then you have to abandon it and close the bug as wontfix.

Still IStartup is the only way to automate things when  - actually eclipse - starts. Typically this is the workbench. We do have users that rely on services getting started by that extension, hence the request that EASE runs them. I agree that this is not ideal regarding the initial concept behind IStartup.
On the other hand I cannot tell users that some projects are violating a basic eclipse concept and therefore EASE does not support them. We use a pragmatic approach to solve a real world problem.

Regarding the proposed patch I thought it would be trivial and do no harm to the EGit project. Only other option would be to disable the EGit Startup by using preferences. Would Egit still work correctly then? (Also in 'full UI' mode?)

Compare bug 50164. IStartup is a UI concept, loading and calling it will typically also activate the bundle containing it (BundleActivationPolicy: lazy), and the Activator may try to do more UI things (mylyn.team.ui and mylyn.tasks.ui, to name just two). Since you want a headless setup calling IStartup just doesn't feel right, and adding tests in IStartup that check that the workbench is running when the contract already promises that it is doesn't feel right either.
