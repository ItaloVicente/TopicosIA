DESCRIPTION:

Git Repositories View: Hierarchical branches representation toggle

Similar to the package explorer which supports flat vs. hierarchical
package representation, this allows to toggle between flat vs. hierarchical
branch representation. If the toggle is on, then the "/" used in the
branch names is interpreted as hierarchy separator and the branches are
presented correspondingly.
Other than the suggestion in bug 315567, this does not eliminate the
"Remote Branches" node altogether in "hierarchical" mode, since
there might be remote branches without "/" separators
which would result in a confusing representation.

Bug: 315567
Bug: 323950
