DESCRIPTION:

Start RepositoryChangeScanner after workbench initialized

Without this change, the egit.ui.Activator.start takes about 500ms on my
Windows machine, with more than 90% of the runtime attributed to the
setupRepositoryChangeScanner method (which triggers egit.core
activation, preferences initialization and some other things).

With this change, the egit.ui activator takes less than 50ms, and
egit.core is no longer activated from egit.ui, but from the extension
registry.

Interestingly, the runtime of the setupRepositoryChangeScanner
(previously 450 ms) drops down to less than 10ms, because all the class
initializations and class loadings formerly caused by egit.ui are now
caused by other parts of the workbench. I cannot yet say where the code
is triggered now, and I also cannot judge whether the workbench comes up
faster overall. However, it would be nice if someone following the
tracing approach could post comparisons with/without this change.

Be aware that this change does NOT save 450ms magically (because egit.ui
activator is that much faster). It just doesn't contain egit.core
activation nested anymore. Still it might be useful to defer the
repository change scanner this way, since we probably can't do much with
its callbacks before the workbench is up.

Line:920, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/Activator.java -> Can we please add a NP check here? We have a headless application that unfortunately uses lot of xtext that initializes lot of UI bundles that in theory could trigger egit ui activation, all without proper workbench startup. I fear we may end with the case where this code is called without the service ever activated.

Oops. Sorry about that. I've disabled this job for now. I'm preparing better build jobs for after the release, and forgot that this one would be triggered. At least it worked perfectly :-)
