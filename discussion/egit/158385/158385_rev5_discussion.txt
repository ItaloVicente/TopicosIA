DESCRIPTION:

Start RepositoryChangeScanner after workbench initialized

Without this change, the egit.ui.Activator.start takes about 500ms on my
Windows machine, with more than 90% of the runtime attributed to the
setupRepositoryChangeScanner method (which triggers egit.core
activation, preferences initialization and some other things).

With this change, the egit.ui activator takes less than 50ms, and
egit.core is no longer activated from egit.ui, but from the extension
registry.

Interestingly, the runtime of the setupRepositoryChangeScanner
(previously 450 ms) drops down to less than 10ms, because all the class
initializations and class loadings formerly caused by egit.ui are now
caused by other parts of the workbench. I cannot yet say where the code
is triggered now, and I also cannot judge whether the workbench comes up
faster overall. However, it would be nice if someone following the
tracing approach could post comparisons with/without this change.

Be aware that this change does NOT save 450ms magically (because egit.ui
activator is that much faster). It just doesn't contain egit.core
activation nested anymore. Still it might be useful to defer the
repository change scanner this way, since we probably can't do much with
its callbacks before the workbench is up.

Matthias, is this intended to be merged *after* 5.7 release? 
If yes, +1 :-)

See e.g. https://git.eclipse.org/r/158972 where I've moved one of the jobs to be a DS component instead. I think we could move to this kind of model rather than hitting the E4 events, and make the code cleaner into the bargain.
