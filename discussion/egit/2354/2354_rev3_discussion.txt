Rebase this change on top of current master.

I'm afraid that we could have some issues connected with non-workspace resources.

I've create a separate change Id9a61b875d5302ed93587b4865f2d5dd78959181 for showing compare editor for non-workspace files.

Could you please rebase this change and push rebased version?

Dariusz, I'm a bit confused: which change set should be rebased on top of which? :) Seems my revision is now parent of yours. Or you want them to be completely separate - based on master?

Dariusz, you're right, the patch doesn't solve all problems, but compare editor for non-workspace files is a bit different story. The bug report was that we can't use Sync View at all (it's always empty). And with patch we can compare files those are inside of project (I think most common usecase). I will go on working to fix compare for non-workspace files, this is ofcorse also important, but can it be a different patch? We want to start using EGit in production and this fix is critical.
