This is a follow up change to the compact outline tree feature. A review can already been done but a merge should wait for the decision on the compact tree.

I am unsure about the context for the keybinding (if it is OK/correct and what to do if it is not). At least for me, the keybinding worked as expected.

Nice. Dialog appears in the middle of the screen; should appear in the middle of the editor area. Filter should support CamelCase and wildcards like in JDT Quick Outline.

Global window-wide context makes me nervous. Can't we have a context specific for the DiffEditor, or perhaps for the DiffViewer? Having it on the DiffViewer might perhaps make it easy to have this also in the history view...

Any reason why this has to be a static inner class? Can't we extract this into its own top-level class? Also, there's a TODO in that xtext code (relating to the user hitting return). Should be resolved.

Is there really no platform support for this? I'm a bit surprised to see JDT, Xtext, Mylyn, PDE, ..., and now EGit all re-implement this.

I'll give it a try (or rather adapt the corresponding method from Xtext).

Yes, it is quick and dirty at the moment. I'll see if I can find code to copy.

That's what I meant with I don't know how to fix the context part. I assume there is no existing DiffViewer context, I can simply use.

My intention was to do as little refactoring as possible (because it is a follow-up and I have little experience with conflicts so far). It is pure luck that delegating to the existing OutlinePage worked so *well*. I'd like to clean up the (straight-forward) funcitonal issues and do the refactoring afterwards.

I added that TODO because I am not sure about the desired behaviour.
* A folder could already be selected in the tree.
* A diff could be selected in the tree.
* There could be multiple matching diffs.
* There could be a single matching diff.
For two out of these four, it is not immediately obvious to me what should happen.

No there isn't. But shouldn't bee too difficult. Check the RepositoriesView. Is uses its own context and registers that with the IContextService obtained from the site. Additionally it uses a more local context that it activates/deactivates depending on what is selected.

Don't know off-hand where the DiffViewer would get the IContextService from; ideally it'd use the one from the site of the view or editor containing the viewer. If done for the Viewer, it might be necessary to activate/deactivate the context on focus events. If done for the DiffEditor, just registering with the IContextService obtained from the site should be fine.
