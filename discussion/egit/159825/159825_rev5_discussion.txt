On Mac the regular outline still doesn't follow. Not even when one clicks into the DiffEditor again. Occurs for the stand-alone editor and for the one embedded in the compare editor.
Line:36, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/DiffEditorOutlinePage.java -> Sorry, a dependency on JDT is a no go for EGit.

Line:731, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/DiffEditorOutlinePage.java -> This won't do. It logs PatternSyntaxExceptions. Just enter [ or \g.

> On Mac the regular outline still doesn't follow. 
This will be hard for me to track down without a system to reproduce the problem. I can imagine that it is caused by outline delegat-hack. I guess there is no way around the refactoring.
Line:36, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/DiffEditorOutlinePage.java -> I'll give it a try. I was looking for an easy way not to reimplement the camel case matching.

Line:36, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/DiffEditorOutlinePage.java -> Oh. There already was an optional dependency in the Manifest and without it Activator does not compile...

Line:731, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/DiffEditorOutlinePage.java -> I'll have a look at what you did for the tag matching ;-)

Line:36, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/DiffEditorOutlinePage.java -> Yes, we have that optional dependency (i.e., needed at compile time, but it'll work if not present at runtime). But here it would be required at run-time. Which means it'd fail for users using the Eclipse CDT package, which AFAIK doesn't include JDT at all.

SearchPattern does do CamelCase search. Should be as simple as

  SearchPattern matcher = new SearchPattern();
  matcher.setPattern(pattern);

and then using matcher.matches(). The class figures out from the pattern itself which kind of match to use. Regexps are not needed.

BTW converting a wildcard string into a regexp is not that trivial. Easiest way I know is to use \Q and \E to quote everything that is not an un-escaped * or ? and then remove all empty \Q\E pairs at the end, then compile the pattern. Regexps are also *slow*. See also bug 508611. But with SearchPattern I don't think we need regexps here at all.

In fact, I learned about SearchPattern from this code here, and it helped me avoid a dependency on the internal StringMatcher in org.eclipse.team in the tag filtering. :-)

The pattern code is adapted. I guess, if you are happy with the general setup, I'll have to have a go at the refactoring.
Line:36, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/DiffEditorOutlinePage.java -> Done
