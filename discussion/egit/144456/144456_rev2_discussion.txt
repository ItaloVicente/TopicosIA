DESCRIPTION:

BranchOperation: fix progress monitor handling

Usage of progress monitors was rather strange. Use the well-
established pattern for using SubMonitors that re-distributes
work locally within one method properly. It's much easier to
allocate ticks correctly that way.

Line:130, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/BranchOperation.java -> Should we also add a cancel check in this loop? I was recently wondering about that when I accidentially checked out an unwanted very branch and could not stop that operation for several minutes (where most of the time was probably spent in the check which projects to close).
However, we can do that in a separate change, if you agree.

Line:130, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/BranchOperation.java -> Good idea. But if you think most of the time was spent in getMissingProjects, we should also pass in a progress monitor there and cancel that. Though TreeWalks are surprisingly fast in my experience.

When there are several repositories, we should probably make sure that the combined result dialog shows the correct information (some repos done, one canceled, others not_attempted).
