DESCRIPTION:

[osgi] Disperse the EGit core Activator into OSGi dynamic services

Use OSGi DS to perform most of the setup formerly done in the Activator.
Because of interdependencies it's not possible to do this step-by-step.

The Activator did a number of unrelated things:

* setting up the internal EGit caches (RepositoryCache, IndexDiffCache,
  RepositoryUtil).
* setting up a number of IResourceChangeListeners for auto-sharing
  projects, auto-ignoring derived resources, and similar things.
* setting up HTTP and SSH, and proxy support.
* handling debug tracing options.
* migrating preferences.
* tracking merge strategies contributed via an extension point.

Each of these have now become an OSGi DS component:

* RepositoryInitializer: EGit caches
* WorkspaceConnector: IResourceChangeListeners
* TransportConfigurator: HTTP, SSH, and proxies
* DebugOptionsHandler: debug tracing options
* PreferencesMigrator: preferences migrations
* MergeStrategyTracker: merge strategy tracking

The activator is no longer the central hub from which other classes
can obtain the RepositoryCache, IndexDiffCache, or RepositoryUtil. This
change was necessary because otherwise an early component activation
causes the Activator to run, which then might cause trying to activate
org.eclipse.core.resources before the instance location is set, which
breaks Eclipse start-up.

These central singletons are newly managed in these three classes
directly, and are accessible via getInstance() static methods.

The RepositoryInitializer publishes the RepositoryCache as a service,
which is consumed by the WorkspaceConnector OSGi component. This
ensures correct initialization order.

The changes outside the Activator and the six new OSGi components are
all simple replacements for using the new instance getters instead of
the Activator.

> OK I've taken a walk through the changes and think I understand most of them; some commentary attached.

Thanks a lot; that's really helpful!

> * The IWorkspace is created quite early on in the startup of Eclipse's splash screen (probably in the first 10% or so). Moving the dependency on the IWorkspace in the OSGi component will pull the setup quite a lot earlier, so instead of taking time at the ~90% mark you'll find that the ~10% mark it's a bit slower. It will also (paradoxically) make the startup of the resources plugin longer, because when that publishes the IWorkspace, it will trigger components who were waiting on IWorkspace to run.

Correct, that's exactly what I'm observing.

> The above can be remediated somewhat if the 'heavy hitting' OSGi components use the same trick as the StartupInitializer component that was listening for the e4 event and/or Platform.isRunning() checks.

I would have to check, but I suppose most things need to be done before EGit UI starts doing its things. Or are you suggesting to use Jobs all the same? For the resource change listeners that might be another possibility, also for the preference migration and possibly the merge strategies stuff.

> * There's a few lazy-locking type steps

Not anymore.

> I understand that the issue with RepositoryUtil is that it won't exist until the location has been set, but perhaps another way of doing it is to have a RepositoryUtil that can set the location as a mutable field, and then have the implementations of (e.g.) 'contains' return null or 'getName' to be an empty string.

Instead relying now on the uses occurring late enough so that the workspace exists when the class is loaded. Seems to work. Hope I didn't miss something.
