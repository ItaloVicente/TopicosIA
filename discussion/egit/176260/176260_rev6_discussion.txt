DESCRIPTION:

[osgi] Disperse the EGit core Activator into OSGi dynamic services

Use OSGi DS to perform most of the setup formerly done in the Activator.
Because of interdependencies it's not possible to do this step-by-step.

The Activator did a number of unrelated things:

* setting up the internal EGit caches (RepositoryCache, IndexDiffCache,
  RepositoryUtil).
* setting up a number of IResourceChangeListeners for auto-sharing
  projects, auto-ignoring derived resources, and similar things.
* setting up HTTP and SSH, and proxy support.
* handling debug tracing options.
* migrating preferences.
* tracking merge strategies contributed via an extension point.

Each of these have now become an OSGi DS component:

* RepositoryInitializer: EGit caches
* WorkspaceConnector: IResourceChangeListeners
* TransportConfigurator: HTTP, SSH, and proxies
* DebugOptionsHandler: debug tracing options
* PreferencesMigrator: preferences migrations; runs as a Job
* MergeStrategies: merge strategy tracking; runs a Job to initialize

The activator is no longer the central hub from which other classes
can obtain the RepositoryCache, IndexDiffCache, or RepositoryUtil. This
change was necessary because otherwise an early component activation
causes the Activator to run, which then might cause trying to activate
org.eclipse.core.resources before the instance location is set, which
breaks Eclipse start-up.

These central singletons are newly managed in these three classes
directly, and are accessible via getInstance() static methods.

Likewise, the EGitSecureStore is now such a singleton that will be
created on first access to the EGitSecureStore class.

The RepositoryInitializer publishes the RepositoryCache as a service,
which is consumed by the WorkspaceConnector OSGi component. This
ensures correct initialization order.

The changes outside the Activator and the six new OSGi components are
all simple replacements for using the new instance getters instead of
the Activator.

should this wait for the next release or do you want to get this in for 5.11 ?

IMO this should go in early in the next release. While I'm confident it won't cause any problems, it's simply safer: if there are problems all the same, analyzing them will be easier with only one Activator (UI) changed in one release and the other in the next release. I see no reason to rush this.

It'll also give the EMF Compare team more time to detect possible problems with the asynchronous merge strategy loading, or to consider improving that extension point.

Or do you think that's overly cautious?

ok, then let's do this after 5.11

Sorry for the lack of response from our (EMF Compare) side. Thanks a lot for the heads up, we just haven't had any time to consider the changes here and how to enhance the extension point on our end. I'll try and look into this asap but don't think I'll have any chance to do so for 2021-03.

(Sorry, bit late on replying here)

I think waiting until after 5.11 is a good idea, in case there's additional changes that are required. It's a bit late in the sequence of the release to make a suite of changes like this.

Line:95, org.eclipse.egit.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> It didn't work in Icfcee3eeb27fe98a92566656c4b7b0c19cf088af for the EGit UI DebugOptionsListener, it got never called. Don't know why. Either I had made a mistake somewhere, or it was caused by the outer class having been the GitTraceLocation enum. Here it works, the Loader is activated and run.

FYI I've raised https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=571568 to discuss the problems with a DS component depending on the IWorkspace being activated on the same thread (and blocking) the ResourcesPlugin activator.

I've got a sample reproducer at https://github.com/alblue/ResourceHog which shows how a dependent plugin that does a lot of work (or simply loads a lot of classes) can cause delays to the start-up of Eclipse.

One suggestion is to move the publication of the service into its own (short-lived) thread instead of the Activator's start method, which would be an easy way of speeding up Eclipse's launch.

Which would change the game completely. We'd have to re-evaluate if what we're doing here is really correct. If we expect certain things to be done synchronously, how would we ensure that?
