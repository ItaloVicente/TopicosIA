DESCRIPTION:

[osgi] Disperse the EGit core Activator into OSGi dynamic services

Use OSGi DS to perform most of the setup formerly done in the Activator.
Because of interdependencies it's not possible to do this step-by-step.

The Activator did a number of unrelated things:

* setting up the internal EGit caches (RepositoryCache, IndexDiffCache,
  RepositoryUtil).
* setting up a number of IResourceChangeListeners for auto-sharing
  projects, auto-ignoring derived resources, and similar things.
* setting up HTTP and SSH, and proxy support.
* handling debug tracing options.
* migrating preferences.
* tracking merge strategies contributed via an extension point.

Each of these have now become an OSGi DS component:

* RepositoryInitializer: EGit caches
* WorkspaceConnector: IResourceChangeListeners
* TransportConfigurator: HTTP, SSH, and proxies
* DebugOptionsHandler: debug tracing options
* PreferencesMigrator: preferences migrations; runs as a Job
* MergeStrategies: merge strategy tracking; runs a Job to initialize

The activator is no longer the central hub from which other classes
can obtain the RepositoryCache, IndexDiffCache, or RepositoryUtil. This
change was necessary because otherwise an early component activation
causes the Activator to run, which then might cause trying to activate
org.eclipse.core.resources before the instance location is set, which
breaks Eclipse start-up.

These central singletons are newly managed in these three classes
directly, and are accessible via getInstance() static methods.

Likewise, the EGitSecureStore is now such a singleton that will be
created on first access to the EGitSecureStore class.

The RepositoryInitializer publishes the RepositoryCache as a service,
which is consumed by the WorkspaceConnector OSGi component. This
ensures correct initialization order.

The changes outside the Activator and the six new OSGi components are
all simple replacements for using the new instance getters instead of
the Activator.

Refactored this merge strategy business. Now in class MergeStrategies; still with a job as OSGi component to load. If merge strategies are requested before the job has initialized the strategies, empty results are returned. Removed the remnants of this merge strategy business from the Activator; now also in class MergeStrategies.

Still not happy with that extension point for merge strategies, but at least it's completely outside of the Activator now.

The Activator now only does some very basic but very important JGit setup that has to happen very early on, and provides logging utilities.

Perhaps this logging business could also be done differently, but that's for a later change. It would incur changes all over the place.
