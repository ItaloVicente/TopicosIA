DESCRIPTION:

Git history page: select commit after commits history is available

UI tried to select a commit immediately after scheduling
GenerateHistoryJob in GitHistoryPage.inputSet(). Since the job locks the
"loadedCommits" object, any call to CommitGraphTable.initCommitsMap()
causes UI wait on "synchronized (allCommits)" lock.

To avoid this, trigger selection task after the job is executed, if it
was executed at all.

This should finally work and do not disturb scrolling. Looks like we start the same job multiple times?

Doesn't follow branch or tag selections in the repo shown anymore.
Line:1918, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Strange formatting.

Line:1923, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> I see some incremental loading in the GenerateHistoryJob. How would this interact with newly using a JobChangeAdapter?

I guess it was previously frequently a no-op when a job got scheduled since it only waited on the synchronized block, but the generateHistoryJob updates the UI only at the end. I must confess the purpose of the incremental loading is then a bit unclear to me...

Line:1950, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> These choices are actually mutually exclusive, and if none of them is true, we don't even need the whole JobChangeAdapter.

Line:2715, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Why the local variable "old"? Either we're accessing this "job" variable only in the UI thread and then simply using "job" is fine, or we don't and then we also need to use "old.cancel()".

Line:2726, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Another thought: I think the JobChangeAdapter would need to be set on the job before the job gets scheduled. Otherwise it might theoretically be possible that the job is already finished before the listener is added, and then the listener would never be called.

Also, I'm not quite sure about the order in which things ought to be happening. GenereateHistoryJob.updateUI() calls back to showCommitList() here, which runs an asyncExec(). So does the listener, but newly _after_ showCommitList().

Looks like this needs careful thought. showCommitList() is called _only_ by the job's updateUI(). Maybe we'll have to do the showHead/showTag/etc stuff in showCommitList() if we do schedule a new job, _and_ in inputSet() if we don't.

I'll look at it when I have the time. I have no repository with which I could reproduce the 8-second block you experience, so I will have to rely on you for testing. Unless you could make that 15G repo available to me... but as it's not public, that would probably need a full-blown contract between the owner and my employer for fixing this, with non-disclosure agreements, pricing, and everything. Much easier if you were available to test my changes against that repo.

But going back to your stack trace at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=485743#c17 I do not understand how you ended up concluding that this showHead/showTag/etc was the culprit. The block shown in the stack trace is _inside_ the asyncExec() within showCommitList(). Probably that asyncExec() executes concurrently with the next run of the GenerateHistoryJob, and gets blocked there. That wouldn't be fixed by this change anyway.
