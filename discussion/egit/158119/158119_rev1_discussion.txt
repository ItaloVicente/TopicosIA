This is a first attempt to make the Push To Upstream label dynamic. I left the orignial menu item in place for now (for comparing visibility and enablement).

Feedback as to the actual format of the label would be very welcome:
* remote name
* push-URIs (what if there are many?)
* pushRefSpecs (what if there are many?)

One problem is that the width of the repositories view context menu is not reduced again, even if the push item is not shown in the end (may be caused by getContributionItems being called and always returning items).

I'm confused by the new menu, since it now shows a URL, that I cannot recognize. In my mental model, "Push to upstream" is just a shortcut for the "Push branch..." wizard, with one of the available remotes pre-selected. That's why I would rather suggest the label of the remote there, e.g. "Push to origin" in many cases. Or am I wrong about what the functionality of the current "Push to upstream" is?

The menu size was already reported in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=540778 and also happens with long branch names. If the new menu were to show the remote name, then this is probably not much of an issue, since I imagine typical remote names to be short (much shorter than some branch names, which that bug was about).

Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/DynamicSimplePushCommand.java -> even though that class is called parameter, would "item" be a less confusing name, maybe?

The current state really is only about being able to affect the label. Is "Push to upstream" really a shortcut for "Push branch"? The operation that is called pushes all configured refMaps to all configured push-URIs (at least that is what I read from the code.
This is why I am not sure about the label. "Push to <remoteName>" is more explicit than "upstream", but is it enough?

If the menu width is not really an issue, I will update the change accordingly.

Line:29, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/DynamicSimplePushCommand.java -> If it's a simple handler, can't we just make it implement IElementUpdater? See for instance org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.repository.tree.command.CheckoutCommand where this is used already.

Thanks for the IElementUpdater hint. I adapted the code accordingly. As both handlers already used SimpleConfigurePushDialog for obtaining the remote config, I placed the method for computing the push-to label there.

For now, only the remote name is shown. The question whether to indicate when several push URIs and mappings are present, is still open.
