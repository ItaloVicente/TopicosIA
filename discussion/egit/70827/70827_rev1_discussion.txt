DESCRIPTION:

Gerrit wizards should only show Gerrit URIs

The "Fetch from Gerrit" and "Push to Gerrit" wizards should only show
URIs known to refer to a Gerrit server. Such remotes have a refspec
destination with the Gerrit magic prefix "refs/for/".

In bug 491464, the Gerrit refspec was added manually, so there's no guarantee it was "refs/for/". Might just as well (and just as valid!) be "refs/publish/". Shouldn't we at least handle that one, too? The third one "refs/drafts/" is probably unlikely to be used in a remote...
