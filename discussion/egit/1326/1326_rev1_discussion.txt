DESCRIPTION:

Workaround for bug 322751

Since we can't fix the problems described in bug 322751,
this suggests are workaround to set the workbench selection
in a reliable way.
Ugly enough, it forces a hide/activate cycle on the
history view if it is not currently holding a GitHistoryPage.
This will enable the selection provider correctly.
This can only be done on the Team->Show History
context menu item, so we will have to remove the
generic Show In->History action where this workaround
is not available.

Talking to Paul Webster earlier... he mentioned this...

"It seems like the getSelection(*) in your handler should be updated. Have it get the activeMenuSelection first, and only try "selection" if activeMenuSelection is not available.

You still need "selection" if the command has to respond to keybindings, since activeMenuSelection is only available while the context menu itself is shown."

To fix this, the Generic History View from the Team UI plugin must be changed. Even if they would do it today, we can't take advantage of it until the next release.
