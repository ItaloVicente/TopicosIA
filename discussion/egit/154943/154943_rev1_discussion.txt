DESCRIPTION:

[repo view] Work-around for SWT regression on GTK

Remove the focus cell manager. It is needed only for keyboard
activation of inline cell editing, but we don't use that anyway
since we always go through the rename command, which is a
programmatic editor activation.

The focus manager ensures the focus cell is visible by calling
Tree.showItem(), which is specified to do nothing if the cell is
already visible. But since the changes made in the GTK version of
SWT for bug 552096, showItem() _always_ scrolls the item to the
center of the tree, which is quite annoying and makes double-clicking
an item impossible unless it already is in the center of the view.

As a work-around, remove that unnecessary focus manager.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> if this is a regression of the changes made for this fix shouldn't it be reopened or another bug be created to track the problem ?

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Bug 558496 was originally reported against EGit. By now, it has component Platform/SWT and is entitled "[gtk] [regression] Tree.showItem() scrolls even if the item is visible". So bug 558496 is that bug to track the regression in SWT, and merging this change should not close bug 558496.
