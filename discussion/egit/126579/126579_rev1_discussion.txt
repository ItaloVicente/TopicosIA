DESCRIPTION:

Use an asynchronous lightweight decorator in the repositories view

In the previous implementation, the label provider produced styled
labels that included the decorations. However, label providers run
in the UI thread, and complicated decorations like a branch state
(N commits ahead, M behind) could thus lead to UI blocks.

Newly, leverage Eclipse's built-in support. Use a lightweight
decorator for RepositoryTreeNode and register it in plugin.xml.
Separate out getting labels into a WorkbenchAdapter and adapt the
GitAdapterFactory accordingly. (We already created a WorkbenchAdapter
there, but first we always created a new one, and second, it always
created a RepositoriesViewLabelProvider just to get the label text.
That's terribly inefficient and the logic is completely backwards.)
Also use ImageDescriptors instead of Images where possible.

Factor out the handling of LabelProviderChangedEvent from
GitLightweightDecorator into GitDecorator and re-use it in the new
decorator for RepositoryTreeNodes.

Make the RepositoriesViewLabelProvider a WorkbenchLabelProvider, which
uses the singleton RepositoryTreeNodeWorkbenchAdapter to get labels.

Change the other uses of RepositoriesViewLabelProvider in dialogs to
work with the new setup.

UI changes from all that: next to none. Two differences I noticed in the
default theme on OS X:

1. Previously, the repositories view used two different styles in the
   decorations of a repository: the branch and status used the normal
   decoration style (a kind of light brown), while the repo directory
   appeared light gray. Decorations on other nodes (for instance,
   branches were all light gray). Newly all decorations use the default
   decoration style (light brown).

2. Decorations in the File->Import...->Projects from Git->Existing git
   repositories" page now actually work.

Otherwise, I notice much faster Eclipse startup.

Build will probably fail; I expect to have to adapt a number of tests to wait for decorations now.
