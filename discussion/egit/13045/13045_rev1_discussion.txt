DESCRIPTION:

Gerrit doesn't need /p anymore

Since Gerrit 2.3 the path segment /p is not needed anymore when
accessing Gerrit with the http protocol [1].

This patch was initially created because there was a bug in Gerrit when
pushing with /p [2], which has been fixed in the meantime. When testing
the change, bug 407984 was detected.

The logic to add /p is removed from the Gerrit Configuration wizard in
order to fix bug 407984, avoid unnecessary complexity and because
Gerrit 2.3 is deprecated since a long time: 2.3 was released in April
2012, the latest release is 2.5.4 and 2.6 will be released soon.
