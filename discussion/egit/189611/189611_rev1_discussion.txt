Thank you, Gayan, for this contribution.

I find this highly confusing.

First, I believe showing untracked files should be the default; the logic needs to be switched around. I.e., a button with a red diagonal across that file icon, and text "Hide untracked files".

Second, the setting should be persisted, possibly even per repository, so that if the user closes and re-opens the view, it is still effective.

Third, what if the user selects an untracked file in the package explorer and chooses "Team->Commit..." from the context menu and has "Use staging view for committing" enabled (which is the default)? In this case, I think untracked files should be shown always, since it is highly confusing and error prone not to show them. Too easy to forget to commit a new file.

Fourth, the "Unstaged Changes" header shows the number of changed files, for instance "Unstaged Changes (1)". When filtering the view, for instance by "*.vvv" (where no matching changed file exists), it'll show "(0/1)", i.e., the user has _some_ indication that not everything is being shown. (Personally, I think it's not prominent enough, but at least there is some feedback.) That must also be the case when this "hide" option is on. (And seeing that the button is checked is not sufficient, since it might be checked, but there are no untracked files.)

I'm not convinced this is a good idea in general. Why do you want to hide untracked files at all?

Finally a nitpick: please follow the EGit/JGit commit message guidelines (bug reference in the footers). See [1].

What if we make this toggle just a toggle which is by default showing the untrack files ? it will not listen to settings, As you point out it could be a problem when solving conflicts as well.

Will this be solved if we use the above mentioned strategy ?

Will this be solved if we use the above mentioned strategy ? because we will treat this as a filter and may be we can change the label for (0 of 1).

The reason i thought it will be a good idea is that, i really like the stage view since it doesn't block the UI like the commit dialog. in my workflows sometime i get find files which i don't want to commit, so having the untrack files option like in the commit dialog helps to have more focus view. My requirement is to have the commit dialog UI in the view instead of a dialog :). WDYT ?

Sure i can correct it in my next push.

You mean, basically just set the button checked initially? We could try that.

But I believe the state would need to be per repository. Otherwise there may be nasty surprises when you work with several repos, have the setting to hide untracked files in one repo, and then switch to another repo because you want to commit something there. Very easy to then forget that setting, and thus forgetting to commit an untracked file that should be committed.

Would probably still unconditionally have to re-enable showing untracked files. (And now that you mention it: probably also on conflicts.)

I don't see any connection with any strategy; simply an indication must be there when not all changes are shown.

I must admit I haven't used the Commit Dialog in years. It's also a basically unmaintained part of EGit that has seen no development since I started contributing 7 years ago. It's unchanged since 2015 save a few minor adaptations to newer developments elsewhere in EGit.

Re: "...in my workflow sometime..." Is "sometime" frequent enough to warrant such a change with its potential unwanted effects?

Also note: the CommitDialog does persist the setting (not per repo, though), and there's a preference ("Include selected untracked files") that can override the stored setting initially unconditionally and force showing untracked files whenever the dialog opens. A dialog is, of course, somewhat easier to handle than a view that remains open and that can switch between repos, possibly even depending on selections in other views or editors. But one might use the same preference to force showing untracked files whenever the view shows a particular repo for the first time.

Getting this right so as not confuse less experienced users and to avoid unpleasant surprises needs a bit of thought and possibly experimentation.

And users are used to the way it works currently. Whatever new behavior is implemented for this, it should by default not change anything for existing user with existing workspaces. Otherwise anyone who upgrades is in for a surprise. Even if people might eventually like such a feature, break it on them gently: have them do something consciously (like clicking that button) to get the new behavior. Anything else will just cause confusion.

I totally agree that we should not make any workflow changes to current users who are familiar with the state view. I really appreciate your thoughts which really helped me to see things i didn't thought of.

Yes checked the button by default regardless the mode of the staging view and also the user choice is not persisted at all and it will not listen to any of the settings either. So when this change is received by a user it will be basically transparent for them functionally, unless they try to use it. To make it more closer to current functionality, when every the content of the view is updated by 
- user selecting to commit
- conflict on a merge or rebase
- ammend commit

we will reset the button state to default. But at the same time if your commit file list is cluttered with lot of untracked files which you don't want to commit, then you can choose to hide them, and its a choice that the user make. To remind user there are untracked files we can update the label.

May be in the long run we can remove the commit dialog if that is not used by lot of users if the functionality of the dialog is covered in the view.
