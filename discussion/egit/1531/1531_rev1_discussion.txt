deprecated API in this place.

Is there a reason you're using 3.5 for dev still Robin?

A problem with @SupressWarning is that it is too coarse.This would be the first deprecated warning to suppress and I'm not convinced it is a good idea. We are programming for the 3.5 API and you will get different warnings depending on the Eclipse version you are running. This differs from other warnings, that do not depend on our Eclipse version. I.e. we know better what is hidden.

The SupressWarning annotation should perhaps refer to the use of addDerived, because anyone looking at the code with Eclipse 3.5 will not understand the problem. Replacement for what?

You can hide warnings in the problem filter.

In eclipse 3.5 you get another warning:
Unnecessary @SuppressWarnings("deprecation")

I recently added a TODO comment for both usages of setDerived in commit b07033deb2140b321b8d4882161f6e0431bcdb20.
So I think this change could be abandoned.

Actually, I thought we were targeting 3.4. Did I miss a memo?

In any case, I think it would be better to inline comments then to suppress the warning with annotations.

Yep, the initial thought was to eliminate the existing warnings but as stated above by Robin, these pop up again depending on the target platform you're using.

Abandoning this.
