DESCRIPTION:

Introduce common interfaces IRepositoryCommit and IRepositoryObject

Our command/action/handler architecture suffers from lots of
duplication. Basically each view has its own set of commands and
its own set of handlers that often end up doing similar things.
There are a few general commands at org.eclipse.ui.internal.commit,
but even those end up being duplicated in history.

This is all unnecessarily complicated, verbose, error-prone, and
honestly said, unmaintainable.

Let's start to clean this up by introducing common interfaces that
describe the logical objects. These interfaces can then be used in
plugin.xml in activation handlers, and handlers can be written against
selections of such objects. That will enable us to provide a single
set of commands for, say, RevCommits. If needed, these commands can
have different handlers with different activations.
