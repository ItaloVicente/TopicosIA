Maybe we should call it "viewer" then, since it is not an editor.

This is wrong. 

The fields should be editable, I think.

But more importantly, give people a decent chance to react and comment on your patches. Only self-submit if you really have to.

The editor does not support save so why should they be editable?

The class extends FormPage which extends EditorPart and so I think CommitEditorPage is an appropriate name.  Although it is read-only now, the plan is to make parts of it editable in the future (such as adding/editing notes https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=347034).

The reason I felt comfortable committing this change myself in a short time-frame was that is was a UI-quirk bug in an unreleased feature that I had developed and so I considered it trivial which the EGit contributor guide seems to support: "let non-trivial changes be in review for at least 24 hours"
