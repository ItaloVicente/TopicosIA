DESCRIPTION:

Show branch status in label decoration of project

The branch status is shown as a "*" in front of the branch name if the
current branch is different from the remote tracking branch. This is
useful as a visual indication that the branch needs to be pushed (or
merged/rebased).

For example, if there are unpushed commits on master, the project is now
shown like this (similar to a modified file that needs to be saved):

  project [repo *master]

In C Git, information about the tracking branch is displayed in "git
status" output. EGit currently doesn't have any indication that a branch
needs to be pushed, apart from the labels in History View. When there
are multiple repositories involved, it can easily happen that a push is
forgotten. This change helps prevent that.

I agree, would be nice to see this in History View as well.

Would be also interesting to see how many changes are unpublished similar to how mail clients can optionally show the number of unread mails.

Thanks for your comments!

I pushed a separate change, which shows more information: http://egit.eclipse.org/r/4678

If the other way is better, we can abandon this change and continue the discussion there.

Seems like this indicator may also be helpful to have in the repository's decoration in the repositories view.

What do you think about displaying it there as well?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:248, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceHelper.java -> Should this return null instead of empty String to be consistent with other non-decorating return cases in this method?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:250, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/DecoratableResourceHelper.java -> Do you think this should be configurable?

Similar to the dirty flag that defaults to '>' but can be changed?
