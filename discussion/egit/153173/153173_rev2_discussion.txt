DESCRIPTION:

[tests] Try to stabilize IndexDiffCacheTest

This test waits for a listener to be called. IndexDiff calculations
happen in the background. So when several files are added to the
workspace, several calculations may get scheduled, and the test may
end up not waiting long enough to pick up the expected change but
operate on an IndexDiff computed before the wanted file was added.

Run multiple workspace changes in a workspace operation with
IWorkspace.AVOID_UPDATE.

Did you use the runInWorkspace encapsulation to a) make the test more stable or b) because you believe it reflects the real workflow of the unit under test? In case of the A: Assuming that your listener fixes the actual root cause of the test, a group of separate workspace operations is more challenging for the unit test. I.e. there might be many plugins in eclipse that create resources without using a workspace operation, and egit must be able to deal with that correctly.

(a). This test sets a flag when the listener is called. It does several operations, so several jobs may get scheduled, the listener may get called multiple times. But the flag is set already the first time. So it's possible that waiting until the listener is called quits after the second of four file/folder creations, even though the test assumed it would at that time have picked up all four changes. The test assumption is wrong, using a workspace runnable makes it become true.
