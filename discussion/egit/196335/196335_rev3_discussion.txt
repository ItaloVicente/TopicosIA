DESCRIPTION:

Fail build if there are license issues with dependencies

Configure the dash license-tool-plugin to fail the build if there are
license issues with build dependencies. This plugin will generate a list
of all build dependencies and their license to target/dash/summary.

Delete the checked-in dependency list DEPENDENCIES since the build now
always generates it to target/dash/summary.

See https://github.com/eclipse/dash-licenses#example-maven-plugin

Line:298, pom.xml -> Probably this should set includeScope=runtime, or at least excludeScope=test? Or in the worst case exclude specific artifacts.

For instance, the build currently fails because it cannot find the JGit SNAPSHOT versions in clearlydefined or elsewhere. We *know* that licensing for JGit is fine (it runs its own dash check), so just exclude all org.eclipse.jgit*.

It also complains about some swtbot versions; probably because we're using snapshots again. And that's a test dependency anyway, so exclude all org.eclipse.swtbot*.

It also complains about jakarta.servlet-api, which is strange. Plus a number of other org.eclipse bundles that we may asssume fine. And why does it even look at org.eclipse.tools.layout.spy? We're not using it AFAIK; it must be some n-times-removed transitive dependency.

The jdt 3.18 dependency comes from test code only.

In any case it seems to me it might be sufficient to limit the license checking to bundles we actually distribute in the p2 repo. (egit, egit.core, egit.doc, egit.gitflow, egit.ui).

Line:298, pom.xml -> How can I configure includeScope or excludeScope for the dash license-check plugin ?

It seems some of the complaints were caused by issues with the backend and/or some content issues in that backend.

Line:298, pom.xml -> Wouldn't it be useful to just set dash.fail to false and to start using it? That way experimenting with further settings for reducing the scope might be easier, since it can evolve over time. And when the exclusions or whatever have been configured better, it can them become more strict again.

Line:298, pom.xml -> In a <configuration> element?

  <configuration>
    <includeScope>runtime</includeScope>
  </configuration>
  
Though looking again at the code[1], including/excluding scopes is probably not quite right. But group ids or artifacts might work.
