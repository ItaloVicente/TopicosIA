DESCRIPTION:

Check HOME environment variable on Windows on first usage of EGit

The home directory is calculated by concatenating HOMEDRIVE and
HOMEPATH if HOME is not defined. This can result in follow-up problems
e.g. the unwanted usage of a network share as home directory.
The user is shown an information dialog the first time EGit is used if
the HOME variable is undefined.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved; Build Successful; IP review completed

users still also need msysgit on windows for operations not yet suppported by egit, so it's better to do this check and ask the user to explicitly set HOME in case the default setting isn't ok

An even better way would be to allow the user to set the "HOME" directory from the preferences, I was kind of lazy, so
I just tried to emulate what I though MSys did.

Just replace the do-not-show-setting with a workspace override.

I was think about having a workspace setting instead of $HOME. If that variable is set we would use that instead of guessing where HOME is.

Patch Set 2:

Currently JGit computes HOME on Windows in the same way as msysgit.
I think we should keep this to ensure compatibility with the git command line.
