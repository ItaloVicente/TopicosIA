DESCRIPTION:

Git Import Wizard

This is the new Import wizard for importing Projects from Git.
Similar to CVS, it first shows a list of Git Repositories. The user
may select one from the list (the same list as shown in the 
Git Repositories View) and continues from there. Alternatively,
the user can clone or add a Repository to the list.
Then all continues like with the Import Projects... wizard
used in the Git Repositories View.

I like the direction this is going.

I recommend that on the first wizard page, "Clone a repository" and "Add local repository" become buttons and are moved to the right side of the list of git repositories. At the moment, they are simply located below the list of repositories which isn't optimal imho.
