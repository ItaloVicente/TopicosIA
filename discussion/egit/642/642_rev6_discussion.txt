DESCRIPTION:

Git Import Wizard

This is the new Import wizard for importing Projects from Git.
Similar to CVS, it first shows a list of Git Repositories. The user
may select one from the list (the same list as shown in the 
Git Repositories View) and continues from there. Alternatively,
the user can clone or add a Repository to the list.
Then all continues like with the Import Projects... wizard
used in the Git Repositories View.

Bug: 281394

Patch Set 6: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

This is great work with Mathias.

I found one issue with the UI and it's that the wizard opens with an error message. This is against the Eclipse UI guidelines and we should avoid this. I opened bug 311834 for us to fix this issue. Otherwise, we should push this now :)
