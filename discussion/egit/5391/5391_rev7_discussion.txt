DESCRIPTION:

(rebased) [historyView] Track renamed paths and provide to actions

Several History view actions currently fail when the view is
set to follow renames since they derive the path used from
the current repository path and do not take into account
older paths that the resource was known as.

This commit creates a simple RenameTracker class that tracks
which commits introduced renames allowing the GitHistoryPage
to provide the previous paths for a specific commit given the
initial path.

At the moment, rename tracking only works when "Show all changes of
selected resource and its children" is checked, because JGit currently
does not allow combining a FollowFilter with e.g. a PathFilter.

The commit also makes the commit viewer's "Compare with Previous
Version" honour renames.

Caveat: This change unfortunately undoes some of the work in
I4ae8abfc4dbe7ed772749afa80743278247585ee and my manual test coverage is
pretty low (IFile and IResource only)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think "(rebased) " should be removed also.

Line:63, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/command/CompareVersionsHandler.java -> There are now a lot of similar or identical code blocks here and in CompareVersionsInTreeHandler and CompareWithWorkingTreeHandler.

Maybe you could add another method to CompareUtils in order to avoid code duplication?
