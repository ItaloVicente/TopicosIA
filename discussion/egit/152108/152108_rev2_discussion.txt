DESCRIPTION:

Close repositories when they are no longer referenced

EGit uses a WeakReference cache for Repository instances. Because
it has no real control over where a Repository instance is referenced
from and when exactly it would be safe to close a repository, it
just didn't do so. Once a repository really was no longer referenced,
it would be garbage collected and disappear from the central cache
in EGit. But even then the repository was not closed.

Fix this by making sure Repository instances are closed when garbage
collected. This required an overhaul of the RepositoryCache: with a
simple WeakReference<Repository> the repository is already garbage
collected before EGit gets notified about it. Instead introduce a
RepositoryHandle: this is a wrapper around a Repository and delegates
all calls to its underlying real Repository. The RepositoryCache only
hands out such RepositoryHandles. Use a ReferenceQueue and a daemon
Closer thread to manage WeakReferences.

When a handle is no longer referenced it will be garbage collected,
and its WeakReference will be put onto the ReferenceQueue. Keep a
reference to the real Repository in the WeakReference, though. That
way the real repository is still available and can be closed when
the Closer thread pops the WeakReference from the queue.

Because a RepositoryHandle behaves exactly like the real underlying
Repository, clients won't notice any difference. RepositoryEvents are
intercepted by the RepositoryHandle and by the RepositoryCache for the
global listener list, and are forwarded with the handle substituted
for the real Repository. Thus a client never has access to the
underlying Repository instance. The only caveat is that a client must
not register a listener on JGit's global listener list but instead use
the global listener list from EGit's RepositoryCache.

Line:106, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/RepositoryCache.java -> just repo?

Line:369, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/RepositoryCache.java -> where does that come from? I would expect just the plain RepoHandle type, given the above member declaration.

Line:69, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/RepositoryHandle.java -> Since the delegate might be a handle itself, would it be necessary to add some code to unwrap it here, have an assertion to avoid it, or are nested handles perfectly fine?

Line:106, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/RepositoryCache.java -> Yes.

Line:369, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/RepositoryCache.java -> Needed because of the return type of queue.remove() above.

Line:69, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/RepositoryHandle.java -> That was never the intention. The class is package-visible only; the intention was that only the RepositoryCache ever creates RepositoryHandles, and that the delegate is always a real repo.

Initially I had this as a "private static" class inside RepositoryCache, but the file just got too large. So I settled for extracting it as a package-visible class.

I could make the constructor also package-visible only, and add an assertion here.
