thanks, works like a charm

Few minor nits only:

the vertical alignment of the URL edit field and the buttons Local Folder... Local Bundle File ... looks odd, maybe align centered vertically ? (I'll attach screenshots to the bug)

if the bundle filename has an extension e.g. myrepo.bundle I'd remove the extension for the target folder where the repository is cloned to since it feels unusual to use that for a repository name

sorry for not looking at your change earlier, I am swamped due to the chaos caused by the pandemic
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: add a colon after Bug and remove the blank line below so that this is recognized as a footer (in last paragraph of the commit message)

Bug: 560903

Line:546, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RepositorySelectionPage.java -> this yields 4 slashes on Mac OS which seems wrong, I'd expect only 3 slashes ("://" for separation of protocol and path and another "/" for the root path)

Line:546, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RepositorySelectionPage.java -> Line 527, too? Just noticed that in another context... Might be different on Windows, though.

I uploaded some screenshots to the bug illustrating what I meant

Regarding vertical alignment: I am not sure how to fix this as I am not that familiar with SWT layout. According to https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-Understanding-Layouts/Understanding-Layouts.htm vertically centered alignments should be the default. Do you have any hints why this does not work here?

Regarding target folder naming: Sorry not that familiar with your code, any hints where to sanitize the URI?
Line:546, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/RepositorySelectionPage.java -> That is a part I haven't really touched in this PR, but seems indeed like a bug (which has been there before). Gonna fix as well.
