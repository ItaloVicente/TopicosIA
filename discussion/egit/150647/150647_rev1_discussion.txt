DESCRIPTION:

Adapt RepositoryTreeNode to IPath

RepositoryTreeNode already has getPath method. It makes sense to provide
this information via IAdaptable. This is the case in particular for
nodes representing existing paths, i.e. repostory, base working
directory as well as the files and folders therein.

This has unwanted side-effects. The context menu in the repo view suddenly gets a Team sub-menu with a disabled "Ignore" entry, and the "Compare With" menu (two entries: HEAD and Index) is broken for files (had different entries before) and also shows up for repos.

What was the motivation for this change?

Patch Set 1:

The intention was to get access to the path representing the nodes in the repositories view without requiring an explicit dependency to egit (accessing the path via the actual class rather than the generic adaptable).
Use case is an "open extern" (folder/terminal) function we find quite useful, e.g. quickly opening a terminal to execute a command from a particular folder. This works from the package explorer if the project imported but not if you just have the cloned repository.

I agree that the negative side-effects out-weigh the advantage. The repository itself could be excluded (only working tree and contents) and the other new menu items could be argued to have incomplete checks (as the elements really do have those paths), but this change should not cause any inconvenience.

For that use case perhaps adapting working tree and folder nodes to java.io.File might work without adverse side-effects?
