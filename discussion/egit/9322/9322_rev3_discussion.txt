What happened now? The parent is the abandoned change...

Also, the commit message should describe what the change as a whole does, not what an individual patch set does.

Not sure. I accidentally pushed two commits with different change ids. The newer of these commits contained the change id of the original change, that was created by Peter Bäckman.

I could now squash these two commits, fix the description of the commit message and push again. Correct?!

Thanks for helping a Gerrit newbee!!!

Try it; it should work. Parent should be current origin/master.

Once it's cleaned up and if there's more changes to be done, amend your change and push again to create new patch sets for the same Gerrit change.
