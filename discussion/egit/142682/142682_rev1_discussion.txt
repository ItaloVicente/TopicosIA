Line:786, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/SpellcheckableMessageArea.java -> Since this has been an iterator before, your refactoring seems perfectly reasonable. However, when writing new code, I would probably always come to list.stream().forEach(), and not even think about an iterator. Is there any good reason to prefer one over the other, from your point of view?

Line:786, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/SpellcheckableMessageArea.java -> My personal view is to stick to iterator() unless I need the filtering/mapping and other advanced stuff that I can get only with stream(). But I'm an old-timer who programmed in Java from Java 1.0 and before that in languages most people can't even remember if they've heard of them at all, and before that 8-bit assembly. ;-)

Seriously though, I guess it's a matter of personal preference, and if it read stream().forEach() it would be OK for me, too. Might even have used that myself in other places.

When I look at the implementations of the things returned by ArrayList.iterator() and ArrayList.spliterator(), the old-style iterator is much simpler. For something as simple as an iteration, simpler should mean faster, shouldn't it? (Admittedly no guarantee about that.)

There was also recently a case where someone wanted to handle the first element specially. Ah yes, here: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/126802/9/org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/SwitchToMenu.java@227 Maybe doable with streams, but in any case it wasn't obvious to all involved how, but pretty straight-forward with an iterator.

Line:786, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/SpellcheckableMessageArea.java -> One more point: stream() or spliterators may actually read ahead and buffer things, which iterator() typically doesn't do.

That was a real pain in the Apache MINA sshd implementation for JGit. sshd used streams to "iterate" over the available keys. Because the stream buffered (pre-loaded items into the buffer), it actually loaded too many keys, even keys that then wouldn't be used. If one of these keys was encrypted, it'd ask the user for a passphrase even though the key would never be used.

For the initial sshd 2.0.0 implementation in JGit I had to override a number of framework classes with iterator-based implementations. For sshd 2.2.0 I got the sshd maintainer to fix this upstream. :-)
