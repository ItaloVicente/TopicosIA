DESCRIPTION:

Suppress history for structural RepositoryTreeNodes

Don't adapt the structural tree nodes of the repository view to history
input. This avoids unwantedly showing the full repository history when
clicking on any of those nodes just for expanding/navigating the tree,
therefore not loosing the history of the previously selected
branch/tag/ref.

I'm not sure this is the right approach. I also don't quite see what it brings. What exactly was the use case that prompted this?

Open history view with "Link to selection" on.

Open an editor on some tracked file. Go to the repo view and select another folder from the same repo. Go back to the editor.

History now shows the history of the file in the editor. Now I want to navigate elsewhere in the repo view. Activate repo view.

History view now shows the history of that folder. So I've lost the history I wanted to see.

If you want to keep a history, switch off "link to selection" in the history view, or pin it.
