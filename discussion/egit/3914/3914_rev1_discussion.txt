DESCRIPTION:

Extract 'Create Patch' into operation for reusability

In order to reuse the create patch functionality, it was extracted into
it's own operation, purely depending on JGit and decoupled from
FileDiff.

Also moved functionality for generating a filename for a specific commit
into the operation to be reusable. Tests added for the operation.

Great change.

However, I think now the patch does not work with different encoding anymore. Please see my inline comment.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/CreatePatchOperation.java -> This field was introduced in commit 0c90acfe in order to store the encoding of the currently processed file for use inside the DiffFormatter.

I admit that there is no test for files with different encoding (or even no test at all), but I think that now it does not work anymore. Could you please check this?
