DESCRIPTION:

Include local branch name in proposals

If "Push branch 'foo'" is run the default suggestion for the
upstream name is the configured remote tracking branch (if any).
The local branch name is suggested initially only if no remote
tracking branch is set.

A frequent use case for this dialog is to push a local branch to
a *new* remote branch with the same name as the local branch. But
since typically local branches are created off 'master' and do
have 'origin/master' set as tracking branch, a user has in this
case to type in the new upstream branch name. It wouldn't appear
in the proposals list, which showed only existing upstream refs.

Simplify this use case by including a ref for a new upstream branch
in the list of proposals if there is no existing upstream branch
with the same name as the local branch.

I'm quite happy about the "snappiness" and the removal of the modal "fetching remote..." dialog.

However, there are some other deviations which I'm not so sure about:
* Sorting must be re-added. I'm completely lost in the suggestions for empty input otherwise.
* The new list contains a lot of things the old implementation did not contain, and I assume that is unintended:
** a literal entry "HEAD"
** all tags
** pull requests like refs/pull/2/head when being used with a github remote. Those are listed with their name only, e.g. they have neither [branch] nor [tag] as suffix
Line:592, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/push/PushBranchPage.java -> You can still use the old approach of sorting this collection using ...sort(newRefs, CommonUtils.REF_ASCENDING_COMPARATOR)

Thanks for reviewing!

Right. I was so focused on the asynchronous aspect that I completely forgot to cross-check that the list contents are the same as before. Will fix soon.

Line:59, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> Was done in later patch sets, when the class was renamed.

In PS 6 they're still fairly long. Maybe shorten to

  AsynchronousRefProposalProvider_Fetching
  AsynchronousRefProposalProvider_Showing

?
