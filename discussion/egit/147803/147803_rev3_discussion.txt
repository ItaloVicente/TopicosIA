DESCRIPTION:

History: keep commit selected if branches to show change

Keep the currently selected commit selected when the user toggles
first-parent, show all branches, show additional refs, or the
follow renames settings.

Additionally, try to avoid jumping around in the history. Previously,
the code simply tried to keep the table at the current top row index.
But that doesn't really help when the branches to show change. (It may
have been fine for incremental loading.) Newly, try to keep the current
top commit shown by name. For incremental loading this gives the same
result; for other use cases it reduces the jumping around quite a bit.

Thomas, I'm wondering if this has unintended side effects. I think today I noticed for the first time that I don't see the new commits in history after pulling, since the old top commit stays on top. This was previously different, wasn't it? However, I'm completely not sure yet about that observation, might have been something else entirely.

What are your settings? Show all branches? Additional refs?

And "Follow selection"?

In an Eclipse with a somewhat older EGit without all these changes in the history view, with follow selection off, show all branches and additional refs on: when I scroll down in the history and select a commit, then do a fetch from upstream in the repo view, the git history also does not scroll to the top. It does update; the fetched commits are there when I scroll manually to the top.

You are probably right, that this is related to settings. I have to check the exact settings at work, but I remember that I started using several repo view filters and to not show additional refs in history, so that might be it.

With that explanation, I think there is no need to further investigate. Thanks for looking into it again.
