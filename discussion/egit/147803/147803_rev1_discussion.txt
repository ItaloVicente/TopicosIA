DESCRIPTION:

History: keep commit selected if branches to show change

Keep the currently selected commit selected when the user toggles
first-parent, show all branches, show additional refs, or the
follow renames settings.

Additionally, try to avoid jumping around in the history. Previously,
the code simply tried to keep the table at the current top row index.
But that doesn't really help when the branches to show change. (It may
have been fine for incremental loading.) Newly, try to keep the current
top commit shown by name. For incremental loading this gives the same
result; for other use cases it reduces the jumping around quite a bit.

Line:482, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/CommitGraphTable.java -> I would have moved it up a line and removed the -1, but it's fine.

Line:1861, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Not sure why you introduced 2 methods here. Wouldn't it be useful to always remain on the selected commit on a refresh? I.e. to inline the new argument again? The table code already deals with null etc.

Or is there some API expectation of the refresh method, which forbids this?

Line:1861, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Not that I know of. Yes, refresh() could be made to always try to keep the position. Not sure which behavior is expected by users, or would be most convenient.
