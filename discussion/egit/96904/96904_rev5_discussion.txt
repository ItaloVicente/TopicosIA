DESCRIPTION:

Fix synchronize with deleted resources

ResourceVariantTreeSubscriber.members() must return *all* resources
known to the subscriber, whether they exist in the "workspace" or not.

Otherwise resources that were deleted will be missed.

Git is a bit special in that we don't want to report .gitignored
resources, and untracked resources only if the user so wishes. Thus
our logic is a bit different and governed basically by what our 3-way
diff cache contains, but in any case we must include files
that only exist in the remote (i.e., in those caches).

Furthermore, isSupervised() must also work for IContainers, not just
for files. That was limited in commit 3fa9329 [1] to files to prevent
folders showing up with wrong markers. However, this kind of fix is
just plain wrong -- the new test could never work with that. But if
we re-consider folders as supervised, they'll show up as modified even
when they have no changes below. Our cache should contain IN_SYNC
entries for such folders. ThreeWayDifFEntry.scan() produces MODIFIED
entries, though.

Since I'm unsure about the interactions between scans with path
filters to partially update the EGit synchronization caches, I have
not touched that scan--it would be non-trivial to make it produce
IN_SYNC entries anyway, and then the cache update logic would probably
also have to be non-trivially adapted.

Instead I've chosen to perform a top-down check in GitSyncInfo and
return IN_SYNC for any folder that does not contain at least one file
that is itself not IN_SYNC.

Better now.

@Laurent, could you please take a look and also check that this plays nicely with the model-based comparisons in EMF compare? Also, two notes about the GitLazyResourceVariantTreeSubscriber (untouched by this change):

1. It always returns true from isSupervised(). Why? Is that still needed after this change?
2. It's still not very "lazy". I see the git sync cache being loaded initially (subscriber.init()), and then again through SubscriberResourceMappingContext.fetchMembers(). And the initial load takes a long time in the reproducer Dani gave in bug 516426, and even longer in my own test case (synchronizing org.eclipse.egit.core.internal between workspace (master) and origin/stable-4.4 -- which showed the same symptoms as in the bug report, since the whole org.eclipse.egit.core.internal.merge package was removed).

Line:98, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSyncInfo.java -> can't we do the recursion in the first loop without a second pass ?

Line:98, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSyncInfo.java -> We can. I don't think it matters much, but somehow I had the feeling that doing it this way would traverse a less deep hierarchy than a pure depth-first search and thus be faster in cases where there are non-IN_SYNC files.

Even better would be of course to either not have such folders in this GitSyncObjectTree, or have them have a ThreeWayDiffEntry that is already marked as IN_SYNC. But that would, as I mentioned in the commit comment, be a more adventurous undertaking. It's also one of those cases I mentioned in the comment in bugzilla: I haven't figured out yet why we have nodes/diffs for such trees at all. I see where they're coming from, but I don't know if that's intended or whether they do have some purpose somehow or could be safely eliminated.

Line:98, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/synchronize/GitSyncInfo.java -> ok, I did some experiments and you are right it doesn't really matter.
The method consumes only a small fraction of the overall runtime of the comparison.

This method could be also implemented using streams :

 private boolean hasNonSyncFile(GitSyncObjectCache obj) {
    Optional<GitSyncObjectCache> found = obj.members().stream().filter(
       child -> (!child.getDiffEntry().isTree() && child.getDiffEntry()
          .getChangeType() != ThreeWayDiffEntry.ChangeType.IN_SYNC)
          || (child.getDiffEntry().isTree() && hasNonSyncFile(child)))
       .findFirst();
    return found.isPresent();
 }
