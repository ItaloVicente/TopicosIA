DESCRIPTION:

Indent history table columns

Let SWT paint the columns (except the one with the plot) to get native
indentation and abbreviation of texts.

Estimate the column width of the commit id column using "bbbbbbb"
instead of "0000000", since "0" is actually quite narrow in many fonts.
"mmmmmmm" would be the most secure variant, but that leads to much empty
space in practice, so "bbbbbbb" seems like a good compromise between
excessive free space and cutting the end often.

Thomas, please test this version again and watch closely for how the first column looks like. With your suggestion almost all SHA1s were missing 1 or 2 characters on Windows (due to more indentation applied, but our width calculation assuming little indentation). Therefore I have adapted the calculation of the width to take a bigger indentation into account and to estimate the width using wider characters. Still that is just an estimation, but browsing the recent egit history there was not a single cut SHA1 in the first 3 pages. See bugzilla for a screenshot of the first column now.

Just as a note for reviewers: If you want to test with a maximum commit id font width, you may want to patch CommitLabelProvider, line 110 to return "mmmmmmm". :)

>  "mmmmmmm". :)

Why "m"? SHA1s are in hex, so all you ever get is 0-9 and a-f. Is there any (reasonable :-)) font in which these characters are as wide as "m"? 

Anyway, if "0000000" is too small on Windows, can we factor this width computation out? The RebaseInteractiveView does a similar computation... (but additionally considers the header width).
