DESCRIPTION:

[repo view] Tag filtering

Provide a new command that allows a user to filter tags by name
in the repositories view. The command is bound to the standard
"Find" command (Ctrl/Cmd-F) and is for now enabled only on the
TagsNode. The command expands the node and pops up a search text
field providing near-realtime filtering of the children of the
"Tags" node.

Filter patterns accept the '*' and '?' wildcards, and can be
anchored at the beginning (first character '^') and at the end
(last character '$').

I am not opposed to dealing with that in a different change. And I am absolutely not opposed to filtering by commit date. In fact, I wasn't even thinking about the date of tagging (as we typically have a release build which commits a version update and tags that commit, so commit date and tag date are basically the same).
Line:558, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesViewContentProvider.java -> I am wondering if this is necessary. Isn't new SearchPattern() enough? Basically, you make infix search the default. But prefix search is more likely to be wanted, isn't it? If I look  for a version 8.7.0 and start typing 8. the list will contain 1.8.X, 2.8.X,... before coming to 8.7 (which is way down due to the sorting).
I'd be happy to type "*8" when looking for a version having an 8 somewhere in the middle.

Line:558, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesViewContentProvider.java -> I was wondering about that, too. But EGit tags are named "v5.6...", so if we flip this and I type any character except v the list will be empty.

What do you think about persisting the filters? FilterChache already has all the needed information.
The tree expansion state is not persisted, but repository groups are and so are the other Pre-set filters, so it may be a matter of taste to which category these filters belong. I vote for persisiting. I see it as a more customizable form of the other filters - narrow down the view content to what I really need for working. And for projects with many tags this long list - with the wrong sorting ;-) - has always bothered be.
I would want to define a tag filter once and want it to stay defined until I change it again.

Thanks for following up on the sorting problem this way.
Line:558, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesViewContentProvider.java -> I can live with both versions and maybe the implicit start wildcard is indeed more user-friendly. It is easier to understand what is happening if "unexpected" matches are shown rather than noting.
