DESCRIPTION:

[repo view] Tag filtering

Provide a new command that allows a user to filter tags by name
in the repositories view. The command is bound to the standard
"Find" command (Ctrl/Cmd-F) and is for now enabled only on the
TagsNode. The command expands the node and pops up a search text
field providing near-realtime filtering of the children of the
"Tags" node.

Filter patterns accept the '*' and '?' wildcards, and can be
anchored at the beginning (first character '^') and at the end
(last character '$').

PS 5: position of the text field improved, and (possibly anchored) wildcard matching.

For that we would need to know what date format the tags used, and it would not find
recent tags that didn't follow that format.

I'd much rather we'd consider this again in another commit and then really filter by commit date. If it's really still needed now that wildcards are supported. (Still not the same as < or > some date, but for practical purposes it comes close enough I think.)
