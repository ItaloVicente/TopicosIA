DESCRIPTION:

RFC: [repo view] Tag filtering

Provide a new command that allows a user to filter tags by name in the
repositories view. The command is bound to the standard "Find" command
(Ctrl/Cmd-F) and is for now enabled only on the TagsNode. The command
expands the node and pops up a search text field providing near-
realtime filtering of the children of the "Tags" node.

Just functional review: I like the feature very much!! 

The position of the search field is a bit strange depending on the width of the view. I'd like it to be right on or very close to the "Tags" label. Even if the view is not too wide, it is too much to the right (at least on Windows).

How about interpreting a find pattern -<number><d/w/m/y> as time restriction: -15d=tags of the last 15 days, -3m = last 3 months etc. Because the string matching alone would make it hard to filter tags version 4.9 onwards, this would be a *very concise* way to restrict the number of shown tags (see my original repo view filtering Bug 540003). I know this could turn into a filter language specification/support discussion (where to stop?). But I sure know I'd be sad if filtering on tag name only was possible.

Playing around with the egit tags I could also imagin restricting to *-r tags to be desirable (interpreting ^ and $ in the pattern).

Right, I tested only with the git repo view in the left stack, below the package explorer, and that isn't too wide in my setup. It should be possible to put this after the label text.

Then we're starting really to filter not by name but by commit date. But thinking more about this, I'm not sure it's needed. The recent tags should be shown in the git history view not too far down, shouldn't they?

But we could easily change this to handle ^ and $ (at the start or end of the pattern) or even general regular expressions. Or maybe even have a ToolItem next to the text field with a drop-down menu to select the mode (string, regexp, or date). One thing to consider, though, is that as soon as we implement some pattern matching language ("-15d", or regexps), we should also have some mechanism to display an error message if the pattern is invalid. Maybe again a tooltip, as in the MessagePopupTextCellEditor. And then the whole code definitely needs to be factored out into its own class.

BTW, I tried a CellEditor first, but that didn't work well. Maybe I should try again, though.

They may be nearer the top, but there may still be a lot of scrolling necessary. One wrong click and you are again scrolling to an "unknown" location (I am thinking of the compare with each other use case). I'd find having a short list of recent tags in the repositories view very appealing.

Let's forget about the regex matching for now. If there was a dropdown/code completion with something "last 10 day, last 4 weeks, last 6 months, last 2 years" which then translates directly into the text pattern, I think error messages would not be necessar, but I may be overly optimistic.
