DESCRIPTION:

[sync] Fix newly created files in 'working tree' node

The newly created files was not included in 'working tree' node because
the DirCacheIterator was not found in TreeWalk instance. It also appears
that we don't need to have instance of DirCacheIterator to get list of
children in GitModelWorkingTree and GitModelCache.
