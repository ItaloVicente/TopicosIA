DESCRIPTION:

Decorators: cache more repository state

Generalize the mechanism previously only used for the branch state
in the DecoratableResourceHelper. This cached the branch state per
repository and relied on the label providers clearing that cache
when needed.

Use the same mechanism for more repository state, similar to what
had been done in commit 8bf986c3 for handler enabling. Make
RepositoryStateCache abstract; move the clearing on selection
changes into a separate subclass and use that instead. Give
decorators their own cache instance, and make sure they use it
instead of computing things themselves over and over again.

This is really hard stuff for a review. I'm wondering especially how to debug potential bugs in this...
Line:42, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/RepositoryStateCache.java -> Sonar always tells me that an EnumMap is more efficient, but I don't really know it myself. Also if I get it right, your inner instances are concurrent maps, and I guess there is no crossover of an enum-and-concurrent map, right?

We already used the RepositoryStateCache. I just moved it, made it abstract, factored out the cache invalidation into SelectionRepositoryStateCache. So that bit is all old code refactored.

The new stuff is the new DecoratorResourceStateCache and its uses.

Sorry, I thought it would be clear from the commit message. I didn't want to do the refactoring in a separate commit; it makes not much sense without the new subclass, and that one doesn't make much sense without its uses.
Line:42, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/RepositoryStateCache.java -> Yes.

My comment wasn't meant to criticize your workflow or code at all. Just a matter of fact observation that this is complicated stuff, if you are not a regular reader of that part of the code base.

Nevertheless, how do you intend to proceed? I currently see 3 groups of open changes:
* caching
* repo view groups
* all other
I believe your caching changes are good to go (except for submodule, due to its dependency), therefore I suggest you merge them, if you think the same.
I guess the repo group stuff still cannot be merged due to the process not being finished? If so, I would merge some of the smaller changes after you merged the caching (I've not merged any of those since some weeks, I think).

Exactly. I want to rebase these three caching changes now, then merge them. Yes, the repo groups still are stuck in the CQ process.

Thanks for the reviews!
