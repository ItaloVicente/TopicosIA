DESCRIPTION:

Import wizard does not remember last wizard

The page asking for the wizard to use does not
remember the "last used" wizard if it was the
"New Project" wizard. After fixing this, another
issue was found: when the "New Project" wizard
is selected initially, the tree should be disabled.
