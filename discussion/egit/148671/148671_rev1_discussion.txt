DESCRIPTION:

Cache the current head for CommitGraphTable.doPaint()

doPaint() called input.getHead() every time. This is a fairly expensive
file access occurring on the UI thread for every row. At least, it will
check whether HEAD and the ref it may point to have been modified.

Reduce the number of such calls by caching the head Ref until a new
input is set. This is valid since the table will be re-loaded anyway
when a repository change is detected.

Similar use case as in Idd369b50d8b4bd6dd68b30d640bbc13f5a5976c5: child Eclipse with the Java perspective, no open editors, git repo view visible containing 15 repos (one of which is the egit repo), EGit projects imported in workspace, no trees open in package explorer. History view visible, search toolbar not active, show all branches and show additional refs on, follow selection on. Steps:

1. Start Eclipse. History view is empty.
2. Select the egit project in the git repositories view. History view shows the history of the egit repo.
3. Scroll down and up in the commit graph table in the history view.

Without this change, calls to Repository.getConfig() and Filesnapshot.isModified() on the UI thread quickly go into and beyond the 10_000s. With this change, there's still a lot of such calls, but the number is reduced by a factor of about 100 (so where before I got 10_000s, I now get 100s).

Note that the head ref is used *only* to bolden the branch name that is HEAD.
