DESCRIPTION:

Git Configuration UI

The "Properties" view shows the configuration of the repository
currently selected in the repositories view. The toolbar was cleaned up
and simplified and the "direct editing" available in the properties view
was removed. Instead, when hitting a new "Edit" button in the toolbar, a 
dialog appears presenting the same UI that is used in the "Global Git Configuration"
preference page which can then be used to edit the configuration in a comfortable
way.

Thanks Remy, superb review.
All inline comments done.

I'm afraid I don't quite understand your remark regarding the layout of the buttons, though. What's the symptom?

Your other remark regarding applying the chagnes only upon "OK" is absolutely valid. Actually, I would rather remove the OK button and use "Apply" and "Cancel" instead (ideally with "Apply" being enabled only when the config is dirty). I already have a TODO in the class javadoc of ConfigurationEditorComponent for this. I suggset to open a new bug/feature request for this. I can create the bug, just let me know if that's ok with you.

If you look at the widths of the 'Change', 'Delete', and 'Add' buttons. They are all different. It would look better if they were identical.

And yes, feel free to use a new bug/change to make the editor only commit changes when explicitly asked to.
