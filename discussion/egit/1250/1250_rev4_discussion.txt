DESCRIPTION:

Git Configuration UI

The "Properties" view shows the configuration of the repository
currently selected in the repositories view. The toolbar was cleaned up
and simplified and the "direct editing" available in the properties view
was removed. Instead, when hitting a new "Edit" button in the toolbar, a 
dialog appears presenting the same UI that is used in the "Global Git Configuration"
preference page which can then be used to edit the configuration in a comfortable
way.

Ok, here we go. I wasn't aware that different widths of the buttons would be considered ugly, but here we go.
I opened bug 323239 for the proper "Save" implementation.

Absolutely. So do you think this is good enough now?

Yes, I think this is better now. We can improve on it as necessary with separate commits.

"Ugly" might be a bit much but if you click around other preference pages in Eclipse, you will see that they all have the same general width.

In fact, some of them are even wider than they need to be given the light amount of text they are displaying (like the 'OK' and 'Cancel' buttons).

Consistency is important in my opinion.
