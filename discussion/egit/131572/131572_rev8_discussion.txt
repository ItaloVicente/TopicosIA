DESCRIPTION:

Parallelize multi-repository pull

For each pulled repository a job is created that performs the pull
operation and refreshes affected projects. Each pull job defines a
scheduling rule for the affected projects. Created new core pull job
rule and configured it to have the same icon as the ui pull rule used by
the parent job.

The overall action waits until all scheduled jobs are
terminated, via job group API. Introduced new egit.core preference
"core_maxPullThreadsCount" (default is 1), which defines how many
parallel pull jobs are allowed, and added a UI for that preference on
the EGit root preferences page.

Changed IndexDiffCacheEntry.waitForWorkspaceLock() to wait for affected
projects only, not for the workspace root lock. This allows git status
recalculation for updated repositories start immediately after pull and
not wait for all jobs to be done.

Line:246, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> In the old implementation, projects were always refreshed, even in case of the pull operation throwing an exception. Now projects are not refreshed anymore in case of exception.

Can we have the situation that a pull operation has modified _some_ files on disk and then throws an exception? If so, there is now a difference in what the user sees after the operation.

Line:195, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/GitPreferenceRoot.java -> I'm slightly confused. I thought a secondary preference store is used for preferences that can be re-defined on project level? Or am I completely wrong with that? Nevertheless I don't get why we have a very small number of egit preferences using this secondary store. I would expect all of them to use the normal store.

Line:246, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> refreshNeeded only returns false in two cases where refresh is really not needed, the code seem to be safe here

Line:195, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/GitPreferenceRoot.java -> There are two plugins involved - egit.core and egit.ui. The page itself is from UI plugin, but we also want change core values here, therefore two stores and different values saved in different stores.

Line:195, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/GitPreferenceRoot.java -> No, that's not the purpose. The preference page framework supports out of the box only preference pages that display/modify preferences from one plug-in; the one returned by doGetPreferenceStore(). That's the UI preferences here.

But EGit has a number of preference pages that contain preferences from both UI and core. That's why this "secondary" preference store was introduced. Here, it returns the CORE preferences for those items that should be stored in/read from there.

See I68ac0f6807bcae10d598e8e090cee48d2c8ac830 .
