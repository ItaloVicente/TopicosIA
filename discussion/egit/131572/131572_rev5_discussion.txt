DESCRIPTION:

Parallelize multi-repository pull

For each pulled repository a job is created that performs the pull
operation and refreshes affected projects. Each pull job defines a
scheduling rule for the affected projects. Create new core pull job rule
and configured it to have the same icon as the ui pull rule used by the
parent job.

The overall action waits until all scheduled jobs are
terminated, via job group API.

Changed IndexDiffCacheEntry.waitForWorkspaceLock() to wait for affected
projects only, not for the workspace root lock. This allows git status
recalculation for updated repositories start immediately after pull and
not wait for all jobs to be done.

Just moved the job class down to allow better diff with previous version.

Line:476, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> this method name seems no longer a good fit

Line:326, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> why does this now return null ?

Line:476, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/indexdiff/IndexDiffCacheEntry.java -> One can read it as "workspace lock on related projects", so I left it as is.

Line:326, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> The one big rule not used anymore for the current operation, so null rule as no rule.

Thanks Andrey for stepping up! The code looks much better now for me and works as expected.

Thomas, any comments from your side? Are we done, or is something missing for merge?

I don't have time to review this in the near future or even to try it out. My questions about what happens with the CredentialsProvider if we have multiple repos with ssh URIs and password-protected keys etc. are still unanswered. At the very least I expect someone to try this case and report the experience.

What's the rush anyway?

Have multiple SSH based repos and delete secure storage before pull?

Right, credentials. Is there a way to know if a pull will ask for a password upfront? We could group such jobs so that the run sequentially.

And yes, I would like to see it soon because I use multi pull every day. Therefore I think we should add a preference for it until we have a solution for credentials provider.

No, there isn't.

Another, simpler case that provokes user interaction: have repos with ssh URIs, but remove (or comment out) the host keys in known_hosts.

Or HTTPS URIs to a server with a self-signed certificate, with sslVerify on. Apparently self-signed certificates are not unusual in some in-house setups...
