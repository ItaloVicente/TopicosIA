DESCRIPTION:

Parallelize multi-repository pull

For each pulled repository a job is created that performs the pull
operation and refreshes affected projects. Each pull job defines a
scheduling rule for the affected projects. Created new core pull job
rule and configured it to have the same icon as the ui pull rule used by
the parent job.

The overall action waits until all scheduled jobs are
terminated, via job group API. Introduced new egit.core preference
"core_maxPullThreadsCount" (default is 1), which defines how many
parallel pull jobs are allowed, and added a UI for that preference on
the EGit root preferences page.

Changed IndexDiffCacheEntry.waitForWorkspaceLock() to wait for affected
projects only, not for the workspace root lock. This allows git status
recalculation for updated repositories start immediately after pull and
not wait for all jobs to be done.

This works mostly well for me.
One thing that I recognized: I changed one repository to SSH. A login dialog appeared and I cancelled the login. The process continues with the other repositories as expected. At the end, the cancelled job stays in the progress view (properly marked as cancelled) and has to be cleaned up manually. On master the process continues as well, but at the end the progress view is clean.

Does this cancelled job show a dialog if you click on it? Jobs with linked actions are kept in the error log until they are acknowledged by users. I will check this.

Karsten, I've confirmed that the jobs are working as expected. Previously we had no dedicated jobs, so the "failed" actions were lost. Now the failed jobs can be inspected by user to see the root cause of the fail.

Thomas: thanks, next patch is coming.
