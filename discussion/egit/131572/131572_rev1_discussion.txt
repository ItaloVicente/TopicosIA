DESCRIPTION:

Parallelize multi-repository pull

For each pulled repository a job is created that performes the pull
operation. The overall action waits until all scheduled jobs are
terminated. Progress of each pull is reported to the job's monitor.
At the end all affected projects are refreshed in a single step.

It would make sense to start refreshing immediately and not wait for all pulls to complete. However this can cause extra compile cycles if dependent repos are pulled in wrong order. Having earlier refresh will allow faster compile for unrelated projects. May be a preference here?

Good point. I had this first and experienced dead locks when jobs waited for refresh. But I may have to think better about the scheduling rules.

I've been toying with idea at the back of my head, too. Could be done for other operations, too (Fetch, multi-repo branch switch, perhaps Push).

What happens if there are several repos with ssh remote URIs and password-protected keys with the passwords not in secure store? Will the user get multiple layered credential dialogs, or will they appear one after the other? What if some of the repos use the same password-protected key? Is it guaranteed that the user gets asked for a password for that key only once? What if the user mis-types the password?

Also very good questions. Have to test that.

One could add preference to disable run pull in parallel until we got all possible side effects fixed.

I have no code right now, but deadlocks could be caused by the pull operation rule. This rule should be removed from the master job and fine grained rules given to each pull child, plus same for refresh jobs (rule per project to refresh).

line 333 must be changed to null rule and single tasks get simpler rules

thanks for this nice improvement, works like a charm, some minor issues to fix
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> performs

Line:247, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> style nit: remove trailing whitespace, also below
