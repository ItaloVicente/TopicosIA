DESCRIPTION:

Parallelize multi-repository pull

For each pulled repository a job is created that performs the pull
operation and refreshes affected projects. Each pull job defines a
scheduling rule for the affected projects. Created new core pull job
rule and configured it to have the same icon as the ui pull rule used by
the parent job.

The overall action waits until all scheduled jobs are
terminated, via job group API. Introduced new egit.core preference
"core_maxPullThreadsCount" (default is 1), which defines how many
parallel pull jobs are allowed, and added a UI for that preference on
the EGit root preferences page.

Changed IndexDiffCacheEntry.waitForWorkspaceLock() to wait for affected
projects only, not for the workspace root lock. This allows git status
recalculation for updated repositories start immediately after pull and
not wait for all jobs to be done.

Great work, Andrey. Good from my side, but let's see what Thomas & Matthias say.

As I said, I currently have no time to do a detailed review or try it out. It's OK for me. @Karsten, is the "left-over job in progress" problem solved now with the progress monitor fixes?

No, but I read from Andrey's comment from Nov 3 9:46 that this is expected and even an improvement:

> Previously we had no dedicated jobs, so the "failed" actions were lost. Now the failed jobs can be inspected by user to see the root cause of the fail.

Let us merge it, if anything else is missing, we will just fix it. The idea itself is great, and by default no one should notice anything anyway.

Did a quick scan over the code; found no obvious problems. Just two nits; otherwise looks good to me.
Line:76, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitCorePreferences.java -> Right now this is only for pulls, agreed. But how about doing similar optimizations fro fetch, branch switch, push?

Would we want to have separate preferences? Probably not. So could we maybe call this constant "core_maxGitOperationThreadsCount", and the pref key "core_max_git_operation_threads_count"? Would be mighty strange if we did the same for push in the future and then ended up using a pref key that says it was for pulls...

Or did you foresee using different preferences for different operations?

Line:262, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> This is not needed. instanceof will be false for a null argument.

Line:76, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/GitCorePreferences.java -> I think fetch is the only we can share this preference with, so we can rename it to core_max_fetch_threads_count.

Should we, or can we keep "pull" for fetch too?

For the rest - I think branch switching happens locally and different threads would make sense here too, but I haven't ever a need for that. If we add this, this would be interesting how fast it works in general. Right now I'm running pull option with value of 50 to pull all repos I have in once. For branches, disk IO is the bottle neck, having 50 there would be an overkill I guess.

For the "push" one usually don't work on so many repositories anyway, so multi-push is not something useful, so we also do not offer this for multiple repositories.

Line:262, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/PullOperation.java -> Was part of the old code base, haven't noticed this until now :-).
