Good start, but needs more work. Editable logic for the tag message is inverted.

Should be able to move lightweight tags. Allows to turn an annotated into a lightweight tag, but not vice versa. Setting the tag message read-only when "lightweight" is chosen is a bit confusing; there's no visual feedback. Perhaps additionally clear the text area (saving the text, so that it can be restored if "lightweight" is switched off and the user didn't select a different existing tag in the meantime).
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please see the contributor's Guide about the format of our commit messages.[1] Basically, add the bug number in the footer.

Line:678, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CreateTagDialog.java -> I think this is the condition for !editable, i.e., readOnly.

Line:720, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CreateTagDialog.java -> This forbids moving lightweight tags, and keeps the overwrite button disabled. This should be improved; it's very strange that I can move annotated tags but not lightweight tags. Command-line git allows me to move a lightweight tag with git tag -f myLighweightTag <commitId>. I see no reason why TagOperation shouldn't be able to move a lightweight tag?

Actually in my first version I tried to clear the text in the message field but it created a strange loop. I will take a look. Another option would be: no message -> lightweight tag, message -> annotated tag. So no button needed but I don't know if it's better from user point of view.
Line:678, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CreateTagDialog.java -> You are right. A regression of the latest fix.

Line:720, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CreateTagDialog.java -> I think it's out of scope for this bug. I just added a button to create a lightweight tag since it's not possible to use egit now to create this kind of tag. If there are multiple problems we should track them with different bug reports instead of use a single commit.

Might be even simpler for the user. Maybe add an explanation then (something like "Without message a lightweight tag will be created")?
Line:720, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CreateTagDialog.java -> I don't agree. Before I just couldn't do anything with lightweight tags, now I can, and the behavior is inconsistent. The feature is not adding a "lightweight" button, it's making this dialog able to deal with lightweight tags. And this dialog can not only create tags but also move tags.

If you prefer to have separate bug reports for that, create them and push follow-up commits to Gerrit, but frankly said I think it's overkill since as far as I see the fixes will all be in the same files (probably even in this class here only) and won't be huge.
