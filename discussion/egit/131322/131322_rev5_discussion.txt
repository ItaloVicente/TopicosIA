DESCRIPTION:

Removes the check if the parent directory has a .project file when
sharing a project

This removes the check (and related messages) for the parent folder
having a .project file when sharing a project. This is not needed
anymore.

As I said: needs a test. Actually I'm surprised that apparently we don't have one for this case.

I'm not sure, I understand what we should test here? As far as I can tell this removes something that should have been tested.

This needs a test that sharing nested projects works. Looks like we didn't have a test that tried this and expected a failure before, since such a test would fail now if it works now.

So this needs two tests:

* parent project already exists, new project gets shared in a subfolder
* project exists in some subfolder, new project file appears in parent folder

The first test case I understand.
For the second test case, I have clue to me what you mean here, or what use-case this is supposed to test.

You're right, second case doesn't occur with Team->Share. (Was thinking about a .project file being added in a parent folder, maybe by other contributor, then pull and import project. But then the projects already are "shared".)

However, what probably also should be tested:  Unshared nested project exists; parent project gets shared: both projects should be shared afterwards.

Indeed, a good test-case. And I quickly did a manual check, this one fails with the current patch. Parent project cannot be deleted.

Another test case: parent and nested project, both unshared. Nested project gets shared. Parent project remains unshared. Then parent project is shared. And one also needs to think about what happens if the repo path is changed by the user! Consider:

/parent/.project
/parent/nested/.project

I share "nested" to repo path /projects, so it ends up at
/projects/parent/nested/.project. (Or /projects/nested/.project? I actually don't know; didn't try this patch.) When I later want to share "parent", am I allowed to choose a different repo path? Maybe even inside nested? Or do we impose some limitations? If so, which ones?

In this case, I think that we can assume that Eclipse does not keep track of this history. So, when the nested project is shared, the parent becomes a project without nested projects.
In that case, you are free to push the parent to any location you like.

A good test case would be indeed, if you are allowed to push (any project) as the parent of an already project, making the latter a nested project. Though this case might be similar as pushing to a directory that already contains contents. I don't know what would happen currently.

I pretty busy with other things right now. From my POV this patch can be taken over by anyone interested. Otherwise I'll see if I can find time soon. Sorry for the delays.

Thomas, any chance that this can be manually tested and made available to the user? Current behavior is very annoying.

Rolf already tested one case manually, and it failed.

And in such a critical area I do want automated test cases that catch regressions.

Do we have similar tests in EGit which I can use to review while trying to create test for sharing projects?
