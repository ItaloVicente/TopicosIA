DESCRIPTION:

Fix focus handling in GitHistoryPage

GitHistoryPage.setFocus() unconditionally and always set the focus
to the commit graph table. Somehow that caused the focus tracking
for the various global actions (copy & selectAll) that are registered
and unregistered on focus changes to be thrown off when some action
in the CommitFileDiffViewer activated some other view or editor, and
focus then came back to the CommitMessageViewer.

So use the mechanism used already in the CommitEditor: remember which
control last had the focus, and if possible focus that one in
GitHistoryView.setFocus().

This fixes the handler conflicts we got that caused copy to no longer
work. I also verified manually that bug 322751 and bug 477510 do not
re-appear, and that the repository switch still works.

Patch Set 3:

Tested on OS X 10.12.6 and CentOS 7.4. On Mac, the handler conflict never occurred. On CentOS, I have been unable to provoke a handler conflict after this change.

I must admit I do not entirely understand why we got these handler conflicts in the first place. I found no missing or duplicate focus events on CentOS, and while always focusing the commit graph table may have been less than optimal, it should not have caused handler conflicts.

I suspect that there is still an elusive bug in some underlying component on Linux, SWT or gtk or E4 or somewhere else, and this change just happens to avoid it.

We used to have these handler conflicts in the Jenkins log, too, but I haven't seen them there for a long time.
