Works better now. Any plans to use this for validation, too? (Like, disable the "Add" button if the value is not legal, at least for keys where we do have the legal values?) Would mean all valid values would need to be in the proposals, including "false" (where applicable).

Any plans to add more keys?

But in itself, this works fine now.
Line:49, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/ConfigEntryProposal.java -> Can also be set to "false". What's the reason to omit it from the content assist?

Line:52, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/ConfigEntryProposal.java -> Appears to exist only in git-for-windows. Maybe show only if running on Windows? I presume it can also be set to "false"?

Not really, since it is to easy to miss a valid value. E.g. a new release of command line git may support a new value for an existing key, and we would suddenly reject that one until we have extended our list of available values.

 > Any plans to add more keys?

I have added what I use a lot myself, and where I'm somewhat confident I can describe the alternatives in an understandable way. :)
If you feel there are other important or often used keys and values, feel free to add them. I myself will probably only add more on "once every while" base. Also I do know quite many developers based on eclipse which have never used command line git, and those should find at least "essential" keys and values.

Regarding your question of missing "false" keys: I will add those. I left them out deliberately where they are just the defaults, but it probably makes sense to always shows every available option.
Line:52, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/ConfigEntryProposal.java -> The NLS entry contains a hint that this is Windows only. While we could easily suppress this on non-Windows machines, having it here (in a somewhat promient way due to the reduced number of overall proposals) for everyone may help non-Windows developers to understand why their Windows colleagues have trouble with the shared git repo containing paths of 300 characters.

I personally have run into this issue multiple times. Looking around the web also shows that Windows developers regularly fail cloning repositories like spring-boot due to very long paths.
