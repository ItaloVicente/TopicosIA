Cool idea, but the dynamic adding of value proposal providers doesn't work and isn't necessary either.

I think we did something with dynamic lightbulbs in the BranchNameNormalizer. A similar approach could be used here, but adding the content proposers only once, statically, and the value proposer taking its key directly from the key field.
Line:112, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/AddConfigEntryDialog.java -> This adds more and more content proposal providers to the text field, which gives confusing behavior.

Open the dialog, type "core." in the key field, choose "autocrlf". TAB to the value field, type Ctrl-Space : would offer "true" and "input". Good.

Now go back to the key field. (We just realize we've chosen the wrong key.) Delete "autocrlf, type "longpaths" (or choose it from the content assist). TAB to the value field again. Invoke content assist: would propose "true". Hit ESC. Type "in": content assist previously added opens and proposes "input", which is wrong.

Thanks for that finding. I had never noticed this through my testing. I've implemented your suggestion and it works nicely now. In comparison to BranchNameNormalizer I've not hidden the content assist when no value completion is possible (due to a not recognized key), since it leads to a quite some duplicated code.
