DESCRIPTION:

Prevent the user from selecting an invalid branch/reset target.

The branch selection dialog needs to enable/disable its buttons
based on what the user has selected. This will help provide a
better user experience as they will be less likely to get into a
state where an error dialog will popup on them.

Please make sure the Change-Id is in there in the future. EGit will have a feature for this soon, but for the time being  you should install the hook (see wiki) for C git. Amending an existing commit from C git will add the change-id if the hook is installed. If you already pushed without a change-id, insert the changeid from Gerrit manually and push again.
