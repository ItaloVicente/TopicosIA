I would prefer one root Synchronize menu entry with the other options available as children. We shouldn't clutter the Team menu root as much. Other than that, this change looks awesome.

- I like this change :-)
- the dynamic menu also shows Ref for tags which don't point to 
   commits (e.g. Shawn's public GPG signing key tagged "spearce-gpg-
   pub" in egit repo), I think these should be filtered out as synchronize
   doesn't know what a public GPG key is good for
- may you could add a separator between the different Ref types in the 
   submenu

@Matthias:
* To be honest I don't know how to remove "spearce-gpg-pub" tag from this list. As far as I investigate it, this tag is also shown by `git tag` command.

* OK, this idea seam to reasonable.

@Chris:
I think that if we move all synchronize actions into separate sub menu we will loose a little bit on usability. Because to be able to launch 'Synchronize Workspace' action user need to enter sub menu with can be annoying.
