DESCRIPTION:

[historyView] Missing adapter call in command handler

The History View Command handler must properly adapt input objects
that are not IResources, otherwise a ClassCastException will be
thrown. This was reported by a colleague to happen when opening a Java
file in the history view and then trying to "Reset" onto another
commit.
Even though I couldn't reproduce this exact scenario, the code must be
fixed anyway.
