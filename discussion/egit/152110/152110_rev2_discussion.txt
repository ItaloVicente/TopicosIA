DESCRIPTION:

Cache the repository config

Many JGit operations on repositories need to get values from the
repository config. Each time, JGit check whether the config or
any of its parent config have changed and reloads them, if needed.

Even if no reload is required the mere checking whether the file
was modified can be an expensive operation, especially since it
also checks the user and system config. At least in corporate
Windows setups it's not uncommon to have the home directory actually
on a share, i.e. a network disk. In that case EGit performance
plummets; many operations and especially UI updates can become
extremely sluggish. EGit makes thousands of calls that access the
repo config, and slow access to the filesystem the user config makes
the UI barely useable.

Introduce the concept of a ConfigScope. Within a ConfigScope the git
configs for a repository are checked and possibly loaded only exactly
once, and subsequent operations work with these cached values until
the end of the scope. Such a scope is valid only for the thread that
opened it. Add a CachingRepository subclass of FileRepository that
supports this via ThreadLocals. Since the user's only way to influence
this caching is via ConfigScope, it is assured that nothing is leaked
through these ThreadLocals as long as client code uses these new
ConfigScopes as intended: always with a try-with-resource.

Use the new ConfigScope in the repository state caches, when decorating,
and when computing IndexDiffs.

How did you decide on where to add caching now? Basically I'm asking whether there is a typical pattern of code that one can easily recognize to have been cached, or did you rather log and trace, and decide based on "to many calls recorded"?
Line:87, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/CachingRepository.java -> What do you think about adding logging for !doCache and level==0? That way wrong usage of the API wouldn't go unnoticed.

Line:29, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/ConfigScope.java -> I do understand that the try-with-resource mechanism guarantees cleanup for deleting the cache. However, I find it confusing to create an object here, that I probably don't use in most of the egit operations that may appear inside the try.

I therefore typically favor lambda syntax with single method functions for such operations, like disableLoggingWhile(lambda) etc. Would that be an alternative to your current syntax suggestion? Or are there are reasons for the above syntax that I missed?

Line:153, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/RepositoryHandle.java -> I was just starting to comment that this would be more nice by having it implemented as a forwarded close() call in all subclasses of the hierarchy of the delegate, instead of doing type checks here.
But if I get it right, that would interfere with the super call in the next line, since the hierarchy of the delegate member and our hierarchy overlap. So probably nothing to improve here. :)

> How did you decide on where to add caching now?

I knew up front decorators and index diffs would be the hot spots. Other places I found by dumping stack traces when getAttributes was called on ~/.gitconfig. There's probably a few more places where ConfigScope could be used to shave off a few more such calls.
Line:87, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/CachingRepository.java -> OK, will do.

Line:29, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/ConfigScope.java -> Nice idea. Would allow to hide the ConfigScope completely, preventing potential misuses. But one would have to make sure all variables declared outside and used inside the lambda were effectively final. I'll give it a try.
