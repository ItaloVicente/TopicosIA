DESCRIPTION:

Cache the repository config

Many JGit operations on repositories need to get values from the
repository config. Each time, JGit check whether the config or
any of its parent config have changed and reloads them, if needed.

Even if no reload is required the mere checking whether the file
was modified can be an expensive operation, especially since it
also checks the user and system config. At least in corporate
Windows setups it's not uncommon to have the home directory actually
on a share, i.e. a network disk. In that case EGit performance
plummets; many operations and especially UI updates can become
extremely sluggish. EGit makes thousands of calls that access the
repo config, and slow access to the filesystem the user config makes
the UI barely useable.

Introduce the concept of a "unit of work". Within a unit of work the
git configs for a repository are checked and possibly loaded only
exactly once, and subsequent operations work with these cached values
until the end of the unit. Caching of repository configs is pre thread.

Add a CachingRepository subclass of FileRepository that supports this
via ThreadLocals. Since the user's only way to influence this caching
is via UnitOfWork, it is assured that nothing is leaked through these
ThreadLocals.

Use the new UnitOfWork in the repository state caches, when decorating,
and when computing IndexDiffs.

Line:81, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/UnitOfWork.java -> Maybe it's just confused me, but did you eventually mean to have this and the next static method named exactly the other way around? Right now static run() calls instance execute, and static execute() calls instance run.

And to avoid that confusion, would it eventually be possible to name the 2 methods identically? Or does that confuse the compiler?

BTW: The class looks even better than I had thought when describing the lambda idea.

Line:81, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/UnitOfWork.java -> I think I should just rename Work.execute() to run().

UnitOfWork.run() are the two that may propagate IOE, UnitOfWork.execute() and UnitOfWork.get() are those without exceptions.

If I rename UnitOfWork.execute() also to UnitOfWork.run(), the compiler won't know anymore which variant it should call (so it gets confused at call sites, and one couldn't use lambdas anymore but would have to use anyonymous inner classes).
