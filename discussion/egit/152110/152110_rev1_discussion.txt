DESCRIPTION:

Cache the repository config

Many JGit operations on repositories need to get values from the
repository config. Each time, JGit check whether the config or
any of its parent config have changed and reloads them, if needed.

Even if no reload is required the mere checking whether the file
was modified can be an expensive operation, especially since it
also checks the user and system config. At least in corporate
Windows setups it's not uncommon to have the home directory actually
on a share, i.e. a network disk. In that case EGit performance
plummets; many operations and especially UI updates can become
extremely sluggish. EGit makes thousands of calls that access the
repo config, and slow access to the filesystem the user config makes
the UI barely useable.

Introduce the concept of a ConfigScope. Within a ConfigScope the git
configs for a repository are checked and possibly loaded only exactly
once, and subsequent operations work with these cached values until
the end of the scope. Such a scope is valid only for the thread that
opened it. Add a CachingRepository subclass of FileRepository that
supports this via ThreadLocals. Since the user's only way to influence
this caching is via ConfigScope, it is assured that nothing is leaked
through these ThreadLocals as long as client code uses these new
ConfigScopes as intended: always with a try-with-resource.

Use the new ConfigScope in the repository state caches, when decorating,
and when computing IndexDiffs.

The problem which you want to solve is quite jgit specific. All users
of JGit (not only EGit) have this problem and maybe would like to have
such a solution. Have you thought about adding something to JGit instead of EGit? I can imagine some reasons why this would be more complex in JGit but just wanted to doublecheck.

> Have you thought about adding something to JGit instead of EGit?

I have. But:

* I want to have this in EGit 5.6.0. With the glacial pace of reviews
  in JGit (no offense meant to anyone; we're _all_ just volunteers :-)
  I could consider myself lucky if I got this into JGit before I retire.
  (Well, it's not quite _that_ bad yet... :-))
* I already have too many open changes in JGit.
* ThreadLocals may be somewhat problematic in web servers; see for
  instance bug 550529. So adding this in JGit has a somewhat higher
  risk to cause trouble in such environments, and I don't want to
  affect Gerrit.
* We can roll this out in EGit first and move it to JGit later.
