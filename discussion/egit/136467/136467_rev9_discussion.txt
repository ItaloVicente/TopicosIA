DESCRIPTION:

CommitFileDiffViewer: better performance for huge commits

Displaying the list of files changed might still freeze the UI for
really huge commits (> 10'000 changed files). Turns out that using a
SWT.VIRTUAL table is much faster for this use case.

Make the FileDiffLabelProvider safe against being passed null elements.
Improve getting icons for the FileDiffs; make sure that already the
base images are cached in the ResourceManager. Avoid using EGit's
DecorationOverlayDescriptor; it loads the base image's ImageData to
determine the size of the base image, and this loading is entirely
uncached!

In CommitFileDiffViewer, fix a number of performance problems with
selections:

* "select all" was very slow; instead of going through the content
  provider call selectAll() on the SWT table.
* ensure setSelection(StructuredSelection.EMPTY) goes through
  doDeselectAll().
* Avoid expensive preservingSelection() when the selection is huge by
  clearing it before setInput() if it's known that it cannot re-apply.
* Move the background loading out of the content provider; it confuses
  the hell out of a virtual table. Do it properly outside of any
  table-related manipulations.
