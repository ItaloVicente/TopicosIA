DESCRIPTION:

CommitFileDiffViewer: better performance for huge commits

Displaying the list of files changed might still freeze the UI for
really huge commits (> 10'000 changed files). Turns out that using a
SWT.VIRTUAL table is much faster for this use case.

Not sure if it is my workspace or the patch: on selecting a different element in the repository view previously shown file list from previously selected commit is still there.

See that too, also on Mac. The list does disappear, but it clearly stays too long. Looks like setting a null input or returning zero elements does not update the viewer, and it disappears only the next time a list of more than zero elements is set.

I also see severe performance problems when there's a large selection. Select first file, scroll down to the middle, shift-click a file there. Then try to scroll up, or click on another rep in the repository view.

On Linux it does not disappear.

Just wonder where in the patch we changed that? I don't see it. The only change is "virtual" flag and label provider. Later shouldn't be the root cause.

Can't reproduce. You mean, select many files in the commit file list?

Do we have a listener on the table somewhere, and is this listener NOT receiving some events on VIRTUAL tables?

Yep.

org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.history.GitHistoryPage.attachCommitSelectionChanged() is not notified in case of virtual table.

Uh... but this sets a listener on the graph table (unchanged) and on the comment viewer (also unchanged). Why should changing the fileViewer to virtual suppress notifications from _other_ tables?
