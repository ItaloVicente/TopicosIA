DESCRIPTION:

CommitFileDiffViewer: better performance for huge commits

Displaying the list of files changed might still freeze the UI for
really huge commits (> 10'000 changed files). Turns out that using a
SWT.VIRTUAL table is much faster for this use case.

Make the FileDiffLabelProvider safe against being passed null elements.
Improve getting icons for the FileDiffs; make sure that already the
base images are cached in the ResourceManager. Avoid using EGit's
DecorationOverlayDescriptor; it loads the base image's ImageData to
determine the size of the base image, and this loading is entirely
uncached!

In CommitFileDiffViewer, fix a number of performance problems with
selections:

* "select all" was very slow; instead of going through the content
  provider call selectAll() on the SWT table.
* ensure doSetItemCount(0) is equivalent to the faster doRemoveAll().
* ensure setSelection(StructuredSelection.EMPTY) goes through
  doDeselectAll().
* Avoid expensive preservingSelection() when the selection is huge by
  clearing it in inputChanged() if it's known that it cannot re-apply.

This looks fairly good now on CentOS 7.6, GTK 3.22.30, tested with the egit-4.6 target platform and my commit with 30'000 empty files. Might still get UI freezes when there is a large selection in the viewer, though. Now off to test this on Mac.

One problem: after a "select all" in the file viewer and then selecting another repository in the repo view, the selection is removed, but it looks like there's no selection change event, and the viewer is not updated. We'll have to find a work-around for that strange behavior.

Really looks like the virtual table doesn't send some selection change events. First selecting the huge commit, then selecting one file in there. Diff viewer (below the commit message) gets set. Now select another repo. Eventually history gets updated, but diff viewer still shows the old content. Occurs on CentOS and on OS X (10.14.2).

Otherwise the Mac seems to have no problem with "select all", but removing the selection in inputChanged() causes a brief flickering.
