DESCRIPTION:

Small performance improvement in CommitFileRevision

This is a small performance improvement in GommitFileRevision.
Re-parsing commit object isn't always necessary. In most cases RevCommit
object will have raw data loaded. Reloading commit data should only
occurs in case if there are no raw data in commit object.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:61, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/internal/storage/CommitFileRevision.java -> You shouldn't do this.  I can't promise you that parsing the body of another RevWalk's RevCommit with a new RevWalk will continue to work in the future.

If you need to ensure the buffer is parsed, you should be passing around the RevWalk that created the RevCommit you passed around, and call parseBody() on that.

parseBody() knows whether or not the buffer is loaded.  Its essentially a no-op if the buffer is already loaded.  Therefore you don't need the rc.getRawBuffer() conditional check around it.

I know we don't promise that getRawBuffer() implies the other things are accessible.  That is, just because getRawBuffer() returns non-null does not imply that getFullMessage() or getAuthorIdent() will work.  Only parseBody() promises that.
