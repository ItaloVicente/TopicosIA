DESCRIPTION:

Minor Cleanup

This is about cleaning up the anti-pattern
of constructing an Exception in a utility
method and throwing it in the code. This
will result in wrong stack traces (found
both in EGit Core and EGit UI).

Furthermore, a couple of methods were
placed in the classes that need them instead
of having them in the plug-in activator (only in
EGit UI).

A few places were marked as TODO where
an error status is created but neither logged
nor thrown as CoreException.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

Codewise this looks fine, but please separate the different kinds of changes into separate commits

E.g these three:
