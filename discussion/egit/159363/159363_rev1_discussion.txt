DESCRIPTION:

close submodules before deleting worktree

On Windows, deleting a repository containing submodules fails due to
file handles staying open. Submodules must be closed before the workTree
files are deleted.
My assumption is that otherwise the meta information about the submodule
is deleted and subRepo in RemoveCommand#closeSubmoduleRepositories is
null, so the submodule is not closed.

@Michael: If my assumption (based on some of the comments) that you also use Windows is correct, could you have a look at the two changes connected with Bug 408846 as they both attempt to solve deletion issues occurring in Windows environments.

Line:243, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/RemoveCommand.java -> Missing space.

Line:245, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/RemoveCommand.java -> This seems like a no-brainer. But I'm not sure the whole design of repository removal is entirely correct. Looks like we may be left with closed repo instances in the RepositoryCache, which might lead at least to warnings when the last reference get gc'ed. Note that at least the IndexDiffCacheEntry of repo also still has references to the submodule repos. But if this change makes deletion work on Windows in practice, all right.

Thanks for the review. Even more relevant for me (as I don't use submodules so far) is the jgit-Change (159310) for the same bug...
I'm still unsure about the protocol for reviews. What do I do, if there is no reviewer for quite some time? Do I just add someone?
Line:243, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/RemoveCommand.java -> Done

Line:245, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/RemoveCommand.java -> Indeed this is not about fixing potential Java object refernces but only about open file handles that prevented a deletion on Windows.
