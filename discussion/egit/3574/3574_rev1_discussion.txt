Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

if I use user/password authentication instead of ssh key pair with passphrase for private key I am now always asked for the password, so it seems the credentials are no longer stored in secure store

accepting this fix as a temporary solution as the other changes we proposed for completely fixing this issues need more time to finish them. We'll follow up on these after 1.0 is out.

Matthias and I proposed the changes
http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,3594 and
http://egit.eclipse.org/r/#change,3595

They should solve this issue for ssh with keypairs and for ssh with user/password. Could you have a look whether they solve this problem. Then this change can be abandoned

By "now" you mean after applaying this patch or before it?

From the other hand I would prefer to be asked always for password then to be forced to use command line git because missing passphrase for ssh key
