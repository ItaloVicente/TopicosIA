DESCRIPTION:

[repo view] Simpler refresh, better decorator setup, simpler listeners

Instead of a scheduling a job that schedules a UI refresh simply
schedule the UI refresh directly. Reduce the default delay a little.

Also, there is no need to use a new input. Refreshing the viewer will
pick up structural changes.

The lightweight decorator was setup in a somewhat non-standard way
not really supported by the CNF. Use a simple non-decorating label
provider in the view, and let the framework do all the decorating.

This has multiple advantages: there's no flickering on refreshes. Icon
decorations can finally be done in the lightweight decorator. This also
brings back the gitflow icon overlay. And there's no longer a need for
caching "last used" labels to avoid flickering in text decorations.

However, out of the box the framework does not support having label
text after the decoration. Add special-case handling for updating
a ViewerCell and add the directories of repositories and working trees
only then. If this were done in getStyledText() of the label provider,
the directories would appear before the decoration.

Note that both the simpler refresh and the lightweight decorator setup
belong together. Doing only one or the other leads to flickering on
refresh.

Use lambdas for listeners.

Line:921, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> Doesn't that mean, that the job never starts if events are coming in every 200 ms (less than the 300 ms schedule delay)? An alternative would be to remember the time the job finished during last run, and to schedule the next with a delay of max(0, now-last_finish_time + 300). That way events could not defer jobs endlessly, and they would still not run more often than 300 ms.

I'm not sure if it was egit or another project, where we recently discussed re-using job instances versus creating new job instances. But I remember that we had an issue that resulted from setting a member to prepare the next scheduling, while that same job was still running on the previous schedule. By creating a new job instance every time that became a no-issue. Wondering if we should do that here, too.

Line:921, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> Good suggestion, simply re-scheduling would work only if there was no cancel().

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:921, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> I went with removing the cancel(). With the decorator in the background, I'm not sure all this background refresh is still needed at all. Without the cancel, we have either:

* No job is running. schedule(delay) is called, job is waiting.
* Job is waiting and schedule(delay) is called: is ignored.
* Job is running and schedule(delay) is called: job will be re-scheduled with the delay of the last schedule() while it was running.

Which gives us exactly what we want.
