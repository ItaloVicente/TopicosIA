DESCRIPTION:

CommitDialog: improve sorting of file list

This initially sorts the file list by status and path. When clicking
on either the status or file column header, the list is re-sorted
according to the clicked column ascending. The second click on the
same column header re-sorts according to the clicked column
descending. The third click on the same column reverts the original
sorting (by status and path).

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I would prefer if the sort by path would include the project name, it looks odd if files are sorted just by file path relative to their project
