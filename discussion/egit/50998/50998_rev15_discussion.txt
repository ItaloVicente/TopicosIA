DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Added support for external diff and merge tools in EGit.

* added support for git mergetool
  * see: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool
  * new Git-Preferences in merge-group:
    * Merge tool to use:
      * Use Eclipse compare editor
      * Use default git merge tool
      * Use custom git merge tool
    * Custom merge tool: <toolname>
  * supported user config settings
    * merge.tool
    * mergetool.<tool>.path
    * mergetool.<tool>.cmd
    * mergetool.prompt
    * mergetool.trustExitCode
    * mergetool.writeToTemp
    * mergetool.keepTemporaries

* added support for git difftool (from user config)
  * see: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool
  * new Git-Preferences in diff-group:
    * Diff tool to use:
      * Use Eclipse compare editor
      * Use default git diff tool
      * Use custom git diff tool
    * Custom diff tool: <toolname>
    * Bash path: <the path to bash> [only for windows, to be discussed]
  * supported user config settings
    * diff.tool
    * difftool.<tool>.path
    * difftool.<tool>.cmd
    * difftool.prompt
    * difftool.trustExitCode
    * difftool.writeToTemp [like mergetool, not seen in C-Git]
    * difftool.keepTemporaries [like mergetool, not seen in C-Git]

fixed too:
  * Show message about failed tool execution to user
  * Added embedded diff/merge tool definitions like known in C-Git
  * Added support for tool option without $BASE file
  * Add external merged file to the index (after a successful merge
only)
  * Added setting to Git preferences to enable or disable "Add external
merged file to the index (after a successful merge only)"
  * Added working directory for external tool call

TODOs:
  * move the whole external tools code to JGit
    * see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=356832#c12
  * merge.keepBackup
  * [to be discussed]: i've added execution of external tools for bash
    (msys) for windows, to support execution of bash scripts under
windows,
    may be it should be removed and/or enabled only for windows...

This is a rebase made by Tim on current HEAD, no other functional changes, just fixing some conflicts/renames etc.

Tim plans to look at this patch and follow up on proposed changes.

I've found the following problems with the current state:
  * While the external diff viewer is open, the eclipse UI is _completely_ frozen
  * For the files I tested with the path given to the external diff viewer is wrong (contains a double quote).

I have no access to my private computer now, but will push the first step of JGit integration as new chnange tonight. It's far away from finished. I have very limited time for future improvements and hope you can review or create a better solution by yourself.

As i've already wrote in the comments this change should be abandoned after integration of the code to JGit. The UI / EGit part have to be rewritten anyway for use he JGit API.

The UI freeze is known, but it was ok for our developers. They use it as mergetool and during a merge conflict resolving you do not want to work with something in parallel. But this should be implemented without blocking the UI, e.g. for difftool you want to see diff in external tool and still work with Eclipse.

>   * For the files I tested with the path given to the external diff viewer is wrong (contains a double quote).

We are wotking at Windows with kdiff3, Meld, SourceGear DiffMerge, Beyond Compare 3/4 and IBM Rational Rhapsody DiffMerge. The same configuration works with "Git for Windows" in the bash shell and Eclipse as "git difftool" and "git mergetool". I'm working at Linux (Debian and Arch) at home with meld. Please give some more information about you enviroment.

I've prepared the change for JGit and started to split it in smaller peaces for 
review. Now i'm facing problems after the split and rebasing to latest master and hope to find solutions today. The roadmap with smaller changes is:
- "jgit difftool" command line (pgm) --> DONE
- read difftool config --> compile errors --> investigating
- execute difftool --> ongoing
- "jgit mergetool" command line (pgm) --> DONE
- read mergetool config --> compile errors --> investigating
- execute mergetool --> ongoing
- EGit integration (UI) --> not started

Great. Thanks for your time.

Please note, even if you have no time to finish everything, it would be very beneficial to have your current work pushed to Gerrit, so Tim could take over instead of reinventing the wheel.
