DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Added support for external diff and merge tools in EGit.

* added support for git mergetool
  * see: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-mergetool
  * new Git-Preferences in merge-group:
    * Merge tool to use:
      * Use Eclipse compare editor
      * Use default git merge tool
      * Use custom git merge tool
    * Custom merge tool: <toolname>
  * supported user config settings
    * merge.tool
    * mergetool.<tool>.path
    * mergetool.<tool>.cmd
    * mergetool.prompt
    * mergetool.trustExitCode
    * mergetool.writeToTemp
    * mergetool.keepTemporaries

* added support for git difftool (from user config)
  * see: http://git-scm.com/docs/git-difftool
  * new Git-Preferences in diff-group:
    * Diff tool to use:
      * Use Eclipse compare editor
      * Use default git diff tool
      * Use custom git diff tool
    * Custom diff tool: <toolname>
    * Bash path: <the path to bash> [only for windows, to be discussed]
  * supported user config settings
    * diff.tool
    * difftool.<tool>.path
    * difftool.<tool>.cmd
    * difftool.prompt
    * difftool.trustExitCode
    * difftool.writeToTemp [like mergetool, not seen in C-Git]
    * difftool.keepTemporaries [like mergetool, not seen in C-Git]

fixed too:
  * Show message about failed tool execution to user
  * Added embedded diff/merge tool definitions like known in C-Git
  * Added support for tool option without $BASE file
  * Add external merged file to the index (after a successful merge
only)
  * Added setting to Git preferences to enable or disable "Add external
merged file to the index (after a successful merge only)"
  * Added working directory for external tool call

TODOs:
  * move the whole external tools code to JGit
    * see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=356832#c12
  * merge.keepBackup
  * [to be discussed]: i've added execution of external tools for bash
    (msys) for windows, to support execution of bash scripts under
windows,
    may be it should be removed and/or enabled only for windows...

Patch Set 13:

I'm wondering if also other people would like to have a 4th option in the merge tool selection: Always ask. Basically I'm completely happy with almost always using the Eclipse internal diff, but just sometimes I would like to use Beyond Compare instead.

However, I'm not sure if it is worth the effort to investigate this _now_. It is probably better to just get the current implementation stable and test drive it for a while, to see if I would still have that need or not.

I think you are talking about the EGit usability, so to have an option "Always ask" before starting internal or external diff/mergetool? I think it would be good. For you information this change will not be merged soon, because the whole logic without the UI code will be implemented / moved to JGit and then i will reuse this or create new change for EGit UI integration based at JGit API. I've just rebased it to check if it still works with EGit 5.x... i hope to continue with this after git worktree is finished in next weeks...
