DESCRIPTION:

Fix exception handling in MergeOperation

MergeOperation was catching specific exceptions when using the
merge commands. There is also a generic parent exception of all
exceptions thrown by this command. We should also catch the
generic exception and return an error. That way jgit can introduce
new exceptions without breaking the build of egit.
