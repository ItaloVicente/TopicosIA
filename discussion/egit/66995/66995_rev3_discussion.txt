DESCRIPTION:

Test stability investigation: GitSubscriberMergeContextTest

I can't get that test to fail locally; neither on native OS X nor on a
Linux (Ubuntu 15.04) VM. Yet it fails frequently on Hudson. I don't see
anything wrong with the test either. Let's include a lot of debug output
in an attempt to figure out what's going on.

I suggest we do actually merge this, so that we have the extra info the
next time it fails. Hopefully that'll give some hints.

I couldn't find a thread dump method anywhere, so I wrote my own.
