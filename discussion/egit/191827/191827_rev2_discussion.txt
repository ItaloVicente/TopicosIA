DESCRIPTION:

Fix blocking during branch rename

The BranchRenameDialog must return successfully only once the branch
has been renamed, so just using a job is not feasible.

Blocking could occur because the RenameBranchOperation actually ran
as an IWorkspaceRunnable with a scheduling rule. Neither is necessary,
though, as this is pure repository operation.

Remove the workspace stuff and perform the git operation directly.
The git operation itself should run fairly quickly, and is not
cancellable once begun, so adding some progress monitor in the UI
is not necessary.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Sorry for being late with this question. Is not using any kind of scheduling rule really correct here? I'm not an expert of the jgit internals, but my naive thinking says that "fetch from upstream" and "rename branch" should not run in parallel, since the first might try to create new files in the current branch (and in the refs directory), while the second is trying to rename the same refs directory. On my Windows machine (with bad git performance due to company anti virus) I regularly have waiting tasks like described in my progress view, and those are currently running one after the other, not concurrently.
I agree that the workspace job is not necessary.
