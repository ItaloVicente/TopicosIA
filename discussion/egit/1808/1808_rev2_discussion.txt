DESCRIPTION:

AdaptableFileTreeIterator: handling of nested / closed projects

In case of nested projects AdaptableFileTreeIterator finds
more than one container for a given file. The old implementation just
took the first found container. This could cause problems if the
container is not accessible (project closed). The new implementation
does the following:
1. Non accessible containers are excluded
2. The remaining containers are checked if they reside in a project
shared with Git. The first matching container is chosen.
Furthermore container lookup was improved. In the past the
IndexDiff of CommitActionHandler always started with an 
AdaptableFileTreeIterator. This was not correct if the Git repository root
was an Eclipse project and caused the problem that derived files in the
project folder were shown in the Commit dialog.
