DESCRIPTION:

Allow preselection in branch selection dialog to enable OK button

In the reset branch selection dialog, the OK button was not enabled when
initially showing the dialog, even though all the user inputs were
already complete. Because of this, the user needed to select the already
selected branch again, to make it possible to press on the OK button.

looks like this breaks the test CompareActionsTest.testCompareWithRef() 
so this test probably needs to be adapted for this change
