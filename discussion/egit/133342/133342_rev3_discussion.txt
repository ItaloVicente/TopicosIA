Thomas, I updated the other target platforms. However, I wasn't expecting it. This introduces the risk of bringing 2018-12 Orbit dependencies into older Eclipse installations. This can cause unexpected runtime issues because of duplicate bundles and/or involuntary down-/upgrades.

Can you discuss this with Matthias? For EGit at least we build with the egit-4.6 target (it's the oldest target on which the smartimport builds; EGit is supposed to run on Eclipse Mars, so egit-4.5 would be even more correct). I usually use that target in my dev workspace, too. I think if we don't update the old targets, we won't be able to build.

Updating all targets is correct, and we did that for all Orbit changes in the past.

Generally that is a rather safe thing to my mind:
* Orbit dependencies in the TPD have a fixed version. They do NOT upgrade silently when changing the Orbit URL.
* Orbit dependency versions are only upgraded in case of necessity (in egit). So we don't automatically include the "latest stuff".
* All the dependencies from Orbit that we rely on are bundled in the egit features (and not looked up from referred update sites), so we know the development version is the installation version.
* Since they are included in the features, they are checked by P2 during installation time.

That all being said, you are of course right that this still needs intensive testing for compatibility.
