DESCRIPTION:

Staging view: don't clear title RepositoryNode

This node may end up being referenced elsewhere, for instance in
the repositories view. If it's nulled out, the repositories view
will then have a node with a null repository, which breaks all
subsequent operations on that node.

To avoid similar bugs in the future, wouldn't it be more clear to get rid of the RepositoryTreeNode completely and to call GitLabels.getStyledLabelExtendedSafe(repo) directly?

That's what we used to do (using getStyledLabelSafe though: no working tree path), but then the branch status is calculated on the UI thread. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/134020/ .

I still haven't made up my mind whether this is actually a bug in AbstractTreeViewer.associate(). There's a comment there that linking foreign objects into the viewers tree was done because of bug "PR 1FV62BT" -- no idea where I could find out what that was. The code dates back to before 2002...

I'd rather get rid of RepositoryTreeNode<?> completely. Is there a real need for a separate "view model"? Why do we have a RepositoryNode at all? Couldn't we use the Repository object directly? And for the "virtual" structuring nodes ("Branches", "Remotes", branch hierarchy, ...), there are mechanisms to provide those. After all the package/project explorers also can show virtual things, like "Plugin dependencies", Java packages, "Maven dependencies", and other things.

But changing that would be *major* undertaking. Maybe one day if I'm terminally bored I might try it.

In fact, that's maybe not such a good idea. Some parts of Eclipse cache last selections (for instance the CommonNavigator, or the WorkbenchSourceProvider), so if we used Repository directly, the framework would hold onto Repository instances longer than expected. With RepositoryTreeNode, it'll only hold on to that node, but we can clear the reference to the Repository. So if one wanted to remove the RepositoryTreeNode hierarchy completely it would have to be done very carefully and might give surprising side effects.
