DESCRIPTION:

Add .gitignore capabilities to EGit

Adds .gitignore capabilities to EGit. The ignore cache is
initialized once fully on creation, then updated via an
IResourceChangeListener from then on. Updating is coupled to
GitLightweightDecorator, which already does a check for changes
to .gitignore files.

I think we should put the cache completely to JGit. In my opinion it belongs to the JGit Repository class.

In EGit we make use of the JGit API commands in package org.eclipse.jgit.api. The EGit Track Operation will soon just call an "Add"-command in this JGit API. Now this "Add"-Command will have to know the ignored resources.

For an explanation of the planned usage of the "add" command please have a look at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=315306.

Patch Set 5:

Fully initializes the cache's ignore map once upon creation. Afterwards, listens for changes to .gitignore files, and updates when needed. Does not parse ignore files until they are needed. 

Is this the direction that EGit wants to take with .gitignore? Attached patch works with IgnoreAction. If a gitignore file is modified from commandline, it will need to be refreshed before the changes are noticed.

I am currently working on automated tests, and then will add modifications to also listen to updates to the .git/info/exclude file.
