DESCRIPTION:

[historyView] Show all differing files in details area

Previously the files list was filtered by the selected
paths.  This can lead to confusion when selecting to cherry
pick a commit and assuming only the files listed will be
changed but instead files filtered from view are also included.

Bug: 360073

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

With this change the file list will display all files which were changed between the selected commit and its parent in the *filtered* view. This is not what the user would expect, and not what the reporter of the bug suggested.

I guess that the suggested solution would be more complicated because you would somehow have to retrieve the real parent additionally to the one from the filtered walk.
