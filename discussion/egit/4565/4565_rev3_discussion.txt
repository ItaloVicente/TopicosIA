DESCRIPTION:

[historyView] Show all differing files in details area

Previously the files list was filtered by the selected
paths.  This can lead to confusion when selecting to cherry
pick a commit and assuming only the files listed will be
changed but instead files filtered from view are also included.

Works well when there is no rename.

When there is a rename, the TreeFilter is replaced in GitHistoryPage.updateFollowFilter and only the renamed file is shown in the file list.

Maybe this method is not needed anymore at all because now all the files are shown. Then all the great work done in JGits commit 98d4bd6d36d98940f5fd0b6a3e20147cb96903c0 and the FollowingFilter would not be used anymore...
