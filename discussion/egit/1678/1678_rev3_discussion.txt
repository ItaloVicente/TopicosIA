DESCRIPTION:

CreateTagDialog: improve UI Responsiveness

This improves UI responsiveness of the CreateTagDialog by filling the
"Existing Tags" list asynchronously and by filling the "Commit" combo
box lazily when opening the "Advanced" section.
While the tag list is filled, a "Loading..." node is shown instead and the
list is inactive. Still it is possible to use the dialog while the list is filled.
In addition, the content provider for the tag list was changed to a simple
ArrayContentProvider which saves some extra overhead.
