Uploaded patch set 2.
Line:1, org.eclipse.egit-feature/.gitignore -> FYI, I usually prefer to write these as /target, so they aren't considered below the top level directory.  When ignoring files in Git I try to be as specific as I can, so we don't accidentally ignore a package whose name is "org.eclipse.egit.ui.target" or something like that.
