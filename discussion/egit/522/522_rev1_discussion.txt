I would rather have the branch at the beginning and the repo afterwards - the branch is what interest me more most of the time.

I also do not like the - as separator, it is not intuitively clear that it separates two different entities. How about braces for the repo: [branch (repo)]?

Plase Use some other separator. Dashes are sometimes used in repository names.

A blank would be fine as that is rarely, if ever, used as in a project or branch name. (Currently Git does not allow blanks in branch names).
