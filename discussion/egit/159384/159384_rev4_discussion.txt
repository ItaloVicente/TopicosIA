Line:88, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/SourceBranchPage.java -> Typo.

Line:249, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/SourceBranchPage.java -> This gives a fairly large group with three radio buttons. Would a drop-down combo look better?

Line:258, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/SourceBranchPage.java -> The messages are a bit strange. First, who is "we"? Second, since the repo isn't cloned yet, of course it doesn't have anything yet. Third, I believe this applies to all tags, not just annotated tags.

If you are not generally opposed to the feature, layout and texts can be adapted.
Line:249, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/SourceBranchPage.java -> The code is basically the same as in the advanced fetch configuration - same layout, same texts. a) For the initial functional review, b) so users can easily recognize that they configure the same thing

Line:258, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/SourceBranchPage.java -> I must admit, I did not pay close attention to the actual texts. For the above mentioned reasons, I reused everything.

Of course not! It does make sense to give the user a way to specify the tag fetch option in the UI.

It's a fairly advanced feature, though; I doubt many people will change it from the default. In fact, there was a suggestion somewhere to allow skipping this page altogether... ah yes, it's bug 502558.

I am with Karsten here, allow finish on the first page (if the target location does not exist already). I would implement this in a separate change, though.
Line:88, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/SourceBranchPage.java -> Done

Line:249, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/SourceBranchPage.java -> I'd like to keep radio buttons. A drop-down would require less space, but the user can't see all options at once and would have to click twice instead of once to change the option.

How about very short texts and tooltip explanations. Basically you could almost show the enum-value "auto-follow", "all tags", "no tags".

Line:258, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/SourceBranchPage.java -> As mentioned before, layout and texts are taken from the Fetch Ref Specifications page (Configure Fetch... -> Advanced). My feeling is that if we change the texts here, they should also be changed on that page.

Line:249, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/SourceBranchPage.java -> OK, let's keep it.

No, I wouldn't show the enum values only. So keep as is. Maybe this whole page needs to be refactored. By default, all branches are fetched, so I don't think there's any difference between "auto-follow" and "all tags".

If I understand correctly, you'd be OK with PS 4 if the typo is fixed.
Line:249, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/clone/SourceBranchPage.java -> There is a difference between "auto-follow" and "all tags" - see the original bug report. Auto-follow will only fetch tags that are "on" the selected branches and tags may exist that are not on any existing branch.
