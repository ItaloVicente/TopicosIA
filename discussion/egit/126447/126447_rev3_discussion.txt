DESCRIPTION:

History table: let the user define which columns are shown

Columns in tables cannot be shown/hidden individually. But we can
set the width to zero to hide a column. Of course the user can hide
and restore columns directly by dragging the column separators, too.

Add a "Columns" sub-menu in the view menu where the user can check
the columns to be shown/hidden. These modifications are transient;
they are not saved or restored when the view is closed or opened,
and they do not survive across and IDE restart. This is similar to
the "pinned" state of a history view.

To permanently change which columns are shown by default, there's
a new preference page.

@Michael: could you please verify this works on Windows? It does on OS X and gtk, but I don't know whether Windows can deal with zero-width columns.

Works fine. I'm not sure if it is a good idea to have this setting selectively per view instance and decoupled from the preference pages, even though it was requested that way in the bug tracker.
I already foresee the bug reports stating that the selection from the view menu is forgotten on restart. I would go with just a single set of preference values (i.e. view menu and preferences are identical).
Line:577, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> last time you reminded me of the 3 blanks indentation ;)

Line:51, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/HistoryColumnsPreferencePage.java -> please remove the label and call setDescription() in the constructor instead.

Line:732, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> -Define +Select

I agree to Michael, one set of persisted preferences seems sufficient

I disagree. The user can achieve the same effect by resizing columns manually to width zero. It would be rather strange if the view menu action then were still checked (because the preference would remain unchanged). Making manual resizing of columns affect the preferences would be strange, too. Just because I right now don't want to see a column doesn't mean I want to change my preferences and never see that column again by default.
