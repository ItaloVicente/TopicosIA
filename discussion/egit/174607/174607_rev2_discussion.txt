DESCRIPTION:

[tag properties] Show full message in a pop-up

Show the full message of a tag or commit in the properties view in
an IInformationControl when the property is selected, similar to the
information hover pop-ups in text editors.

The IInformationControl framework from JFace needs quite a bit of setup,
though. Although the JFace support is prepared for being used with
arbitrary controls, the Eclipse platform provides only built-in support
for text editors.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> information hove pop-ups in the Java editor do not require to select text but only to hover over the text for a while, I expected the same behaviour here

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> That would be a rather different implementation.

I'm not sure a hover could be implemented, though. While it should be possible to track mouse movements in the Tree and identify the TreeItem, the PropertySheetEntry obtainable via item.getData() does not give access to the PropertyDescriptor. So it's not clear to me how to figure out that the mouse pointer is over an item for a MessagePropertyDescriptor and that a hover should be shown. Maybe if we built our own model using a subclass of PropertySheetEntry that would make PropertySheetEntry.getDescriptor() public... (and override createChildEntry(), too).

The user would have to give the tree in the properties view the focus first anyway (activate the view).

For keyboard navigation, the user would then have to navigate to the line anyway and then hit F2. Now he has to navigate to the line and hit <return> to open the CellEditor.

For mouse navigation, there's one click to activate the view, then there'd be a mouse move to the item. Now there is a click to activate, then a mouse move and another click. I suspect most of the time the user would click to activate on the item anyway.

Maybe I have some more time to give it a try. But it doesn't seem to be any simpler to implement.

This is possible, but because InformationControlReplacer is internal and the methods on AbstractInformationControlManager to work with such an InformationControlReplacer are package-visible only and not accessible to EGit, hovers can be focused only via F2, and only when the properties view is active. Working around these framework limitations would require copying an inane amount of code from JFace and modifying it. Without that it's not really any more comfortable. (In fact, not being able to focus a popup with the mouse is a bloody nuisance.)
