DESCRIPTION:

Do not eagerly schedule refresh of the 'Repositories' view

The view was originally refreshing its contents even when the user did not actually perform any action in the wizard. The code now checks to ensure that the user actually confirmed the operation before scheduling a refresh.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Sorry, I forgot that EGit ignores selection (bug 304131). So it looks like this includes a plugin.xml change.
