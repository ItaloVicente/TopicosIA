DESCRIPTION:

Bug 537542 - Open compare editor from pull result dialog

Additionally to opening the commit viewer for double click on a commit
we now open a compare editor for file diffs when double clicking a
changed file.

I made a former package protected method publicly available to have as
little diff as possible, but core developers can probably judge better
whether that entry point for diffs should be moved.

Also the method for opening the compare editor checks that the diff has
only 2 ancestors and shows a message dialog otherwise. Inside of the
compare method however, dealing with more than 2 ancestors seems fine
(e.g. accessing blobs by blobs[length -1] etc.). Can the message dialog
be removed?

It would be really cool if we had additionally a little context menu on these commits and file diffs with those operations available. I had never noticed that I could open a fetched commit by double-clicking...! Perhaps add that in a follow-up commit. Ctrl/Cmd-C (Copy) of selected items (copying the selected label texts to the clipboard) would also be nice to have.

In general the discoverability of such operations in dialogs is a bit of a problem. Even with a context menu a user has no indication that such a thing would be available. I don't have a bright idea how to improve that... The help on that dialog is also not exactly helpful; it goes to some very generic Eclipse help page. (But that's an entirely different topic. In general the help system of EGit is woefully underdeveloped.)
Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> Possibly it would be OK to just call DiffViewer.showTwoWayFileDiff() directly, and get rid of CommitFileDiffViewer.showTwoWayFileDiff() altogether. For merge commits the diffs shown are those for which the new file differs from _all_ parents. Showing the diff against the first parent is probably what most users would expect anyway.

It is in any case strange to be shown some file diffs and have the option to show the diff only to get a message dialog informing one that EGit cannot do the operation. Moreover the message text is strange: "This is a merge commit with more than one ancestor." -- can there be merge commits with only one ancestor??

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> style nit: we don't add the bug id to the subject but add it to the footer (last paragraph of the commit message) like this

Bug: 537542

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> yes, this should be fixed

Gerrit shows only conflict resolutions in the diff for merge commits by re-merging the two commits the merge commit merged transiently and comparing that against the merge commit in the history. If this yields a difference a conflict resolution was done.
