Verified that the image is displayed in both context menus.
Line:144, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/HeaderText.java -> Wouldn't it be worth creating a LocalResourceManager in this class as well, to avoid creating duplicate instances of the icon for each editor?

Line:144, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/HeaderText.java -> That sounds perfectly reasonable (and I was not even aware of this aspect of creating many images). However, for using a LocalResourceManager I would need some hook to dispose that, right? This class is not derived from controls or widgets, therefore there is no dispose() method. I guess that's the reason why another image is also registered via the utility class in line 103.

If you have some advice how to use a LocalResourceManager under those circumstances, I'm happy to change the code. I just don't know how to make it work.

I believe either passing the resource manager as a parameter to  HeaderText/CommitPage, or delegating the dispose()-call to HeaderText would be viable. The second option would mean that there are still two instances of the image, though. Hence I would prefer the first, if it works.

On second thought: Since the resources are reference counted, it should be fine if each class keeps their own LocalResourceManager as long as they have same parent. The dispose()-call still needs to be delegated.
