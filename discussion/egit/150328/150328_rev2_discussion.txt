DESCRIPTION:

Introduce repository groups to Repositories View

In order to allow the user to structure repositories a new node type
'group' is introduced. Groups can be created, renamed and deleted. If a
repository belongs to a group, it is not shown in the tree root.
Assignment is done by having repositories selected while creating the
group or by drag/drop.

Looks rather good already.

Drag'n'drop:
* I can drag a repo into a group, but not out of it.
* Dragging a repo into a group (or out of it) should reveal the dragged repo.
* Dragging repo groups should not be allowed; I couldn't find any place to drop it. (May be unrelated to this change, I can also drag other nodes, but not drop them anywhere. Can be fixed in a follow-up commit.)

Status line:
* Shows "[]" after the group name.

Context menu:
* "Add repo group" should be available when a repo group is selected.
* When more than one repo group is selected, the "Delete Repository Group" menu item should use plural. Maybe "Delete Repository Groups" should then also open a dialog asking for confirmation (and showing the groups that will be removed)?

Context menu needs improvements in a follow-up commit:
* On a repo already in a repo group, should have a "Move to repository group..." item, not "Add repository group". Should open a dialog allowing to select an existing group, or create a new one. (Haven't looked yet at your follow-up commit for configuring the groups.)
* On a repo not yet in a repo group, I'd expect a "Add to repository group..." item; same dialog.

Patch Set 2:

Thanks for the very detailed comments. I will address them over the next couple of days (try to fix them or reply to the comments inline). Regarding the general comments:

Drag'n'Drop:
* You can drop the repository to the tree root - which basically is the white area below the last item in the view.
* I'll try to see what I can do about revealing the dropped element... You can drop several repositories at once, as the parent changes, equals and hashcode change, so the hard part will be identifying the elements after the drop. Would opening the target (group) be enough?
* I tried not to change anything about the existing drag'n'drop functionality. It is already the case, that you can drag *any* node from the view, even if there is no valid target (e.g. a remotes node).

Status line: I have to find out, where that comes from.

Context menu:
* (I'll have to find out how to check the parent of a selection in the plugin.xml, no idea so far)
* As nested groups are not supported, I left the item out (add group when group is selected). Adding it is no problem, but the semantics should not be "move all repositories from the selected groups to a newly created one!?
* :-( Remove "Repository from View" is not plural either if more than one is selected. As the action affects *only* the *structure* of the view and not the content itself, do you think a confirmation dialog is really necessary? A group is very easily created again.

Context menu follow-ups:
One could argue that for a very first step (gathering user feedback on this feature), adding a repository group from the view's menu could be enough and re-arranging the structure via drag'n'drop suffices. There is no end to the potential complexity for the context menu entries. So for a repo already in a group you could have "Remove from current group", "Move to other existing group", "Move to completely new group".
For me as a user an elaborate "Manage Repository Groups" dialog would be overkill. Once I understand that drag'n'drop works, it is all I need.

Note: the follow-up-commit only adds a "hide group" functionality, i.e. you can mark groups and then customize the view filter to not show the marked groups. It does not change the "arrang repos in groups" actions.

I don't have such an area in my view :-) Would have to make the view really large. (Yes, I do have many repositories in my repo view.)

Revealing the first one should be good enough. But if too complicated, just leave as is; this can always be improved in a later commit.

Ack. General problem; should be fixed in an independent commit.

RepositoryTreeNodeLabelProvider.getDescription()

Might need a property tester.

Ok, hadn't thought about nested groups. Agree that showing the "Add" menu entry on repo groups might make the user think it was about nesting. But then it probably should be available only on top-level repos.

Plural: Ok, let's ignore that for the time being. To be fixed later.

Re: creation of group is easy: yes, but then you'd have to re-add all repos again.

Initially I wondered if the existing IWorkingSet could be re-used for repository groups.
Working Sets give exactly this kind of configuration, in addition to DnD. That's where this idea comes from.

I agree it'd be overkill for a first version. I _did_ write it was something for a follow-up commit :-)
