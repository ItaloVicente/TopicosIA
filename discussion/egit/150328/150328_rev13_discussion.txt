DESCRIPTION:

[repo view] Introduce repository groups

In order to allow the user to structure repositories a new node type
'group' is introduced. A repository may belong to at most one group.
Groups can be created, renamed and deleted; they cannot be nested. If a
repository belongs to a group, it is not shown in the tree root.
Assignment is done by having repositories selected while creating the
group, by drag/drop or via a new context menu entry.

I had that idea, too, but thought it was something for a follow-up change.
Can be improved further in a follow-up commit: on Working Sets in the package explorer, we show "[* branch]" if the working set contains projects from several repos all on the same branch. For repo groups that have more than one repo we could also show this asterisk.

 > I hope, these additional (non-)changes are OK.

Sure.

Now we'll just have to wait for the CQ.

There's something mighty strange going on between the staging view and the repo view. The staging view creates a RepositoryNode for its title, and nulls that node out via clear() when it no longer needs it. But somehow that very node instance ends up in the repo view tree?!

So as long as one only selects repositories in the repo view (with staging set to follow the selection) everything's fine. But as soon as one selects a repo group, the staging view gets a null repo, discards and clears its title node, and since that same instance somehow is also referenced in the repo view's tree, we now have a repo node with a null repo in the repo view, which leads to numerous problems.

Something's really fishy.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Start Eclipse. Mine has both repo view and staging view visible, staging view set to follow selection, repo view not.
2. I have multiple repos in the repo view, and some groups.
3. Click on a repo. Staging view updates.
4. Click on a repo group. Staging view updates, clears and says "No repository".
5. Click on the same repo as in step 3.

Expected: staging view updates and shows the repo name in its title.

Actual: since the node clicked in step 5 has myRepository == null (cleared by the staging view in step 4 since somehow it's the same instance), nothing happens. Git operations on that node are broken and cause exceptions.

How the heck does the staging view's RepositoryNode end up in the tree in the repo view?

@Alexander: can you reproduce?

(I discovered that in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/151813/ and thought I had broken it somehow, but it already occurs in this version.)

Occurs on two different computers for me (both with a child Eclipse using the Neon target). So it's not a corrupted workspace.

To be clear: I don't think this instance sharing is introduced by this change. It probably happened before, but we never had a RepositoryTreeNode with a null repository until this change, and so this never caused problems. Of course it could be "fixed" in staging view in several ways (not reacting on the selection if repo == null, or not clearing its titleNode), but that doesn't solve the fundamental problem: why does that titleNode end up being referenced from the repo view's tree?? That should just not happen!

OK, found it: bug 552622. Nasty. Probably undetected until now because it's actually difficult to give the staging view a null repository so that it would clear out its titleNode. Apparently nobody ever closes the staging view :-), because then it also clears that node and one has the same problems. Even without this change.

With this change it's become super-easy to give the staging view a null repo and make it clear its titleNode: just select a repo group.

I'm still fine with this change. I'll push a fix for bug 552622, and then I'll rebase this whole sequence to pick up this fairly crucial fix.
