DESCRIPTION:

Introduce repository groups to Repositories View

In order to allow the user to structure repositories a new node type
'group' is introduced. Groups can be created, renamed and deleted. If a
repository belongs to a group, it is not shown in the tree root.
Assignment is done by having repositories selected while creating the
group, by drag/drop or via a new context menu entry.

I was just wondering if you have a feeling about how close we are to the finish line.

Close. I just want to test once again after the relative path changes. Then I'll file the CQ (required for changes over 1000 added lines by contributors), and then we can submit it once the CQ has been approved by the Eclipse legal team.

I think it's very nice work, BTW.

Just some nitpicks. I've created CQ 21019 to get this approved by the legal team. Please include the footer line

  CQ: 21019

in the commit message above the "Bug:" line.
Line:70, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/actions/RepositoryGroupsMenu.java -> If the selected repos are all from the same group, that group could be excluded here. Otherwise if I select a repo inside group "Foo" the menu will still show "Move to 'Foo'". Even if that's the only existing group.

Line:718, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> When "link with selection" is on, this won't find repositories inside groups. Don't bother with it; is going to be fixed in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/151302/ , which will be merged earlier, and then we'll pick it up here via the rebase.

Line:183, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoryTreeNodeLabelProvider.java -> Could use append(')') here; avoids the need for the NON-NLS.

Line:76, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/DeleteRepositoryGroupConfirmDialog.java -> I'd use

  new RepositoryTreeNodeLabelProvider()

OK, we'll lose the gitflow decorator, but we'll get styled labels and be consistent with the rest of EGit. (And if we ever fix that blinking problem, we'll automatically have the gitflow decorator back, too.)

I have made the changes (and slightly changed the commit comment). Happy to be almost done.
Line:718, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> Have you tried it? At least in the current state, with link selection enabled, repositories and working tree children are opened also in groups (in my setup=.

Line:76, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/tree/command/DeleteRepositoryGroupConfirmDialog.java -> OK, done. However, DeleteRepositoryConfirmDialog uses this provider, too.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:718, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> Yes, I did. It works for files. It doesn't work for repositories. (Quite evidently, since this code here doesn't descend into groups.) To reproduce: have git repo and history view open. Select a top-level repo in the repo view, let the history show. In the history view's toolbar, switch to a repo in a group via the "repo switch" toolbar button's drop-down menu.

Actual: repo view doesn't select the repo now shown in the history view.

Expected: repo view expands the group node and selects the repo inside.

Should work once this is rebased onto 67a046c.
