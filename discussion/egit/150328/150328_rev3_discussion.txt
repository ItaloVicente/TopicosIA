DESCRIPTION:

Introduce repository groups to Repositories View

In order to allow the user to structure repositories a new node type
'group' is introduced. Groups can be created, renamed and deleted. If a
repository belongs to a group, it is not shown in the tree root.
Assignment is done by having repositories selected while creating the
group or by drag/drop.

As there were so many comments, I wanted split the patch. I think that I have dealt with everything but the plugin.xml (default handler etc. which is the must difficult for me) and the image file (which I don't know how to deal with).

I don't know if it is a problem, that I rebased on master, hopefully not.

With respect to drag'n'drop. Even if there are many repositories (or the view is very small), (for me) there is always a very small area after the last element of the tree. I can drop a repository from a group there.

I am still not sure about showing a repository on drop. The current behaviour seems to be consistent with what happens if you drop a file in a folder in the package explorer - the file is moved, the folder remains closed.

https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/95382/ is a commit where I did that for two commands. It shows nicely what is needed.

That's OK.

 > I am still not sure about showing a repository on drop.

Leave as is for now; we can revisit that later.

A quick question before I start on the plugin.xml. As further commands/menu items with respect to repository groups may be added and the declarative style for activation/visibility checking in the plugin.xml is hard to read (at least for me) and potentially repetitive, I was looking at the property testers.
Most of the current use cases have to do with the selection in the Repositories View. Should I extend 'GitSelection' (org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.selection.SelectionPropertyTester) or rather create a sibling for repository groups (RepoGroupSelection).

I'd prefer the second, because I would like to keep the existing code as unmodified as possible and this property tester would make sense for the RepositoryView only (no IResources). Further I would probably need quite a few new properties:
e.g. onlyReposSelected, onlyGroupsSelected, onlyReposInGroupsSelected (and maybe for later onlyVisibleGroupsSelected, onlyHidableGroupsSelected).

Stick to the expression language in XML where it fulfills the needs, even if it is verbose. No need to duplicate core functionality in custom property testers.

There is already the RepositoriesViewPropertyTester. Perhaps add new property tests, if needed, in there.

The first two should not be done via property testers; the Eclipse expression language is completely sufficient for those.
