DESCRIPTION:

Introduce repository groups to Repositories View

In order to allow the user to structure repositories a new node type
'group' is introduced. Groups can be created, renamed and deleted. If a
repository belongs to a group, it is not shown in the tree root.
Assignment is done by having repositories selected while creating the
group or by drag/drop.

I did indeed (intentionally) ignore the older comment on using File instead of String for the repository directories. I wanted to remain consistent with the existing API (usage of String in the ContentProvider).

I did the String->File refactoring and introduced lambdas where suggested. I'm not sure about the failing builds.
So far the reason was different every time and none of them seem to be related to the actual change.

I've done a pure functional test now, no code review. The last failing test is surely not related to your change.

* Suggest to change "Add Repository Group" to "Create Repository Group". Most dialogs in eclipse use create for something that does not exist yet, and add for something that already exists, but doesn't yet belong to another something.
* Please add "description" attributes in the plugin.xml for the newly added commands. (You can verify them either in the Ctrl-3 dialog or the keys preference page).
* "Remove from Repository Groups" should be "Remove from Repository Group" (singular). Yes, technically the user removes it from all groups, but the user is probably more thinking of the one group it is currently in (he has a different mental model than your implementation).
* I would shorten "Move to group 'X'" to "Move to 'X'". Otherwise there is "group" in every menu item of that menu, making it look somewhat verbose.
* The rename menu item is missing an ellipsis.
* The "delete repository groups" doesn't have a window title. On Windows this is visible, on other OS it may not be visible.
* Properties view fails on repo groups: NPE at org.eclipse.egit.ui.internal.repository.RepositoryPropertySourceProvider.getPropertySource(RepositoryPropertySourceProvider.java:100). You may need to check all callers of RepositoryTreeNode.getRepository(), since that now returns null for your new node type, while all callers could rely on nonnull before the change.

Besides those details, it looks quite good to me.
