DESCRIPTION:

[repo view] Introduce repository groups

In order to allow the user to structure repositories a new node type
'group' is introduced. A repository may belong to at most one group.
Groups can be created, renamed and deleted; they cannot be nested. If a
repository belongs to a group, it is not shown in the tree root.
Assignment is done by having repositories selected while creating the
group, by drag/drop or via a new context menu entry.

Rebased so that we get bug 552622 out of the way.

Also fixed copyright headers. We use "Copyright (C) FROM, TO Author", where FROM, TO are two years and give a range. (Yes, personally I would have written a range with a dash, but that's just the format EGit uses.) TO can be omitted for new files, of course. And it's not 100% consistent in the EGit sources. Generally I correct ones I see with more than two years.
