DESCRIPTION:

[releng] Try project deletion multiple times

We sometimes see test failures in the master build caused by not being
able to delete a test project. See builds 173, 170, 165... for examples.

Therefore repeat project deletion in case of error, as it may be locked
by some other concurrent processing.

The JavaProjectTester also runs project creation and deletion in workspace operations. Probably TestProject should also do so. I don't remember what the purpose of the TestUtil.waitForJobs() calls in JavaProjectTester was. Another difference is that the JavaProjectTester also makes sure that the project is shared with EGit.

When I wrote these Java tests in UI I hadn't realized that the core TestProject also created a Java project...

These gitflow tests create a git repo inside the project directory. Probably that contributes to the problems with deleting the projects. It also connects the project to the repo, but doesn't disconnect the project at the end. The GitMoveDeleteHook forbids deleting folders that are still connected.

If that is the problem I don't understand why these tests can work at all. We also should get a message somewhere that there was an active git repository in a folder. But in any case those test setups look fishy.

Line:429, org.eclipse.egit.core.junit/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/TestUtils.java -> In JavaProjectTester, we run that inside a workspace operation. Why only there? Shouldn't this be here?

Line:429, org.eclipse.egit.core.junit/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/TestUtils.java -> Done. Also converted to lambda and used ICoreRunnable, since WorkspaceRunnable documentation says to use that instead.
