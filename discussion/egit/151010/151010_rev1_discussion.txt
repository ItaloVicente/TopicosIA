DESCRIPTION:

[releng] Try project deletion multiple times

We sometimes see test failures in the master build caused by not being
able to delete a test project. See builds 173, 170, 165... for examples.

Therefore repeat project deletion in case of error, as it may be locked
by some other concurrent processing.

Appears that this didn't help yet. BTW, there's similar code in the JavaProjectTester.

Line:109, org.eclipse.egit.core.junit/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/test/TestProject.java -> Oh. This actually creates a Java project. So it really should use the JavaProjectTester.

Note that other places where we use Java projects we switch off autobuilding.

Does this project need to be a Java project? Which tests need that?

I've extracted that to a common place. Also the previous errors were in test setup, while this one was new (to me) in teardown, so it might already have shown an improvement.
