If we do this, then we have to pixel-peep to get a good-looking view. I noticed immediately that

* Below the commit buttons, we have slightly more (I'd guess 1 pixel) white space than below the staged viewer. That's already the case without your change, but it's much more noticeable now.
* The top margin appears to have become zero; the section headers are cheek to cheek with the form title's bottom separator line. A 1 or 2 pixel top margin might look better.

If we reduce exterior margins like this, we should also adapt interior margins, especially the vertical space between commit message viewer, author line, committer line, and the commit buttons. These spaces now look way too large.

(I only checked this on Mac, default theme, 4.6.3 runtime Eclipse.)

While I have applied the same change in many more places already, it doesn't work here, if you use light theme. Light theme has rounded borders for all the "headings", which suddenly connect to the upper toolbar etc.

When trying other kinds of optimizations around the space usage, my own conclusion has always been: We need to replace the form based UI by a standard SWT UI to use the space more efficiently. The form based elements have much more decoration, and therefore require more space (and we already pack them much tighter than in a manifest editor, if you compare).

If you want to compare for yourself, take these 3 views in order:
* history: no forms, everything rather compact
* reflog: forms top bar takes much more space than history top label, everything else looks compact (we could even remove the margin around the table)
* staging: everything form based, requires space where other views don't

That all being said, we should probably have a separate bug to discuss whether to replace the form UI in staging by something else. I can imagine there are other opinions about that.

Replacing the form based with a standard SWT UI would be very benefical. I think the correct bug for this discussion is https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=532458 Yesterday I removed for testing the form header and it would already save lots of space. But I also think that using a regular SWT UI would allow to save lot of space.
