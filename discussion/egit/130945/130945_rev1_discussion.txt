I have to verify the performance on a different machine, since the repository with the huge commit is not available on my personal development machine.

To be safe, please first read the current redraw flag state and in finally restore this state.

I don't think that's a good idea. The Javadoc says: "Nested calls to this method are stacked."

As long as it is ensured via try-finally that both calls are always executed, the state of drawing after both calls is exactly as it was before both calls (since it boils down to a counter, which is incremented and decremented by the implementation). Therefore if we do not call this exactly once with true and once with false, the nesting and the counter) run into the wild.

Or am I wrong with that?

if the drawing was disabled before, you enable it at the end, which is unexpected and leaves the code in inconsistent state. we had this bug in platform ui.

setRedraw(true) leads to counter++. setRedraw(false) leads to counter--. Therefore after my code has been run, the counter has exactly the same value as before my code. Therefore redrawing is either _still enabled_ (if counter <= 0) or _still disabled_ (if counter > 0). setRedraw(true) does _not_ enable redrawing, if it was disabled before.

Just think of this sequence of calls:
setRedraw(false) -> counter == 1
setRedraw(false) -> counter == 2
setRedraw(true) -> counter == 1
setRedraw(true) -> counter == 0.

Only the outer setRedraw(true) actually enables redrawing on the handle level.

@Andrey: AFAIK this is the way control.setRedraw() is to be used. As long as the false/true pairs are properly nested, this works. And if they're not properly nested here then Platform UI is doing something wrong.

@Michael: I see a huge speed-up with this, but the final setRedraw(true) still takes a few seconds on my Mac (and causes UI freeze warnings) with a test commit that adds 30000 empty files named file_<counter>.txt. I see no way around those final few seconds.

Tested with the original repository. Much improved. The UI is still blocked around 2 seconds, but Windows does not show ANR on the application title anymore.

OK, now I have IDE by hand, I see it. The bug I had in mind was slightly different, and not a problem here (see bug 537465).
