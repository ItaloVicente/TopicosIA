Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> I don't like this reflection business. Not OSGi-y, and it's unclear to me what happens on Java 9.

OSGi would be an extension point and an (optional) egit.lfs bundle that would register on that extension point. egit.lfs can then have a hard dependency on jgit.lfs, and can in its extension point implementation call BuiltinLFS.register() normally.

Maybe there should be also extension points for the preference UI, and for the start-up check. The platform's EFS implementation is a good place to look, it also provides extension points so that implementors of a new EFS can provide the EFS and some UI stuff for it. This should work in a similar way.

Line:133, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/BranchOperation.java -> Can be removed; consumed by the CheckoutCommand's monitor now.

Line:163, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/DiscardChangesOperation.java -> progress.newChild(1)

Line:169, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/DiscardChangesOperation.java -> Remove

Line:189, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/DiscardChangesOperation.java -> IProgressMonitor

Line:194, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/op/DiscardChangesOperation.java -> Just "progress" here (child now created at caller)

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> Please also see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/102790/. This will need to be reconciled somehow. And if we do this here for LFS, we risk downloading a potentially huge LFS blob and then doing a (slow) diff on it. I don't quite see where the
user could control this...

Line:40, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/ConfigurationChecker.java -> No longer true.

Line:116, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/ConfigurationChecker.java -> This API is still too new. Will work only on Eclipses >= Neon. Our baseline is still Luna. Please use the other constructor with String[].

Line:224, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitDocument.java -> You really want to do QuickDiff on LFS blobs?? And this thing will load it fully into memory, then create a string from it, so at least temporarily you'll need twice the memory. And then we'll see what Document does with it when we do the set(value) in line 99 above.

I just don't believe that's a good idea.

Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Well, theoretically, with the optional dependency we could also just do the call here (and catch any exception in case the bundle is not wired :)).

I agree that the extension point would be the cleanest method, although I fear that this is a quite large'ish change. Can a committer create that bundle for me (along with tycho build, etc.), so I can fill it with some logic?

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> It looks like your change will properly use smudge filters to retrieve file content now? In this case, we can just remove this change. Which one would deal better with large files? would it make a difference?

Line:224, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/decorators/GitDocument.java -> Hm. Now you say it :) What would be a alternative? Maybe only provide the real content if it is smaller than a certain size? just don't support quick diff on LFS blobs? (what's the best location to disable quick diff based on .gitattributes?)

Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> do you want an optional bundle or an optional bundle fragment like org.eclipse.egit.ui.smartimport ? if the latter which bundle would be the fragment's host bundle ?

Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> whatever I get :D I have no idea what would fit better into the existing architecture. Basically /all/ I want to do here is call BuiltinLFS.register() and have that be activated automatically when the bundle is present. Is it possible to have an Activator in a fragment?

Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> a fragment has no own lifecycle, it's extending the underlying host bundle, see e.g.

Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Hm, well, as I said. I just need to execute a single line of code once egit starts and the optional bundle is present. any ideas about how to achieve this are ok for me :)

I'd refrain from diff-ing large files stored in LFS by default to avoid poor performance. We could consider to provide a way to diff large files which aren't binary by providing another dedicated button to trigger that diff so that the user has control if he wants to run a potentially slow diff on a large file.

Often LFS storage is used to version large binary files which would first need support for custom diff drivers which we don't have yet in JGit/EGit. Diff-ing a binary file in a text based diff tool doesn't seem to be useful.
Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> yes, we should use the proper OSGi / Eclipse mechanisms in EGit

Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> if that's about registering builtin lfs filters the new fragment or bundle should probably extend org.eclipse.egit.core ?

Well if you manage to open a ZIP file in a text editor in eclipse which supports quick diff, would it be arguable that you get garbage? :D

But what about diff-able file formats, lets say somebody want's to add all XML files as LFS blobs...? This is more the case we should think about IMHO.
Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> probably, yes

I think most people will simply copy/paste .gitattributes entries as they don't want to bother thinking about it. Most of the entries you can find on the internet have "-text", so they will simply mark anything as binary :) but that is probably none of EGit's business...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:284, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> It would work with either. A fragment also has access to the host bundle's internals, and it uses the host's class loader. Don't know whether that would be needed. OTOH, a fragment should not provide new API, so if you're planning to do that, then use a separate bundle.

The activator here would have to check for registrations on that extension point and invoke registered handlers (and handle all kinds of exceptions -- EGit core must not crash when someone registers a buggy handler through that extension point). The new fragment/bundle would in its fragment.xml or plugin.xml register a handler for the extension point.

I know it may sound like overkill, but personally I think since EGit runs on an OSGi platform we should also use the proper OSGi mechanisms. But I'm open to be overruled on this one.
