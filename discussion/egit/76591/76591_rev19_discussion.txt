DESCRIPTION:

EGit integration for LFS

* Register builtin LFS on startup
  When EGit starts and the lfs bundle (org.eclipse.jgit.lfs) is
  available register the LFS implementation and check configuration.
* Diff/compare/index edit/blame support for LFS blobs.

I must say I'm quite unsure about the effects on the end-user experience of all this. LFS is intended for *large* blobs; I'm not sure at all that EGit could do a reasonable blame or quickdiff or comparison on, say, a 100Mb text file in reasonable time, without unduly blocking the UI, and without consuming all available memory. Or produce a FileDiff in the history view or in the CommitEditor. The latter already is slow and blocks the user if the commit has many changed files.

I also wonder about whether the diff attribute is the right choice. A diff attribute specifies a custom diff driver, but as far as I see here, quickdiff or the compare editor use their own diff mechanism; all we have to provide is the smudge-filtered content. That sounds more like normal smudge filtering as implemented in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/102790/ . So I'm not sure at all that sprinkling references to org.eclipse.jgit.util.LFS all over the place is the right way to go.

(In https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/102790/ I only did filtering for the compare editor and didn't think about LFS at all -- I suspect that change there would run into memory/execution time problems, too, if run on an LFS pointer that resulted in a 100Mb text comparison, where one side might need to be downloaded first...)

But maybe I'm just seeing problems that don't exist -- I'm not an LFS expert at all. Had no need so far to ever use it; all my knowledge about it comes from reading descriptions of the general mechanism. Just had to vent my concerns.

Well. The LFS changes over in EGit do add a kind of custom LFS diff driver that downloads the blob, if needed, and then does the normal raw-text diff on it.

Yes, somewhere in all this there should be a check that the binary attribute isn't set for the item being handled.

Or yaml... from what I thought I had understood about LFS one would define not only smudge/clean filters for lfs but also set the text/binary attributes appropriately?
