Line:92, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> The Eclipse built-in compare support just takes the contents as input. So I think the correct way is indeed to apply the smudge filter, not the diff driver/config.

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> As I said on an earlier patch set, I'm not sure whether special-casing this for LFS is the right way to go.

As mentioned over in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/102790/ I do believe the user will need a way to control whether this will happen on a per-file basis; for instance with a .gitattribute.

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> I agree. Your more general approach seems like a better idea anyway - not so LFS specific :)

I will remove this change, but we need yours then instead.

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> Not so fast. I said I was unsure here. This needs a real design decision. Maybe a TODO is sufficient. Then you could go on with this, and we could finalize my change later. I'm a bit nervous about putting so many brand-new things into EGit now, when 4.11 is about to come out. (Or so I understood...) Personally I prefer to merge such things shortly _after_ a release was branched. Gives a longer beta-test period by EGit nightly users.

If we do this special case for LFS now, is it then still possible to switch later to the more general "use smudge filter"? And maybe we'd then want to add something on top of that to also consider diff.*.textconv and use that, if set, and the smudge filter only otherwise. Change https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/102790/ would also need some design decisions...

Line:99, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/storage/GitBlobStorage.java -> Of course, switching later on is always possible, and should be as straight forward as discarding this change when  rebasing/merging your changes... I'll resurrect the change so we could add a functioning LFS support to the release.
