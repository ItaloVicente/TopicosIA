ok, this looks better

I found a use case where "select all" / "deselect all" would be more useful than "toggle selection":

Suppose I have 17 repos in the list and 8 are already checked, now I want to just search one repo which is not yet selected, toggle selection is not useful here as it would select the 9 repos which weren't selected previously, so I need to click a lot of check boxes to reach what I want.
In this case the cheapest path would require 9 clicks (deselect 8 and select one).

Using "deselect all" button I could reach what I want with just 2 clicks.

Hence I would vote for replacing the "toggle selection" by "select all" / "deselect all" buttons, this pattern is also used in import projects wizard.

Matthias, would you be okay with switching to icon buttons for select all, deselect all? They would take up less space and could be aligned on the right of the table.

The icons would be similar to the collapse all/expand all icons except with check/uncheck icons.
