Interesting. We have no Jenkins build for releases older than stable-5.0?

So far I was too lazy to maintain jobs for older egit releases.
I fixed this in stable-4.9 since otherwise this branch can't be built anymore since Orbit only retains R-releases forever and purges old S-releases after a couple of months. I should have done this earlier.

In jgit we also maintain older releases to help Gerrit and other upstream applications to maintain its releases which are still in maintenance. The Gerrit project prefers to not upgrade to a new minor/major jgit version in their maintenance releases.

OK. If you feel confident it'll build... I start to see now why some people work with different workspaces for different branches; switching to an old branch, resetting API baselines, and re-loading target platforms is so time consuming. I didn't try this, but the change looks good to me.
