DESCRIPTION:

[releng] Switch to BREE Java 11

Update the BREE in all MANIFEST.MF and .classpaths to JavaSE-11. Update
root pom.xml to use --release 11, and to compile against the egit-4.17
target by default. Update the JDT compiler settings.

Update tycho to 2.4.0 and the JBoss tycho tools to 2.2.0. Require maven
3.6.3. (3.8.2 is not installed on CI yet?) Remove pack200.

Bump spotbugs to 4.4.1; the previously used 3.1.2 uses a groovy version
that performs illegal reflective accesses that are forbidden in later
Java versions.

While we're at it, also bump the CBI jarsigner to 1.3.2.

egit-4.17 corresponds to Eclipse 2020-09, which is the first Eclipse
version that required Java 11, and which is EGit's new baseline as of
EGit 6.0.

In the Oomph setup, use egit-4.18 as default. Eclipse 2020-09 had a
critical bug on OS X that shows up in a child Eclipse even on OS X
10.14.6 and that breaks table rendering with custom painting (bug
565969), which breaks the rendering of the EGit history view.

Hence developers are encouraged to use a target platform newer than
egit-4.17. The CI build will still compile against that platform to
ensure that EGit works on its baseline version.

Adapt tests so that they work with either target platform. Eclipse
platform changed the message in a TitleAreaDialog from Text to Label
in 4.18 (bug 564535) and changed it back to Text in 4.21 (bug 574071).
This makes SWTBot tests for this message dependent on the JFace version,
and causes particular trouble in WizardDialogs.

Make TestUtil.processUIEvents() a no-op: running event loops in tests
may block the tests if there is an asyncExec queued that opens a modal
dialog. Adapt tests not to rely on UI event processing.

Fix one bug in GenerateHistoryJob which sometimes didn't update the
history view if there were no commits found at all.

Add a null check in SpellCheckableMessageArea to work around an NPE
occurring on gtk, where apparently forceFocus() may get called on a
disposed widget.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> split these updates into a separate changes ?

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> separate change before this one ?

Line:41, /COMMIT_MSG -> is this directly related to the switch to BREE Java 11 ?

Line:45, /COMMIT_MSG -> separate change ?

Line:267, pom.xml -> Why is this commented out ?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'd have to try again with tycho 1.7.0/jboss 1.5.1 and Java 11. IIRC I had a problem initially with that combination, but it might have been something fixed by the other changes. I tried a lot until I had a first working build; this turned out way more complicated than expected.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done.

Line:41, /COMMIT_MSG -> The Java 8 builds work as is. The problem became apparent only after the switch to Java 11. I'd prefer not to spend another couple of days fighting to get a Java 8 build working with processUIEvents a no-op. Our tests are super fragile.

Line:45, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could try, however, the problem was never hit in the Java 8 build, but always occurs in the Java 11 maven build. So I think fixing it in this change is right.

Line:267, pom.xml -> It's commented out because I wasn't sure yet if this might be needed still in some refactored form, or not.

See the bug. With all environments defined here, Tycho (1.7.0 or 2.4.0) somehow includes all SWT versions. With Java 11, this leads to split packages, and one cannot compile UI code anymore: "The type org.eclipse.swt.widgets.Shell cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files."

The downside is that we now get warnings about the build being platform-dependent.

I don't know what the correct way would be to define environments.

I could remove it altogether; leaving it in comments could serve as a reminder that there is something still not quite right in the Java 11 build.

Line:267, pom.xml -> Fixed in PS 10. Don't know why it didn't work initially, perhaps because of the 32bit architectures? Anyway, removed those and uncommented, and now it works.
