context menu for submodules, but executing it had no effect. A guard is
added preventing the handler from being active.

Line:2453, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Good catch. I suspect the deletion (just below) should be guarded, too. From looking at the code it seems to me that it might actually delete things, but the user may end up with a completely inconsistent repo. For one, .gitmodules and .git/config of the parent repo are not updated.

If enabled, it should probably perform the equivalent of a git rm on the sub-module. Which, IIRC correctly, isn't implemented in JGit yet.

So it's probably best to also forbid that. (Didn't try it, though. Had no setup in which I could risk corrupting the repo.)
