What is an "agnostic" symbolic link?

Thanks for this series, but

1. separate working trees need support in JGit first; see bug 477475.
2. this series needs tests, tests, and then some tests. :-)

My -2 votes on these changes don't mean I find them bad per se. Didn't look in detail; noticed one potential deadlock problem, though. The -2 means more "must not be merged before JGit properly supports separate working trees". Once that's the case, these UI changes could be picked up again.
