DESCRIPTION:

[historyView] Abbreviate commit-id in commit list

To gain some screen real estate abbreviate the commit-id in the commit
list. We abbreviate to fixed length of 8 digits in the list to not
waste CPU cycles on doing a more precise abbreviation. The full
commit-id is available in the commit detail pane and can also be
copied to the clipboard.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

The abbreviate() call does not append "...". I believe we should have them to make it clear that we have some abbreviation here.
