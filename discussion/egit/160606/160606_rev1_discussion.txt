DESCRIPTION:

Allow skipping clone destination page

The git clone wizard can be finished once the destination page has valid
values. With the old implementation those valid values are automatically
pre-filled when the destination page is set visible the first time. With
this change the clone destination values are pre-filled when the source
branch page becomes complete.

That way the user does not need to navigate to the (magically
pre-filled) destination page, but can instead finish from the branch
selection page.

Cool. Is it feasible to extend this change to bug 502558 skip the BranchSelectionPage as well? The cloning seems to support an "all-Branches" flag which could be set if the branch selection page was skipped. Currently this fails due to the first call of SourceBranchPage#checkPage setting the page to incomplete. Only if you go to the SourceBranchPage and back, the button is enabled.

I've explicitly not linked that bug in the change, since I'm not sure how much of an effort skipping that page is, and I didn't want to get more pressure feedback only.

If that option is available, then that sounds much more doable. Nevertheless I would like to merge this separately, and eventually tackle the next page afterwards.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

This change does not handle the following user steps correctly

* open wizard with URL-1 (finish deactivated - OK)
* go to next page (branch selection)
* deselect one of many branches
* go back to Source Git Repository (finish activated - OK)
* enter repo URL-2 (finish still activated - not OK!?)
* press finish

There is an exception because the selected branches are from URL-1 but the cloning is done on URL-2. Even if you don't deactivate a branch and by default all branches are cloned, the clone destination directory and hence the repository name is wrong; the result of cloning not consistent.

One workaroud would be to ensure the cloneDestination-page to be incomplete on going back. However, my feeling is that it would be a better idea to have *all* the cloning relevant information kept in one object which would be shared among all pages and each page just modifies the parts it is responsible for. That way, all consistency checks and updates can be done in one place and the pages need not "update" each other. GitRepositoryInfo seems to be the obvious candidate.
When changing the repository-URL, branch selection and destination can be reset to default, default destination directory can be updated and checked for non-existence etc.

(I am not claiming that this refactoring is in the scope of this proposed change.)
