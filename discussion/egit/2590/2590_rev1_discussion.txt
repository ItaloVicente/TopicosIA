DESCRIPTION:

Do not allow to delete working dir but not to remove projects

The Delete Repository command first prompted the user to delete the
working dir and then to remove projects from the eclipse workspace. If
the working dir was deleted but projects not removed there were
several exception from egit. Now deleting the working dir does always
lead to removing the projects.

Addionally the two dialogs are collapsed into one.
