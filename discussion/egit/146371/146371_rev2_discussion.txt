Thanks for the hint. Andrey pointed me into a very similar direction, just instead of a list, he suggested creating one preference for every repository. I tried that out first. See new patch set. Please give me feedback on that.

Good idea. Is there an estimation on when Matthias' change will be merged? Then I could just use the very same listener.
