DESCRIPTION:

Add show first parent only button to history view

Add an action to the GitHistoryPage to show first parent only with some
extra code to allow the setting to be sticky to one repository.
Also add getter and setter for GitHistoryPage.currentRepo, so a repo
change can be detected.
Add the action to the toolbar and menu.
Add the corresponding preference to the preference page.
Also add a new icon for the action.
Finally implement, that the corresponding preference sets first parent
on the RevWalk.

Hmm, I've tried now all 4 combinations of those two buttons, and depending on the code / history they all can show different results and so potentially be useful for some cases.

3 items instead of 2 toolbar actions? Do you mean 2 or 4 (either/or state or all combinations)? Or what are "3" items?

Regarding the proposal to combine them - not sure how one could meaningfully name the states and which icons could be appropriate. That could be confusing. 

May be we just don't need to put the new button on the toolbar but keep it in the view menu? 

I think this could be less confusing to see similar looking buttons next ro each other (menu shows action names, so it is easier to understand the difference).

I meant the 4 combinations minus the one I had imagined to be not useful. However, since you said all are good, the suggestion of a dropdown is not so reasonable anymore.

I like that suggestion.
