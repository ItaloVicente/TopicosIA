First: GREAT. I finally see my branch history!!!

I've tried this on our monster repo and the new mode must be default *for our* IDE.

Because of this: please add the same option in the Team -> Git -> History view preference page. This way I can set it in Oomph / make a product default for us.

Last point (before looking on the code): the "x" on the icon must be not that saturated, it is too dark. Also I think it can be moved few pixels to the right so that the left part of the merge arrow is fully shown.

And there needs to be a HiDPI version of the icon.

May I suggest to use the blue branch icon as base? I think it might look better.

The setting should be persisted per repository; that would make it even more useful.

Can you point me into a direction on how to do that?

I would have to try to be sure, but here's an idea: store a list of git directories in the preference. The preference is changed only by that button, so you can read the list once and keep it in memory. Then set first-parent only for repositories whose git dir is in that list.

When a repository is removed, you'd probably also want to remove the git dir from that preference. There's a change by Matthias already to clear the history when a repo is deleted, see https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/146471/ . That preference listener could be used to remove the git dir from the "first-parent" preference.

Probably would want a global default setting, too. User preference, settable on the preference page. "Use --first-parent by default". In your product, you could set that global pref to true so that it is enabled out of the box without having to know where the user's local clone is.

Other users can leave that global pref false; --first-parent will then be used only if they click that button while the history of a repository is shown.

Note that this preference would have to store relative paths for git repos inside the workspace, and absolute paths for git repos outside the workspace, like RepositoryUtil.PREFS_DIRECTORIES_REL. Resolve on reading the preference.
