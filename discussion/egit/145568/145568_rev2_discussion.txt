DESCRIPTION:

Fix showing selected refs or commits in history view

When the history view shows only the current branch ("Show all
branches and tags" _off_), selecting some other branch in the git
repositories view might not show the selected branch. It would be
shown only if that branch happened to be merged into the currently
checked out branch. The same could be observed when using "Show In
History" on a commit in the results of a "Git Search": the commit
would only be selected if it was contained in the branch currently
checked out.

Change this by always considering such a selected branch or commit
as an additional start point for the RevWalk. This enables the user
to make the history view show exactly two branches (plus all those
merged into these two), and also correctly selects commits not on
the current branch.

Tested. Seems to be working nicely.

I noticed that we have yet another bug with the show in history: If the currently selected branch is already the input, then nothing is done (which is generally right). but if the branch has been scrolled out of view, we simply return without scrolling to the top of that branch. Nevertheless, that seems completely independent of both your history changes, so I may create a separate new bug, if you want.
Line:2319, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Independent of your change: Is this considered a best practice? Having the tracing around guard conditions? I typically put guard conditions before everything else for clarity. However, I also don't use tracing at all myself, so I'm not sure if "immediate returns" are normally traced or not.

Line:2348, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> this seems superflous, doesn't it? by contract, equals() must be able to deal with null, so that is already contained in the following call. I also find lines with an assignment and a directly following equals operator very hard to read (on first glance it looked like 2 nested assignments in C).

Line:2319, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Same here; I very rarely use it. I think the immediate return could well be done outside the try-finally.

Line:2348, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> Right; will change. It's a left-over from a previous version where I dealt only with Refs, and had a selectedRef here and compared the object ids pointed to by the refs.
