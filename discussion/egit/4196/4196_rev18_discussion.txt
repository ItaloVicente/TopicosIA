DESCRIPTION:

Allow to move changes in compare editor

All compare editors that compares working tree version against version
in index can now move particular hunk from left to right and other way
around. All changes are persisted to file system/git index after saving
compare results.

To add this functionality we need to wrap team's specific OpenInCompare
action into our own (GitOpenInCompare) action, because team framework
forces right hand side to be always read only. We want this writable
instead since we want to move changes from working copy to git index.

Also removes EditableSharedDocumentAdapter and LocalResourceTypedElement
copied from Team Framework because of "instanceof" checks during compare
editor create and save actions.
