DESCRIPTION:

Allow to move changes in compare editor

All compare editors that compares working version against version in
index can now move particular hunk from left to right and other way
around. All changes are persisted to file system/git index after saving
compare results.

To add this functionality we need to wrap team's specific OpenInCompare
action into our own (GitOpenInCompare) action, because team framework
forces right hand side to be always read only. We want this writable
instead since we want to move changes from working copy to git index.

Patch Set 15: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

When opening compare editor on a dirty / not yet staged non-workspace file from staging view in the pane for unstaged changes I can't save changes done in the left pane of the compare editor (corresponding to working tree state of the file). When clicking save or Ctrl-S the change I did in the left pane disappears. When copying a hunk from the right pane to the left using the left arrow button the copying works but the result cannot be saved. For workspace files this works properly.
