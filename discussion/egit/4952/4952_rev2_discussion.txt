I propose the following:

1. Let's accept this change as is (restores the old decoration behavior)

2. Start a discussion on the mailing list about the described decoration changes

I'm not sure on this:

1. I would prefer if I do not get a dirty marker on project level if there is an empty folder inside the project. I think only important information should bubble upwards.

2. This fix brings back the features of the old decorator implementation.
Decorating untracked files with > would be a change that needs discussion on the mailing list.

The patch improves things but there are two missing pieces:
- Files should also get the '>' decoration to be consistent 
  with modified files. This would also be consistent to the
  CVS team provider.
- I know folders aren't directly tracked by Git but since
  an empty folder has the '?' decoration it should it 
  should also propagate the '>' upwards and have the '>'.

re 1: '>' stands for "dirty" and for me, as soon as there is any diff compared to what's in the repository, such a project is dirty. Otherwise you have to rename the label for '>' to "interesting changes". Also, the fact that EGit shows a '?' indicates that it is not completely unimportant.

re 2: I see that the information is redundant but keep in mind that for disabled people, the icon is not "readable", hence '>' is an important information for them.

The current patch already helps a lot, hence I think it's best to proceed as you suggest.
