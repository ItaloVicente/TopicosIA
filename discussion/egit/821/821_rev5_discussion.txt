DESCRIPTION:

Delete invalid projects after work dir checkout

Operations performing a work dir checkout (e.g. branch, reset) may delete
.project files. This leads to inconsistent projects causing follow-up
problems (checkout conflicts). Details of the problem can be found in the
related bug.

This fix deletes projects that got inconsistent by the work dir checkout.
In future there could also be a handling for projects added by a work dir
checkout (e.g. asking the user to open these projects). A test case for
BranchOperation was added.

Also TagOperation doesn't need to refresh projects since it doesn't modify
any resources hence this call to refreshProjects was removed.
