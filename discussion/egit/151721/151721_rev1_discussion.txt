DESCRIPTION:

Comparisons of submodules: fix and make non-editable

Invoking "Compare with index" in the staging view on a submodule
didn't work. It showed an empty editable index part, and when edited
and saved would stage a file.

Show the correct content: the object ID from the index is the HEAD
of the submodule and is also the content. There is no blob with this
ID.

Forbid editing such index entries as it's much too fragile and can
lead to corrupt data far too easily.

In LocalNonWorkspaceTypedElement also fix finding the submodule
repository; in some cases the former code could not find it and
then tried to open an InputStream on the directory.

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> In particular I have an old test repository with a submodule present in .git/modules, present in .git/config, its working tree present at the right place in the parent repo's working tree, but not registered in .gitmodules, and not committed either.

Don't remember how that state was created. In any case the new code does find the sub-repo and shows its head, and (because the sub-repo isn't in the index) an empty non-editable editor for the index side.

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> I remember now how that state came about to be. I had cloned (recursively) an upstream repo with the submodule, then checked out an older branch before that submodule was added.

.gitmodules is checked in, so the entry there for that new submodule got removed by the checkout. But the working tree remained (and is shown as untracked submodule in the staging view), and so did everything under .git. Repo view does not show this "untracked submodule". Canonical git shows it as an untracked directory.
