DESCRIPTION:

Branch Selection Dialog: mark checked out branch

On the BranchSelectionDialog, the checked out branch or
tag should be marked and made visible. Currently this is
only working if the curerntly checked out branch is a local
branch. The fix makes this work also for remote branches
and tags.
