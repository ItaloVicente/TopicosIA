DESCRIPTION:

Auto-sharing must not connect root or home directories

When there are multiple mappings found for a project, EGit used
to add the last one (the topmost one) found to the configured
repositories. This is to avoid adding submodules as configured
repositories.

But just taking the topmost repository found is not good; it could
lead to adding ~/.git (if that exists) to the configured repositories.
A repo at ~/.git is likely to have to have a huge working tree with
millions of files, and it's almost always a user error (for instance,
typing "git init" by mistake in the home directory and then forgetting
about it).

Instead walk up the list of nested repositories found. If an already
configured repository is found, stop. Otherwise, add the topmost one
that has still a "valid" path, i.e., that is neither at ~ or above nor
at root.

Looks okay functionality wise, I only suggest a small refactoring.
Line:730, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> can be removed now

Line:748, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> The "already configured" logic is spread over 2 places (the other is line 756). We could make it easier to understand by doing something like

 newPathStrings = mappings.map(m -> m.getGitDirAbsolutePath().toString().collect(...))
 if (!Collections.disjoint(configured, newPathStrings)) {
   return;
 }

Line:730, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Not here, but inside isValidRepositoryPath. If I remove it here I get a potential null access warning. (I think it was at line 735.)

Line:748, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Since we have to walk up the chain of nested repositories anyway, I don't see how that would simplify anything.

Line:730, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> Okay, get it. In such cases I'm in favor of not removing the "duplicate" guard inside the method. Otherwise the method might become a source of failure in the future.

Line:748, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> It's not about simplifying the problem that needs to be solved or about optimizing runtime. It's just more easy to understand for someone who has not written the code. During review I had to understand
a) you check the first mapping via the gitDirPath variable in 746. The comment there explains that, but it does not explain how the other mappings are checked.
b) you iterate over the mappings, but not the first mapping (750)
c) you check other mappings, which are not the first, via 756 (under a different variable name than gitDirPath from a).
d) all the other flow control in 754 and 759 does not disturb the check of the mappings

This kind of reverse engineering could be avoided by handling the "have we seen any of the mappings already" aspect in one place, instead of mixing it with the "find the best mapping in a loop" aspect. Thinking about it again, I would probably even extract my suggested code into a method and write this in line 744 to make it even more clear:

 if (isRepositoryAlreadyConfigured(mappings)) {
   return
 }

 boolean isRepositoryAlreadyConfigured(mappings)) {
   configured = ...
   mappingStrings = ...
   return !Collections.disjoint(configured, mappingStrings);
 }

That would also make it possible to extract all the remaining code afterwards into another method 

 findBestMapping(mappings) {
   ...
 }
