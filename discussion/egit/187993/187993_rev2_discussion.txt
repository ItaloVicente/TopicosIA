Line:109, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitHelper.java -> Reading the template here has the effect that it is read pretty early and we read it over and over again even if it didn't change since last time we read it. E.g. staging/unstaging a file reads the template content again. 

Try to avoid unnecessary reads by reading the template content as late as possible and avoid re-reading the content if the file didn't change since it was read last time. This can be achieved using FileSnapshot which caches a file's file attributes. Use FileSnapshot#save to capture a file's attributes and use #isModified to check if it changed. This does a stat call instead of reading the content which is a lot faster if we read the content already.

Also: how does this interact with the ICommitMessageProvider/ICommitMessageProvider2 extension point mechanism? Which one takes precedence, and which one _should_ take precedence?

Line:109, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commit/CommitHelper.java -> at least the template content shouldn't be read if the current commit message is not null or empty

Agree, I refactored to load the template only on demand. However, the FileSnapshot would be rather fitting to jgit than here.

> at least the template content shouldn't be read if the current commit message is not null or empty

This is now controlled by the callers StagingView and CommitIU.
