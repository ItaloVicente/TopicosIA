DESCRIPTION:

Fix some UI Tests

Some UI tests were broken because their sequence has changed and thus some
user preferences that were changed no longer have their default values as
expected by some other tests.

Furthermore, the "delay" being set by a static method in one of the test
base classes got lost due to this change (whether this parameter is effective
depends on the sequence of class loading, so it is not reliable), and the
delay was removed altogether and some Thread.sleep() calls or local refresh
calls were added where needed. This resulted in much faster execution.

In order to allow delayed replay, a specific launch config was checked in.
Finally, one test was broken to to productive code changes.
