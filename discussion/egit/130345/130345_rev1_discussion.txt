DESCRIPTION:

Fixed: Gitflow does not honor config gitflow.feature.start.fetch=true

Using this option will cause Gitflow to fetch from the upstream
repository before creating a new feature branch. The main benefit of
this is that the check for diverging develop and origin/develop will
always protect the user from creating a feature branch from an outdated
develop state.

Also removed obsolete exception from method signature.

Bug 539755

I don't really know that feature, so this is more of a style review only.
Line:322, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/GitFlowConfig.java -> remove

Line:347, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/GitFlowConfig.java -> why not config.getBoolean(...) directly?

Line:68, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/op/FeatureStartOperation.java -> you should unify the progress monitor directly after the if branch. See https://help.eclipse.org/kepler/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fapi%2Forg%2Feclipse%2Fcore%2Fruntime%2FSubMonitor.html, section "Example Branches", which uses progress.setWorkRemaining() to make the remaining progress behave the same, independent of whether the if branch was taken.

Line:50, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/actions/FeatureStartHandler.java -> This reads the wrong preferences. This is stored in the EGit UI preferences, but you're using the gitflow UI Activator here.

Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/op/FeatureStartOperation.java -> Document the time unit and allowed range. Seconds? Milliseconds? What if < 0? What if == 0?

Line:75, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/op/FeatureStartOperation.java -> progress.newChild(1)

Line:275, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/op/GitFlowOperation.java -> Removal of URISyntaxException breaks contract compatibility. See [1].

Don't try to do this in this change.

Line:275, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/op/GitFlowOperation.java -> Is this really a problem in practice? In the case of egit/jgit all the bundles get the same new version number with each release. So if gitflow 5.2 requires egit 5.2, a normal installation should be fine. Only if someone explicitly uses gitflow 5.1 with egit.core 5.2 (or vice versa), a problem appears, right? Or am I missing something entirely?

Line:275, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/op/GitFlowOperation.java -> This has nothing to do with mixing EGit and Egit-Gitflow versions. You can't, anyway, since we have tight version constraints among our bundles. This is about downstream users of this public API. Downstream users will have to change their code (remove their catching or propagation of the exception).

The change is still binary compatible, though. I don't know if it would be OK to do this if only the minor version increases.

Thank you guys for the prompt and thorough review!
Line:50, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/ui/internal/actions/FeatureStartHandler.java -> Good point. I have made that mistake in the past, and now just copied it. Hence, I'm creating a separate commit, rebasing this one. See I990e8b6482c3cc5fd157724e355e4f4c03e7a217

Line:322, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/GitFlowConfig.java -> Done

Line:347, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/GitFlowConfig.java -> Good point.
Done.

Line:39, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/op/FeatureStartOperation.java -> I copied the JavaDoc from org.eclipse.jgit.transport.Transport.setTimeout(int). Additional details regarding special values could be found in the implementation for com.jcraft.jsch.Request.request(Session, Channel).

I see that as a user of this API, I would want to find this information directly in the JavaDoc here. However, what promises can I make, if this value is passed through several layers, many of which do not make promises regarding the semantics either?
I feel like making no promise here is safer than one that may be misleading because any lower level might change its implementation.
I could add this information, though, if I can back it up with JUnits. Though, if we want to do it like this, I think we should start with EGit core API, which is arguably more important.

Line:68, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/op/FeatureStartOperation.java -> Thanks for the link! Haven't worked with the progress API in a while.
Done.

Line:75, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/op/FeatureStartOperation.java -> Done

Line:275, org.eclipse.egit.gitflow/src/org/eclipse/egit/gitflow/op/GitFlowOperation.java -> Thanks for the link. Good to have as a checklist.
I moved this change to a separate commit. See I54f309075f0243dbb41c8320e1089606bba5c942
As it is a source compatibility issue, I assume it can be merged once we bump versions to 5.3. Correct?
Done.
