DESCRIPTION:

Show messages in CommitDialog for errors that prevent committing.

Previously validation was done when the Commit button was selected
and dialogs were opened explaining why committing was not possible.

Now these messages are displayed in the title area of the commit
dialog and the Commit button is disabled when the commit cannot
be completed.
