The chance of Team doing anything for 3.7 is low... for now... and if they did anything... it was force us to depend on 3.7 as a minimum requirement (which we don't want to do at the moment). So for 0.9, I think this is the right approach for now.

An alternate approach would be to try to get these API's to be public and possible continue to use the internal API's until 0.9.

Patch Set 1: Unclean IP, do not check in

Bad copyright is un-clean IP, I think (see Remy's comments)

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Copy-n-pasting? I don't like this idea. Should we wait for response from platform team [1]?
