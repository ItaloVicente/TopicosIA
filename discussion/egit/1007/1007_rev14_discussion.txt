DESCRIPTION:

Git Repositories View UI Tests III: remote configuration handling

Remote configuration handling in the Git Repositories view must
behave like the standard: it is possible to push to a remote repository
if only a "url" is present in the config, but no "pushurl". If both
url and pushurl or pushurls exist, they are all used.
Accordingly, the "configure push" UI must show the (fetch-) URL
if it is present and make addition of "pushurl"s optional in this case.
Also the Repo View content provider had to be adjusted in order to
show the "push" node if only a "url" and a "push" but no "pushurl"
is defined.

Please rebase once again. The current state does not work with current JGit. There was an API change in JGit. EGit was adapted to that change in commit f01b3b007c43adc1ac7c9b3c876453a868f85bbe.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think this title is misleading. The change is not only about tests.
