DESCRIPTION:

Implement "Compare with Revision" feature in history view.

When a user double-clicks on an entry in the CommitGraphTable
the selected file is compared with the working tree.

Stefan added handling for the case that the file is not contained 
in the commit.

Patch Set 4: No score; No score

- I tried with Eclipse 3.6 M5 on Ubuntu 9.10, this is working for me.
- When selecting an older version in the CommitGraphTable and then double clicking the entry in the path pane (bottom right pane in the resource history view) this modifies the working copy of the double clicked file. I recognized this since I had the working copy open in an editor and bringing up the compare view turned the editor to the dirty state. I don't know if this is caused by this patch but I think this should be fixed since comparing versions should not have side effects on the working copy.

Patch Set 4:

Hi Robin,

I have to admit that I have not yet tested the code on linux (it is a flaw that we do not yet have linux and Mac OS instances in our department).

However, the code is basically the same as in CommitFileDiffViewer (l.62). 

The double click only has effect when the input of the history page is file. Could you please check once again if in your case the history is shown for a file and not for a folder or the project?

Thanks,
Stefan
