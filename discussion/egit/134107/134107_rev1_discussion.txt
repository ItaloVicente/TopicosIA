DESCRIPTION:

Prevent NPE in CompareTreeView

The stack trace from the AERI report indicates that one of the
children returned from the PathNodeCOntentProvider is null. Be
more careful in populating this array of children: avoid adding
null elements.

Line:952, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CompareTreeView.java -> I just thought that your (complete) code change looks like a perfect candidate for Java streams, since it is effectively a huge mapping and filtering. However, when I tried to write that code, I failed at the selected part. If I start with Stream.of(resources)..., then this instanceof-check seems impossible, since it would require an object from much earlier of my .filter.map.filter.map chain. Any ideas about that?

Nevertheless we can just merge your change, if you don't want to explore that territory. :)

Line:952, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/dialogs/CompareTreeView.java -> I didn't analyze _why_ we get a null entry in that "nodes" array. Maybe we should do so. Off-hand, I don't see why there are two different maps for files and containers. Is that for file-folder conflicts? Otherwise how could there ever be a file and a folder with the same path? If we really can't have that, a single map would be sufficient, and then this distinction wouldn't be necessary, and a streams-based implementation would be straight-forward.

But while streams are sometimes nice I don't see any pressing need to rewrite this using streams. The code is clear enough as it is, and I don't think a stream would be more efficient.
