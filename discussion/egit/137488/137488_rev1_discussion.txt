DESCRIPTION:

Use https for all eclipse links

* Updated all eclipse links to use https.
* Regenerated .target to reflect changes in .tpd files.

I'm aware that some of the user documentation changes may be overwritten
when we regenerate documentation from the wiki.

There we 2 references to gerrit URLs in test code which were not
resolvable with http or https in the browser.

Line:32, org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/JGit/New_and_Noteworthy/5.1/Updating-This-Document.html -> These Updating-This-Document.html files are generated during the build in the build-help.xml Ant task. The URL must be fixed there; I presume the edit you did there would also fix this URL.

And why do we have the 5.1 N&N here? Last release was 5.2, and I'd expect this to contain the 5.3 N&N when we do the 5.3 release.

BTW, looks like your script missed the corresponding files in the EGit subfolder.

Line:32, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/wizards/clone/TestRepositoryServerProvider.java -> Looks like this doesn't exist at all?? Seems to be a very old link.

Line:32, org.eclipse.egit.doc/help/JGit/New_and_Noteworthy/5.1/Updating-This-Document.html -> No script involved. I'm unclear about the documentation. I thought that the files in the egit subfolder are created from the wiki, so I thought we either need to fix some links there or we just need to adapt the baseUrl property in the transformation script. I did neither, and wanted to clarify that first.

To my believe this change should be complete, except for egit documentation. And I would like to do that one independently, when I know better how to do that transformation.

Line:32, org.eclipse.egit.ui.test/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/wizards/clone/TestRepositoryServerProvider.java -> That's the one I mentioned in the commit message. All other links seem reasonable, this is not browsable with http or https.
