Patch Set 11: Looks good to me, approved; IP review completed

Having two buttons "link with editor" "link with selection" in Git Repositories View with the same icon looks weird. Maybe this could be combined in one toggle "link with selection" ?

Test coverage should be improved. Also there are quite some TODOs left. I propose to do these in subsequent changes to lower the overall review effort which comes with such large changes.
