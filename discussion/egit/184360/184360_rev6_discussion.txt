DESCRIPTION:

Give "add remote" capability directly to RemoteSelectionCombo

So consumers don't have to repeat addition of a specific button, and as
the item to get new remote is part of the combo, it usually saves some
space on screen.

If an error occurs when closing the add remote dialog the erroneous remote is added anyway.
This doesn't happen without this change. The remote is only added if no error occurs.

Found this by chance since I had a URL of an egit change in the clipboard when adding a remote
from the push branch dialog to another repository. I only entered a name for the new remote and clicked finish. An error dialog came up. After closing it I noticed that the remote was created.

I believe the "Add remote" dialog should take care of validating the remote, but as a hint and without blocking addition, since it's possible for a user to add a remote that's not accessible (yet) because they're not fully online for instance.
