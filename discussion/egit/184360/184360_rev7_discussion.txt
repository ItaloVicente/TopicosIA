DESCRIPTION:

Give "add remote" capability directly to RemoteSelectionCombo

So consumers don't have to repeat addition of a specific button, and as
the item to get new remote is part of the combo, it usually saves some
space on screen.

The behavior we're seeing with "wrong remotes" is the behavior that would happen if first creating a remote in the deciated wizard, and then selecting the remote in the push wizard.
This issue is not really about the combo IMO, it's more that checking the remote should happen during the remote creation wizard, so it seems more like a topic for a separate change.

sure, this can be done in a separate change.
 
But then we shouldn't submit this change without this other change since otherwise the behavior of the wizard would degrade from a user's perspective.

I disagree that the behavior would actually degrade, it's an improvement to me: I actually faced the current behavior of the wizard and perceived it as a bug that the remote I just created is not stored until I push (I basically wasted time configuring a remote that vanished, moreover, it's usually when trying to configure Gerrit with HTTPs and generated password because SSH is blocked on the network I'm using and I didn't realize there is a gateway connection page I need to deal with before expecting my remote to be available).
