DESCRIPTION:

Repositories view: check for submodules when reacting on selection

When the repositories was set to follow the selection and a file in
a submodule folder was selected, the submodule repository was added
as a top-level repository in the view. Fix this by also considering
repositories under submodule nodes when determining which node to
show.

Add a new test, and fix SubmoduleFolderTest to properly commit the
addition of the submodule in setUp().

Line:1031, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> shouldn't this be conditional on non-null only? at least it was in patch set 2

Line:1031, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> It was, and that came from the base version, which also kept going through the remaining repo nodes if it didn't find the desired child under the matching node.

But I believe that doesn't make sense. None of the other nodes will match. So if the repo directory is the right one, we have found the single correct repo node, and it either has the child we're looking for or it doesn't, but we don't need to keep iterating over other repo nodes.

In fact this could be improved for the submodule part, too, which currently keeps going even if it found a matching submodule repo node, but that one didn't have the wanted child. I doubt it's worth doing that, though, since we're only looking for WORKING_TREE children, and I have yet to see a bare submodule. So in line 1042 childNode == null effectively means "no matching repo node found", and childNode != null means "repo node found, here's it's working tree". "repo node found, but it has no working tree" doesn't occur in that second "find submodule" loop.

I've restructured the code in PS 4 to make it clearer. First find the repo node, and if found then look once for the wanted child.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1031, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoriesView.java -> Looks much more clear now that those 2 concerns (repo, child) have been separated.
