DESCRIPTION:

Implement project rename and move for some cases

We can now move and rename projects within a repository for a number
of cases. Moving a project to a subdirectory does not work and since
Eclipse actually destroys the project, we simply forbid it for now
(Platform bug 307140). The bug is only worked around in Eclipse 3.7,
i.e. forbidden in the UI.

This also adds tests for move and delete of folders and files. We are
quite inconsistent with respect to how we handle the index so the
current behavior may not be the final behavior.

We cannot move projects with repositories inside them in this
version and so we forbid it. Disconnect and share manually
to accomplish this.

Still RFC-status. We need more tests and fix moving the repository. As I see it the Repository API has to change somehow for this to work, i.e. we must be able to disconnect all users or (option 2) verify that there are no users and abort if there are.
