DESCRIPTION:

[releng] Add a resource filter to top-level .project

Hide the "nested" projects from inside the top-level egit project.
No need to make the Eclipse resource tree twice as large, and
filtering also helps avoid duplicates being shown when searching.
(For instance, "Open Type" showed some classes twice when the egit
project was also imported in the workspace.)

I didn't immediately notice any difference when testing your change. Until I noticed I had _another_ egit project in my workspace. :)
Therefore someone please review https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/153062/ also.

We definitely need to copy your solution to several other projects. Basically every repository where someone imported the root as project (which is unfortunately done automatically using smart import, if I remember right).

I am trying to work on EGit from scratch.
I typically don't import all project at once because I rarely need to have them all open, and I'm usually happy with my current IDE used as target-platform and providing the bundles I won't modify so I don't have to open them.
When importing EGit, I just imported the root project and couldn't see the content. It took me some time (and expertise) to realize that a resource filter was probably already in place.
So, in my opinion, this change makes getting started to contribute even harder because it's too opinionated about how contributor should organize their workspace.
