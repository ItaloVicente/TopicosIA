DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Adds repository selection combo to the fetch gerrit change dialog

Removes the message that no repository is selected if the fetch gerrit
change dialog is called without a repository selected (e.g. via ctrl +
3).
Instead there is a combo selector on top of the dialog that lets the
user choose what repository he wants (even if a repository is selected).

Bug: 507733

Looks like it's going in the right direction.

Unit tests for the new functionality will be hard since we currently have no test Gerrit server, so we'll have to do good manual testing.

What do you think about the following: if the wizard is invoked without selected repo, we should after the fetch also figure out how to make the repo view, staging view, and history view switch to that repo. Chances are the user wants to see that repo then there, even if they had another repo selected before. (Would be something for a follow-up commit, though.)
Line:34, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/commands/shared/FetchChangeFromGerritCommand.java -> Should probably only consider repos configured for Gerrit.

Line:255, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> Do we need the combo if invoked with a selected repo? I don't think so. We could allow instantiating the wizard with a null repo, and make it only then add this combo and initialize to the first of them.

Line:266, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> Should probably only add repositories that are configured for Gerrit. Maybe we need a (static?) helper method getConfiguredGerritRepositories() that could be used here and in the command. Not sure where the best place for such a method might be; perhaps in GerritUtil.

Line:277, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> Indeed, yes. Pretty crucial, actually, because updating the uriCombo to a new selection will deal with the asynchronous content assist future.

Line:30, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangeWizard.java -> Keep the old constructors, please. Let's be nice to the EGerrit project. They use this wizard. (And yes, I know that it's been discontinued because Ericsson lost interest. And I told them several times to contact us so that we could figure out what kind of public API they'd need, and they didn't. Still no reason to gratuitously break their code if it doesn't put a burden on us. Here, keeping the old constructors around is no big deal.)

Line:255, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> +1, as user I'm frequently not aware of the current UI selection if I trigger a command.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Then let's add an empty after the 3).

Line:266, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> For a first version it's OK without. But we'll have to figure out something before we can release this into the wild. (See below: if a non-Gerrit enabled repo is chosen, I think we may end up with an empty uriCombo.)

Either we need to re-read all configs, but that may be too expensive if you have more than a handful of repos. (I have quite a few.) Or we need to cache (and persist that info so we can re-read it when Eclipse is started) such auxiliary info about repositories. Both would need to be done elsewhere, not here in this wizard. Or we need to loosen the restrictions in the uriCombo to show all remotes. But even then we somehow need to deal with repos without remotes. (Misconfigured, or simply local.) Do we also have to think about what to do with bare repos?

Line:277, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> I would have to try it myself, too. Setting up the combo initially is done on line 506ff. There you also can see why it's important to offer only Gerrit-configured repos in the repo selector: otherwise you may end up with an empty URI combo.

Once you're there, we may also have to revisit the content assist future business. I suspect some changes may be necessary if the repo can change.

Line:255, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> I thought it would be cool to always have the ability to change the repo (useful for a misclick on the wrong repo for example). This would also align the dialog to not look like it's two different dialogs.

Line:266, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/fetch/FetchGerritChangePage.java -> Should this be done in this commit? I had a look at GerritUtil and it looks like we would need to check every repository manually if it's a Gerrit repo. Maybe another helper function would be useful for that (if that's not already there.).
