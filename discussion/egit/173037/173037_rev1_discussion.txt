I don't quite understand. mylyn.commons was never in Orbit AFAIK? It was in simrel... At bug 564699 you wrote "otherwise we have to remove it from simrel": "it" being the egit mylyn integration? But we'd leave them in our p2 repo? What happens if a user upgrades from egit 5.9? I would suspect that p2 doesn't find a solution :-(.

Are these problems with xml.bind also the reason for not updating the Orbit link in the EGit p2 repo?

That's a coincidence. I tried to update Orbit to the latest S-build for RC1. At around the same time mylyn commons sdk feature was removed from simrel since it depends on outdated com.sun.xml.bind 2.2.0 which is replaced by a newer one in simrel. Due to this missing feature I couldn't generate egit-4.18-staging.target since the generator couldn't resolve the mylyn commons sdk feature. As a workaround I now use the one from the previous release. Looks like we may have to remove the egit mylyn integration from both simrel and our p2 repository if this isn't fixed until the final release.

no, my forgetfulness :-(
I should implement a script to update Orbit which doesn't forget that the Orbit in the EGit p2 repo also needs to be updated

That would be a pity because it will mean that if one has the 5.9 version of these bundles installed one cannot upgrade seamlessly to 5.10. IIRC p2 will not uninstall things on its own.
