DESCRIPTION:

Enable folder deletion in staging view via key

The deletion handler was only dealing with file based staging entries
until now. Make the selection check as well as the action execution
aware of recursively nested folder staging entries as well.

I think this should have a test. I know the code only deleted the children of the folder node, not those of the real on-disk directory, but to catch regression we should have a test for this. A folder x with two children a and b, only a staged. Delete invoked on folder x. Expected result: on disk x/a still exists, and x/b is gone.

What should happen if x is empty after the deletion? Should x itself also be deleted?

What happens if x in the staging view is not expanded? Does the user have a notification which files will be removed? I guess this makes it rather easy to accidentally delete files one didn't want to delete. (Just think of someone mistakenly having selected a folder.)

Of course, b staged, not a.

Patch Set 2: -Code-Review

Thomas, the handling of files or folders on disk did not change at all. E.g. all the elements that we deal with are StagingEntries for _files_, before and after my change. Selecting a folder staging entry only adds its (file) child entries from the view, the same as if you had selected these child nodes manually. The selection list dealt with in the code is exactly the same, whether you select the folder node, or all of its child nodes. My change only allows to create that selection list differently.

Due to only dealing with files, we cannot and do not delete empty directories, neither before nor after my change.

The staged and unstaged entries are in 2 separate trees, therefore a staged entry cannot accidentally be added to the deletion list in the unstaged view (what you suggest with the x/a and x/b files). Also that is independent of my change.

To summarize, the possible actions on the staged/unstaged file nodes are exactly the same as before. Do you agree it is not necessary to have additional testing for the effects of the file actions?

I expressed myself badly, sorry.

I *know* we delete only files present as StagingEntry objects in the viewer. The point is having a test that catches regressions if the code is ever changed.

On disk we have files x/a and x/b. x/a is changed, x/b isn't. Staging view shows only x/a in unstaged viewer. Folder x is selected, delete invoked. Test verifies that after execution x/b is still present (and x/a isn't).

And the point about accidentally deleting files was: files x, y/a, and z exist. They're all changed, so they show up in the unstaged viewer. y is not expanded, so the viewer shows x, y, z. User wants to delete x and z: selects x, wants to ctrl-click z but mistakenly uses shift-click. Invokes delete. Does the user have any indication that this will delete file y/a (which he doesn't even see since y is not expanded)?
