Michael, I haven't checked the code in the platform, but wouldn't make sense to allow platform code to support also File or Path inputs? How much changes does it need? I mean, everyone which would provide an adapter to Path or File would have that menu, instead of only repository view.

That definitely makes sense. Nevertheless we could merge this change, and then make it depend on the platform version afterwards (similar to how the trash icon depends on the platform version).
