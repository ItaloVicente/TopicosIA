DESCRIPTION:

Fix problem marker handling in staging view

Three problems:

1. Markers were displayed only on files and the direct parents if tree
   or compact tree layout was used, but not on folders higher up.
2. Marker changes were only accounted for if triggered by resource
   modifications. In that case, a new IndexDiff is calculated and the
   viewers get a completely new input, refreshing everything. Other
   marker changes, for instance deleting a marker in the problems view,
   were only reflected in the staging view in list mode.
3. Commit button enablement did not account for such marker changes
   (bug 499913).

Fixes:

1. In StagingFolderEntry use IResource.DEPTH_INFINITY instead of
   IResource.DEPTH_ONE.
2. The ProblemLabelDecorator only considered the root nodes of a tree
   viewer. Fix by also considering parent containers of changed
   resources, and when translating to viewer elements, descending into
   StagingFolderEntries that have marker changes.
3. ProblemLabelDecorator updated the affected viewer rows directly.
   Instead fire a LabelProviderChangedEvent. This also updates the
   affected viewer rows, but additionally makes it possible to listen
   to such events and update the commit buttons accordingly.
