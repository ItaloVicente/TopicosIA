Hi Thomas, i had a performance problem (with a big git project) in my egit and solved it. Would you mind to review the change?

Looks good; please see inline comments.
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Very terse :-) Would be helpful if the first line (shown in the history) was more precise, and if the body gave a bit more context. Something like:

  [performance] ResourceStateFactory: avoid string concatenation

  String concatenation allocates new objects, which may put extra
  pressure on the garbage collector. Avoid ephemeral object
  allocation in a hot spot in the ResourceStateFactory. In tests,
  this speeds up X by a factor of Y.

(and fill in X (where does one notice it best) and Y (how much is the improvement worth))

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please open an issue in Bugzilla for this, and link it here in the footers as

  Bug: <bugzilla number>
  Change-Id: ...

Can you give in the Bugzilla issue some indication on the measurable effects of this change?

As far as I see, this is the only such hot spot for this particular string concatenation. But there may be other places where such ephemeral allocations occur.

Line:362, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/resources/ResourceStateFactory.java -> Missing space?

  { //$NON-NLS-1$

Line:365, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/resources/ResourceStateFactory.java -> This is very old code; copied from DecoratableResourceAdapter where it was introduced in commit 45ecae45. That's why it doesn't have the curly braces. When we touch such code nowadays, we do supply the missing {} for the code bits touched. Please do so here, too.

Line:371, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/resources/ResourceStateFactory.java -> It may be obvious to us now, but if someone else looks at this in a few years I suspect it may not be ovious anymore why this should be faster. Would be worth mentioning " because it avoids extra String/StringBuilder allocations."

Is it worth extracting this into a separate method? I'd just inline that at the single call above (including the comment).

Line:371, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/resources/ResourceStateFactory.java -> containsPrefixPath stays more readable with abstracting the technical improvement in a seperate method which could also be reused. Considering runtime the compiler may inline it anyway.
