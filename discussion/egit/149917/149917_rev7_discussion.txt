DESCRIPTION:

Rely on ResourceRefreshJob to refresh after checkout

ResourceRefreshJob can refresh exactly the resources affected by a
checkout. Hence do not refresh on project granularity which is much more
expensive. We still have check for projects disappearing while checking
out another version.

Move ResourceRefreshJob to the egit core Activator. Now it must be
always active since we have no coarse grained secondary project refresh
anymore.

Use the eventId for RepositoryEvents which is introduced in JGit to
track per repository which WorkingTreeModifiedEvents have already been
processed by ResourceRefreshJob.

the build fails since this depends on the JGit change I176ed83e7177b3be35c1f50948a55118f3e2f733
which is still in review

Patch Set 7:

But we have a problem here. For instance ResetOperation.execute() is run inside a WorkspaceOperation, so it holds the workspace lock. The RRJ cannot refresh because the lock is held and blocks. Deadlock. You can't even shut down Eclipse because Activator.stop() will join on RRJ, but RRJ hangs waiting on the workspace lock, which is still held by the ResetOperation waiting for RRJ.

Perhaps using the job to do the refreshes isn't the right way. Maybe better to factor out the actual refresh logic and attach a (synchronous) listener for WorkingTreeModifiedEvent to the repo in each operation.

I also tried a cherry-pick. My test repo has one file only, and the cherry-pick produced a conflict. I didn't get a WorkingTreeModifiedEvent at all. That needs to be examined. I would have expected one.

CherryPickCommand should explicitly fire an event when there are conflicts. Looks like that was simply forgotten.

Because ResetActionHandler uses JobUtil.scheduleUserWorkspaceJob() to run the ResetOperation. Wouldn't be necessary as far as I see...

Perhaps fixing all this is just a matter of diligently checking how which operation is run in EGit. But has a high risk that we overlook some places.

I'll try the approach using a synchronous listener in another change

I think we go for the synchronous implementation
