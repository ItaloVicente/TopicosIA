DESCRIPTION:

Rely on ResourceRefreshJob to refresh after checkout

ResourceRefreshJob can refresh exactly the resources affected by a
checkout. Hence do not refresh on project granularity which is much more
expensive. We still have check for projects disappearing while checking
out another version.

Move ResourceRefreshJob to the egit core Activator. Now it must be
always active since we have no coarse grained secondary project refresh
anymore.

Line:559, org.eclipse.egit.core/src/org/eclipse/egit/core/Activator.java -> See the javadoc of Job.join():

"If the job has not been scheduled, this method returns immediately" and "If this method is called on a job that reschedules itself from within the <code>run</code> method, the join will return at the end of the first execution."

So this may return too early.

Also, what if it takes more that timeoutMillis milliseconds for the refreshjob to finish?

Furthermore, we sometimes do run things in parallel, for instance switching a branch in multiple repositories. All these may cause this job to be re-scheduled, so each individual branch operation would wait until finally all are done.

I suspect this needs quite a bit more. We'd need a way to wait until there are no more pending refreshes for a particular repository. Perhaps we need to split the listener and the job, and have one job per repo.
