DESCRIPTION:

Gracefully ignore linked resources

A project may contain resources that are not located within the
project's directory in the local file system. These resources are
referred to as linked resources. This patch adds a few checks to
gracefully ignore them in a few functional cases: iterator, handlers,
actions, etc.

It was my plan to submit this today, but I see Matthias was faster :).

Well done François! Remember for your next change, keep it as focused as possible, do refactorings (e.g. trackAllFiles in this change) as separate changes, which could have been merged right away.

I've made a couple edits to http://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/New_and_Noteworthy/2.3 to reflect this change.
Thanks everyone for reviewing and committing this change that has grown bigger than I expected. I certainly will pay more attention to the granularity of changes in the future!
