DESCRIPTION:

Gracefully ignore linked resources

A project may contain resources that are not located within the
project's directory in the local file system. These resources are
referred to as linked resources.
This patch adds a few checks to gracefully ignore them in a few
functional cases: iterator, handlers, actions, etc.

Rebased.

I tested the change a bit with a linked folder named root in org.eclipse.egit pointing to .. (the root of the egit repository working directory) and with resource filters for "org.eclipse.egit*".

This means that only the files such as README and the tools folder is visible.

I noticed a few things:

* The files from the tools folder is marked as deleted in the Staging view. Changing IteratorService to use isLinked(IResource.CHECK_ANCESTORS) fixes that (it used isLinked() before). Do you agree with this change?

* When editing README and saving, the change does not automatically show up in the Staging view. This is caused by GitResourceDeltaVisitor skipping the resource. When removing this, it works. What is the reason behind this? I didn't notice anything being wrong with the lines removed.
