DESCRIPTION:

Remove trailing whitespaces when saving file

'Save action' for java editor enabled and configured to remove all
trailing whitespaces. All other actions disabled. Actually only these are
significant:

  editor_save_participant_org.eclipse.jdt.ui.postsavelistener.cleanup=true
  sp_cleanup.remove_trailing_whitespaces=true
  sp_cleanup.remove_trailing_whitespaces_all=true
  sp_cleanup.remove_trailing_whitespaces_ignore_empty=false

But Eclipse needs all unused settings to be set to false explicitly.

Message: 
Rewriting lines just for the sake of cleaning up whitespace or removing closing braces alters the line.  It becomes harder to blame that line back through the original history of the project.  I think git.git did that once, and eventually got through the whole code base, but they also only had a few spots impacted.  Pretty much all of our javadoc has trailing whitespace errors.

Fixing all of this in the current code base is just code churn.  EGit and JGit are fairly mature code bases.  We try not to churn code unless there is some major benefit to doing it... and even then we want it incrementally in small units that can be digested.

Auto formatting of edited lines during save, I can't agree with, because sometimes I don't like the way the Eclipse formatter is laying out the line.  Sometimes I'll try to rename variables or pull something into a utility method to get a better line breaking, but sometimes I'll just give up and format the line to be as readable as I think I can make it.  If Eclipse is going to just wreck that on save, that sucks.

Removing unnecessary blocks, same thing, see my comment in your change that tried to enable that asking about unnecessary curly braces around a block with a large comment and a single line of code.

Regarding style issues being inefficient in the workflow, sure, it might be more difficult for someone who is new to the project to write code "in the project style".  But to be perfectly honest, our project is old enough that project style is "match surrounding code as best as you can", and there's a lot of that code present to use as an example.  This is good practice in almost *any* project you work on.  

If a contributor can't be bothered to match surrounding style, we also have to wonder how much they really understanding the neighboring code that may or may not be affected by the change they are trying to make to the logic.

Further, we have contributors to JGit who aren't Eclipse users.  They can't rely on Eclipse auto formatting, auto save, auto bug fix, auto whatever.  If the problem here is that "match surrounding code" isn't a sufficient rule for style and a more detailed guide is needed, we need to document that for any contributor, and especially for those who prefer not to use Eclipse.  Yes, that's horrible, not using Eclipse on an Eclipse hosted project, but that's the reality, JGit has contributors who aren't Eclipse users, and we'll lose them if the only way they can be an effective contributor is to switch their IDE and tools.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this; No score

My problem with this change is it makes it very hard to selectively edit part of a file which already has trailing whitespace on its lines.

E.g. many of our source files have trailing whitespace in Javadoc comments ("\t* \n" are empty comment line).  If you only modify a couple lines of code in a method, and save, this triggers Eclipse to rewrite most of the file fixing those comments.

Are we going to clean up the existing source files first?

Sounds like a good idea; that way, we don't have this problem. Also, we should check the tabs vs spaces thing - I wonder if that's why they appeared normal to me but broken to Shawn?

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Let's do a format of existing lines to bring them up to speed and then we can fix this subsequently. Having things removed on save will save everyone time and effort later ...

Shawn: This is for egit only, not JGit. Though I in principle agree on avoiding non-contributing patches, whitespace is a special case.

It's possible to choose between the whole file and modified lines for formatter. But not for additional actions like removing trailing white spaces.

It would be better to clean up the existing source files now when there are not so many contributions, these changes are trivial and they wouldn't affect many people.

Uploading patches and reviewing them several times just because of the trivial style issues seems to me not a best workflow ;-)

So my POV on this issue:
- Enable save actions 'Format edited lines', 'Remove unnecessary blocks' and 'Remove trailing white spaces on all lines'.
- Apply these rules to the existing source files now.
