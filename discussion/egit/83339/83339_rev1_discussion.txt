DESCRIPTION:

Fix drag&drop in staging view

Drag&drop offers a FileTransfer, but considered only StagingEntries.
If only StagingFolderEntries were selected, the resulting FileTransfer
would be empty, which is not allowed and produces a SWTException,
making the drag&drop fail.

This is especially devastating on GTK, where the FileTransfer sometimes
gets created up front, and thus even drags between our own two viewers
failed frequently. On Mac, the FileTransfer is created lazily when
hovering over an item (such as a Finder window) that accepts such
transfers, and the problem thus went largely unnoticed there.

Try to alleviate this by also considering folders and including the
staged or unstaged files contained in those folders when creating a
FileTransfer. This is still not a complete solution; transfers may
still fail if the selection includes only deleted files. A complete
solution is only possible by removing support for FileTransfer
completely. Which might make sense anyway: a plain drag&drop (no
modifier keys pressed) from the staging view to a Finder window on my
Mac results in a move, and the original file is consequently removed,
resulting in very surprising behavior: a staged file suddenly appears
as an unstaged deletion!

Also reduce code duplication by factoring out the creation of the
staged and unstaged viewers into a common method.

Additionally, ensure that dropping onto the same staged or unstaged
viewer the drag&drop initially started from is a no-op; otherwise this
did inadvertently stage/unstage other files contained in selected
folders.
