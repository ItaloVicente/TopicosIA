DESCRIPTION:

Don't use virtual memory mapping in WindowCache on Windows

Using virtual memory mapping has issues on Windows, especially it
prevents moving or deleting mmap'ed packfiles. Hence don't enable it on
Windows by default. On Windows show a warning tooltip for this option.

Line:1048, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> What does that tell me as a user? If I'm on Windows, under which circumstances is it OK to switch this on, and when should I rather not do that?

From the bug and the linked web sites I rather understood that I shouldn't use this on Windows at all. So maybe not offer the option at all on Windows?

Line:1048, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/uitext.properties -> This option was always configurable, that's why I just reverted the change of default which I implemented in March.
Back then I had changed the default to avoid that EGit has to allocate this cache on the heap.

Do you think we should hard-code the setting on Windows to switch off mmap'ing and disable the field editor on the preference page?

I'm no expert on Windows or on mmap. Whence my question. If it should never be enabled on Windows, I wouldn't give the option to switch it on at all... if there are circumstances under which it may make sense for a user to switch this on on Windows, then yes, give him the option, but then we need to explain better under which circumstances this can be safely done.

Remains the question of what to do if someone has it switched on right now and we remove the switch in the preference page. There will be no clear way to switch it off anymore... unless we always force it to off on Windows.

But as I said: I don't know what needs to be done, but I find the tooltip text not exactly helpful. Most people won't know what a packfile is, or what not being able to delete one implies. (For instance, does this cause trouble with GC?)

Since I have no practical experience on Windows since years I can't say if this option is useful on Windows and under which conditions it is safe to use. Hence I tend to hardcode this option to false on Windows.

@Michael: AFAIK you work on Windows. Did you notice any difference since this mmap setting was enabled by default? Positive or negative?

I must admit I don't remember any notable change in experience since March, but I also did not specifically look for something in that area. What would make some good testing scenario to be run once with the option enabled and once disabled?

Regarding the file locks on pack files: I've first commented on those in July at https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=439305#c4, but probably because I tried to get tests running, not necessarily because of more problems due to the option.

And as a last thing: Would it make sense to ask for instance in the official gerrit mailing list, whether there are people running gerrit on windows with that option enabled, and what their experience is? Basically trying to find other users with the same setup.

I found a rather simple criteria now: Running the egit.core unit test suite repeatedly. The results are:
* 48-49 failing tests with mmap=true
* 19-22 failing tests with mmap=false

The fixed tests previously all reported packfile deletion failures. So changing the option back to not use mmap on Windows seems a good idea.

Regarding the question of whether the option should be available at all: Since we all seem not to know of a good reason to enable the option on Windows, I'm in favor of not providing it in the UI on Windows, and hardcoding it to false. This can easily be changed again when some user can give a concrete usage scenario, but until then it might save us some bug reports regarding locked files.
