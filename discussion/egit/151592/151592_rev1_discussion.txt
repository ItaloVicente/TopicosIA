DESCRIPTION:

[repo view] allow decoration for repository nodes

Decoration of tree nodes was disabled (commit e82658e, Bug: 544600). The
argument was that decoration is not done. However, git flow provides a
decorator which is currently not shown.

With this change, decoration is allowed for repository nodes.

Line:150, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/repository/RepositoryTreeNodeLabelProvider.java -> I know. :-) Don't you get blinking decorations now? On refresh, the decorator briefly disappears before it re-appears when the background decorator has done its job. Compare bug 130340; especially the last comment.

Any idea how to avoid that? I'd _love_ to have all these image decorations in the decorator, not in the label provider, but so far I haven't found a way to do so without this flickering. For label texts, there's this hyper-ugly work-around with appending a blank.

I do see the decorator disappearing and reappearing, but I have no idea how to fix that correctly. I did a little bit of debugging (well, I inserted some sysouts).

a) There are quite a few calls to getImage when performing the refresh, one when creating the tree item and two updates to the same item afterwards. I don't know if they are all necessary.
b) More interestingly, it seems to be a race condition - at least in the particular case of the GitFlowDecorator.

What I did was insert a sysout in GitFlowLightweightDecorator#decorateIcons and one in my modified RepositoryTreeNodeLabelProvider#getImage. In the latter, I stored the image from the super call in a variable and printed its hash code to the console before returning it.

What I noticed was that without setting a breakpoint, the first image (create tree item) was obtained *before* the git flow decoration was invoked, so the hash code of the first image was different from the next two invokatons (after decoration was invoked).

When I set a breakpoint in the getImage-Method, the git flow decoration is invoked before the first image is obtained and all three images have the same hashcode. Maybe LightweightDecoration is not the right choice here!?

Not a race condition, unfortunately. The first time, no decoration is computed, so the decorating label provider just returns the unadorned base image and queues a decoration request. This request is handled in the background vbia the lightweight decorator, and once done, the an event is fired that causes the viewer to refresh the label. It calls the decorating label provider again, which gets the image again, but this time the decorations are there, and thus it returns the decorated image.

All normal. And using a LightweightDecorator _is_ the way to go -- we really don't want to compute all this stuff on the UI thread.

I haven't figured out yet how package explorer or project explorer manage to avoid that blinking effect. Either we're doing something wrong somewhere, or it doesn't occur for them because of using the Eclipse resource tree and ResourceChangedEvents, or their decorators are just so fast one doesn't notice it. Another speciality of the RepositoriesView is that it schedules its own refresh job -- maybe the perceptible delay until the decorations are there again comes from that.

I'm working on making these decorators faster anyway; I may revisit this once I have that done. But if you find a solution before that (and that doesn't move even more into the UI thread) it'd be OK, too.

Thanks for the clarification. It is not really an issue for me.
I just noticed that the icon styling was different in the view and in the delete repository group confirmation dialog - there the overlay was present.
