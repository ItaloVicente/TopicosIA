DESCRIPTION:

Fix history preference page field editor layout

BooleanFieldEditors manipulate the GridLayout of their composite parent.
We therefore need to fix the layout after adding the field editors.

See screenshots in bugzilla.

Line:100, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/HistoryPreferencePage.java -> This text constant says "Shorten long tag and branch names at start". I had trouble understanding what that meant. At the start of what? Of the Eclipse IDE? I had to look up in the code what we do when it's set to grok it. Please rephrase to
"Elide long tag and branch names at the front (... at the beginning)" or some such.

Line:101, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/HistoryPreferencePage.java -> Alternative: move this last BooleanFieldEditor up to before the IntegerFieldEditors (line 86). Then you don't need this fixGridLayout at all.

This layout framework is crazy spaghetti. See comment below. In this case, since moving this last BooleanFieldEditor up looks better anyway, I'd go for that solution.

Line:121, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/HistoryPreferencePage.java -> Bah. This FieldEditorPreferencePage and its FieldEditors are crap. The individual editors allassumethattheirparentis the fieldEditorParent; if there are intermediate composites, everything goes wonky.

The adjustGridLayout at the end is not needed, super.createControl() will do that anyway. But it'll set the fieldEditorParent to have 2 columns, not the groups. An that's the reason why all our groups need a horizontal span of 2.

In CommittingPreferencePage we have the same thing but with an IntegerFieldEditor at the end: that one will set the group's layout to two columns. So there it works by chance, but will fail as soon as one adds another BooleanFieldEditor after the integer field.

Yuck yuck yuck.

In any case, this second fixGridLayout call is not needed, and neither is the adjustGridLayout below.

Would have to check whether these editors also fiddle with the margins. If not, why not set the margins up front correctly?

Line:100, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/HistoryPreferencePage.java -> Done. However, I left "shorten" instead of "elide". I consider myself fluent in English, but I've never heard that word before, so I assume that many other users would have a similar problem understanding this.

Line:101, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/HistoryPreferencePage.java -> Done. Yes, much more simple solution.

Line:121, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/preferences/HistoryPreferencePage.java -> In fact, they manipulate the margins. I've now documented that in the Javadoc.
