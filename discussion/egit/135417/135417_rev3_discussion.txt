DESCRIPTION:

Make merge viewers react better on outside changes

Use the standard LocalResourceTypedElement from Platform Team for
editable items backed by an IResource instead of our own
ResourceEditableRevision. Likewise, use LocalNonWorkspaceTypedElement
for editable items backed by a non-workspace File. Make the latter
provide a FileStoreEditorInput. Using standard editor inputs as in
normal editors makes the merge editors pick up changes done elsewhere
and vice versa. Unfortunately the class needs to be a subclass of
LocalResourceTypedElement because the framework makes a number of
"instanceof" tests, but we have to override a number of more methods
to ensure that the right SharedDocumentAdapter (and byte buffer if not
connected) is used.

EditableRevision thus is only for "Compare with Index", i.e., editable
index items. LocationEditableRevision and ResourceEditableRevision
are used for conflict resolutions with "Last HEAD (unmerged)" as input.
In this case it's not possible to provide an editor input that would
match normal inputs for IResources or Files: the initial content must
come from the index stage 2, and the behavior if the (pre-merged)
working tree file is edited in parallel in another editor is confusing
anyway.

LocalFileRevision is deleted. It was originally copied from Platform
Team, but it's the wrong abstraction. It is intended for comparisons
with the local history, which are never handled by EGit, but was used in
EGit to represent an IFile in the working tree. But EGit also already
had its own WorkspaceFileRevision and WorkingTreeFileRevision for
representing items in the working tree, so use those instead. Remove
label computation code related to LocalFileRevision.

I've reviewed the changes, but that is completely over my head, so I cannot really judge this. Sorry.
Line:92, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/revision/LocationEditableRevision.java -> I've seen the use of the new Objects.hash method before, but never like this, or-ed with the super value. Is there some documentation available about this pattern?

(I typically generate those methods using the 3rd and 4th option of the eclipse wizard, and that produces different code)

Line:57, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/revision/ResourceEditableRevision.java -> using an annotation on one argument, and an assertion on another looks slightly confusing :)

Line:92, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/revision/LocationEditableRevision.java -> I never had problems with xor-ing hashes. Don't know if something like (super.hashCode * 31) + Objects.hash(...) is
any better.

Line:57, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/revision/ResourceEditableRevision.java -> Yes, perhaps I should just leave this as it was. I'll have to check why I didn't use @NonNull on the runnableContext. Probably because it caused null-warnings at the call sites.

Line:57, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/revision/ResourceEditableRevision.java -> @NonNull IFile file resolves a null warning on the super call (getResourceEncoding(file) in line 55).

Adding a @NonNull on IRunnableContext gives indeed null warnings at the call sites.

Not sure what the best approach would be:
* Leave as it was and accept the null warning on line 55.
* Leave as is.
* Add @NonNull to IRunnableContext and add (actually unnecessary) null checks at call sites.

Line:92, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/revision/LocationEditableRevision.java -> Xor would only be a problem if the two values could ever be the same. (a==b => a^b==0)

We have other places where we use xor to combine hashes. Maybe changing them all to 31*a + b would be safer...

But if so, we should do it for all in a follow-up commit.

Line:92, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/revision/LocationEditableRevision.java -> Done in these two classes (LocationEditableRevision and ResourceEditableRevision) in PS 4.

Line:57, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/revision/ResourceEditableRevision.java -> Done (third option) in PS 4.
