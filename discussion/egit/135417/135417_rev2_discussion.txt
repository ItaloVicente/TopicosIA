DESCRIPTION:

Make merge viewers react better on outside changes

Use the standard LocalResourceTypedElement from Platform Team for
editable items backed by an IResource instead of our own
ResourceEditableRevision. Likewise, use LocalNonWorkspaceTypedElement
for editable items backed by a non-workspace File. Make the latter
provide a FileStoreEditorInput. Using standard editor inputs as in
normal editors makes the merge editors pick up changes done elsewhere
and vice versa. Unfortunately the class needs to be a subclass of
LocalResourceTypedElement because the framework makes a number of
"instanceof" tests, but we have to override a number of more methods
to ensure that the right SharedDocumentAdapter (and byte buffer if not
connected) is used.

EditableRevision thus is only for "Compare with Index", i.e., editable
index items. LocationEditableRevision and ResourceEditableRevision
are used for conflict resolutions with "Last HEAD (unmerged)" as input.
In this case it's not possible to provide an editor input that would
match normal inputs for IResources or Files: the initial content must
come from the index stage 2, and the behavior if the (pre-merged)
working tree file is edited in parallel in another editor is confusing
anyway.

LocalFileRevision is deleted. It was originally copied from Platform
Team, but it's the wrong abstraction. It is intended for comparisons
with the local history, which are never handled by EGit, but was used in
EGit to represent an IFile in the working tree. But EGit also already
had its own WorkspaceFileRevision and WorkingTreeFileRevision for
representing items in the working tree, so use those instead. Remove
label computation code related to LocalFileRevision.

As far as I see, this works now well, even (within limits) for non-workspace Xtext files. (Tested with TPD.)

With Xtext, there are a few idiosyncrasies we cannot get around:

* "Show whitespace" just doesn't work for non-workspace items (non-workspace files or index/commit blobs). This is due to the implementation of Xtext's DefaultMergeViewer. Nothing we can do about it.
* While concurrent editing works nicely for text files, Xtext implements its own mechanism that is different. The user gets asked whether he wants to reload a file if it's been modified outside an Xtext editor. In the compare editor, the user gets asked upon save if there have been concurrent modifications.

There is one problem I have not figured out why it occurs: when a non-workspace Xtext file is edited and saved, the staging view does not update. This works fine for text files. I have not been able to figure out what is different in the save implementation in an Xtext editor. It _does_ work in the compare editor (for instance, compare a Xtext file (not in the workspace) from a commit with the non-workspace file in the working tree, then edit and save it in the compare editor). The work-around is to refresh the staging view explicitly. Since non-workspace Xtext files should be rare I do not consider this a problem that should block this change.
