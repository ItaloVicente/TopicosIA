DESCRIPTION:

Fix silent failure on conflicting checkout after branch creation.

* Minor changes in BranchOperationUI to re-use checkout result handling.
* Add UI test because the issue is tedious to reproduce, and depends on
  proper synchronization with the Job and the Display thread.

Right, it would be OK to use BranchOperationUI in the handlers, though the BranchOperation is triggered in the handlers. I would need to turn that off via some flag when running the operations from the handlers, and then duplicate the logic using BranchOperationUI. This would feel like the beginning of a "spaghetti" to me. Or did you have something different in mind?
