DESCRIPTION:

Open the clone wizard when a git URL is dropped anywhere on Eclipse

Created new GitUrlChecker class that allows for checking strings to
see if it is a proper git URL. You are now able to drag and drop a git
URL into a running workspace to spawn a clone wizard (implemented by
GitCloneDropAdapter).

GitCloneDropAdapter is copied from MarketplaceDropAdapter with minor
modifications (run clone wizard, resolve compiler warnings, improve a
misleading exception handler).

When the clipboard contains multi-line text that starts with a valid git URL on the first line and the git clone wizard is then opened normally (not via DND), we end up with the full multi-line text in the text field.

Anyway, since I found it faster to fix this and clean up the remaining issues than writing yet another review I've gone ahead and made the fixes.
