DESCRIPTION:

[merge] Hide changes between ancestor and current for cherry-pick

By default hide these changes. The ancestor in a cherry-pick is a
parent commit of 'theirs' (the commit that was cherry-picked); the
differences between that parent and the current version are simply
not interesting and even misleading.

Add an action to the content merge viewer's toolbar to allow the user
to toggle this setting for three-way comparisons.

Made one little change: suppress changes that occur only between left and ancestor only if the input is not "Working tree (pre-merged by git)". That version contains conflict markers, and those always occcur only on the left, so they'd always be suppressed. But then they are too easily missed. The user still has the toolbar button to switch modes, which helps to suppress irrelevant changes.

I think we might even drop "Working tree (pre-merged by git)" completely in favor of "Working tree merged to 'ours'".

In your example, it works very well for WindowCursor.

For PackFile, the results are not ideal no matter what input is chosen. However, the differences between PackFile(master) and PackFile(stable-5.9) are so big (there's been a complete refactoring) that the diff should never apply. The new exists() method must not be added to PackFile at all.

The result is also not ideal if left = "working tree pre-merged to ours" and right = "working tree pre-merged to theirs". Although that gives indeed a diff that matches the git conflict markers exactly, that diff isn't useful either. It would include also the ObjectLoader get(...) and the resolve() methods, which also should not be added to the master version of PackFile at all. It would apply and be syntactically correct, but would fail compilation.

With left = "working tree pre-merged to ours", right = stage 3 from index (theirs), and changes only between left and ancestor suppressed, I get a conflict in the imports and and an incoming addition of just the exists() method, which the Eclipse diff machinery would insert in a place where the result would be syntactically invalid. I do actually consider this a better comparison in this case; I see immediately that something is badly wrong. In this case, "wrong" means the versions differ so much that applying the change from one to the other is simply not possible.

Moreover, the results of doing the cherry-pick with command-line git 2.18.0 and with JGit differ.

Command-line git produces exactly what is shown in the EGit merge editor with this change when left = "working tree merged to 'ours'" and right = stage 3 (theirs), and changes between left and ancestor are hidden.

JGit records a different conflict in the working tree file.

I agree this cherry-pick for PackFile is an extreme example
