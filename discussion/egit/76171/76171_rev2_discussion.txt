DESCRIPTION:

RFC: redesign history search widget

Use a pop-up widget in the top-left corner of the history view as
suggested in the bug report.

Four minor problems:
* Visual updates for keeping the pop-up in the top-left corner lag
  a little bit when the view is resized.
* Finding the correct position is not as clean as I would have liked.
  A method somewhere to obtain that top-left corner of a view part's
  main content control might be helpful.
* The pop-up is done using a shell. SWT/JFace does not seem to have
  support for shells that auto-resize to the size of their contents.
  At least I haven't found anything and have thus implemented my own
  work-around.
* Moving the history view between windows closes the pop-up if the
  shell cannot be re-parented.

Looks way better IMHO. 

Note: Sometimes the result is cut of. See http://imgur.com/iFJKi14 

Would also be nice to have shortcuts for next and previous.

I like the new widget, nice :-)

could you 
* adapt styling to the underlying form-based view which has a pretty whitish background
* suppress the shadow

I think the widget should recompute the search result when the selection in the combo changes, e.g. from "comments" to "author". Also when the widget has a search term and then is hidden and shown again the search result should be recomputed automatically

"cut off": I know. Is a SWT on GTK problem. Works perfectly on my Mac.

"shortcuts": up and down arrow (as in the old implementation).

"background": will try, but I suspect this will be quite a bit of work (theme changes)... hard-coding it to "whitish" won't do.

"shadow": if there is a style constant in SWT for this, yes. Otherwise, no. I'd like to stay away from platform-specific stuff. The shadow is part of the SWT shell implementation on Mac. On GTK, there is no such shadow (see Lars's screenshot).

"recomputing": (1) on search scope drop-down changes: OK. Will have to check whether the old implementation did so. (2) on re-open: not sure if that's really convenient. It can be done, of course.

Could someone test this on Windows, please? That's the one platform that I don't have...

For Styling: please note that you should avoid hard-code Styling. In Neon we are planning to change the Form based Styling to a flat gray approach. Should be in the next daily build as of tomorrow.

Re: "On GTK, there is no such shadow (see Lars's screenshot)" -- I must be blind. :-) There _is_ one. Hm. I thought when I tried it on GTK, I didn't have one. Anyway, I'll try.
