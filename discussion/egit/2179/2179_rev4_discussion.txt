DESCRIPTION:

Let user know when the configuration file is not editable

We may not be able to determine the location of the config file. This
would happen when no C Git can be found, since the "system wide"
configuration file is located relative to the git executable.

The config file may also be owned by root or be non-writeable
for other reasons.
