DESCRIPTION:

[merge] Record in index whether conflicting file has been updated

When the merge input preference is set to "Last HEAD (unmerged)", EGit
uses the index stage 2 ('ours') as input. This is the version as it
was, without pre-merged content.

If the user then edits this version and saves, the new contents are
written to the working tree.

Previously, opening the merge editor then again on the same (not yet
resolved, i.e., still unstaged) conflict file would again show the
'ours' version, without the previously saved edits. For the user, his
previous edits appear lost even though they were saved.

Change GitMergeEditorInput to record in the git index whether the file
had been saved. The "last modified time" of a conflict stage has no
meaning in the git index, and is normally set to zero both in C git
and in JGit. EGit now changes the "last modified time" of the first
conflict stage to the current time upon saving, and before opening
the 'ours' side checks that timestamp and takes the working tree file
if the timestamp is not zero. That way the merge editor re-opens with
the last saved content including the user's edits.

Matthias, do you have time to look at this series? If not, I'd appreciate at least a second opinion on this change here (using the conflict stage timestamp as a flag), and perhaps on the hidden resource handling introduced in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/egit/egit/+/180108 . The rest I'd be ready to submit with self-reviews.

Note: this change here does not yet solve the following scenario:

1. Merge produces conflicts
2. User edits the workspace file and saves.
3. User opens merge editor with stage 2 as input.

This still just shows stage 2 instead of the edited file. I have no idea how to solve that.

I already started reviewing it, hope I can finish this until rc1

Line:398, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/merge/GitMergeEditorInput.java -> interesting approach, I tried to break it running native git commands but it seems to work :-)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:398, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/merge/GitMergeEditorInput.java -> I verified as best as I could that C git does write a zero timestamp, and doesn't make use of the field for conflict stages.

If C git ever starts using this timestamp, it will be != EPOCH, and EGit will simply fall back to not using stage 2 at all but the working tree file. Since it won't use stage 2, it'll also not modify the timestamp in the index.

So it should be safe; in the worst case, the user would not get shown stage 2, would file a bug, and we'd have to figure out a different fix.

Not that I know a different fix. I thought long and hard about this, and this was the only way I saw. Best would be if we had a stage 4 in the index, corresponding to the pre-merged working tree content, with proper timestamp. Then we could in the treewalk compare the OIDs from the FileTreeIterator and from index stage 4 to know whether the on-disk file has changed, and then use the on-disk file. But that would have to be done first in C git, and I suspect adding such a stage 4 would break older git implementations that expect at most 3 stages.
