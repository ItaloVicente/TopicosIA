DESCRIPTION:

[staging] Support wildcard filter

This adds support for the "*" as wildcard character in the staging view
filter. On change of the filter input it gets converted to a compiled
regex pattern, such that repeated filtering calls in the staged changes
list do not lead to re-compilation.

I think the regex should be anchored at the front with "^". Otherwise a filter like "e*" will display all files containing an "e" somewhere.

That may make sense if there are no wildcards, and it's the current behavior. But with wildcards it's a bit confusing. How would I filter for files beginning with "e" only? And with wildcards, I could write "*e*" to show only files containing an "e" anywhere...

Since the current (no wildcard) behavior is like that, maybe anchor the regex only if it does contain wildcards?
Line:2955, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Learned something new today... nevertheless, personally I find it clearer to use Pattern.compile(regex, Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE) instead.

Line:2955, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> That looks needlessly complicated. Why not simply "\\*" ?

Line:2958, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> There might also be a \Q\E at the front, if the filter starts with an asterisk.

Line:2959, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> This never returns null. So getFilterPattern() never returns null after the filter has been edited once, even if it is cleared. Perhaps return null if filter.isEmpty()? (Or filter.trim().isEmpty()?)

I implemented the "match at the front if contains wildcard" behavior. During tests that feels natural. From a viewpoint of symmetry we could also anchor at the end if a wildcard is there, but to me that seems counterintuitive for normal usage, since it would require an input of "*partialName*" instead of "*partialName" to match at all.
Line:2955, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/staging/StagingView.java -> Done. In our company, there are too many developers which always used character escaping for each metacharacter. Since that has a big chance of human error, we switched to a policy allowing only \\Q...\\E or Pattern.quote(...). That may look verbose for small input, but other developers can easily read the intended quotation, instead of decoding double and quadruple backslashes in their heads everytime. :)
