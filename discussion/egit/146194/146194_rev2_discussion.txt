DESCRIPTION:

Put a "presentation" button in the unstaged viewer's toolbar

Adds a button to switch the file presentation in both the unstaged
and staged viewers between list mode, tree mode, and compact tree
mode to the toolbar of the unstaged viewer, where we already have
the button to switch the sort order that also affects both viewers.
Re-uses the actions defined for the view menu. The button changes
its icon depending on the mode chosen.

A first implementation made selecting the button cycle through
the presentations, but that introduced a usability problem: when
clicked and the presentation switched to list mode, the two buttons
for "expand all" and "collapse all" would be hidden. The mouse would
then suddenly be over the "stage selected files" button. A user who'd
mistakenly click twice might inadvertently stage things he hadn't
wanted to stage.

Thus this implementation now simple shows the drop-down menu also
when the button is selected, not only when the arrow is selected.
When the user selects an entry from the drop-down menu and the
toolbar changes, the mouse won't be over any of the buttons.

Note that the staging view reacts only upon the next refresh or
repository switch on changes of the "Maximum number of lines"
preference that governs the automatic switching to tree mode. Thus
when this preference is changed to a higher value and the view
currently is in that forced tree mode, the "list" menu item may
remain disabled until the next refresh. That issue is unrelated
to this change, though. (But it is made more visible.)

> looking at all the menu details you implemented. :)

Not the first time I do this ;-) I've now factored out the common stuff to have better re-use and less copy-paste programming.
