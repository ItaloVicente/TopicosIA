DESCRIPTION:

Remove help button (? icon) from dialogs

Most EGit dialogs showed a help button that was unusable, i.e. did not
link to correct documentation but only opened a generic help pane.
This patch removes the help buttons for all Classes extending
org.eclipse.jface.dialogs.TitleAreaDialog.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

This probably makes sense. In the future, we should attach help to these dialogs once we create some help contexts within our doc plug-in. However, we aren't there yet.
