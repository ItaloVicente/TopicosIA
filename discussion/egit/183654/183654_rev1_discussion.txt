DESCRIPTION:

Allow the removal of a repository from the RepositoryCache

In the case that a repository is reinitialized such that the Work Tree
changes then the cache appears to retain inconsistent data. This can be
resolved by removing the repository from the cache followed by adding it
back, but no method to remove an individual repository existed prior.

Patch Set 1:

Please bear with me, and excuse whatever mistakes I made in submitting this patch; this is my first time both contributing to an opensource project that I don't alone maintain as well as my first time using Gerrit. I tried following the Contributor Guide, but it seems as though I made some blunders along the way. Namely, it appears I've run into merge-conflicts and in attempt to resolve those I may have ruined the Relation Chain associated with my series of commits. I'm not entirely sure what I am to do at this point and would appreciate guidance from someone who has the time to help me understand!
