DESCRIPTION:

RepositoryFinder to work with linked folders

When displaying the path to a repository contained within a linked
folder, use the path of the linked folder within the project as
the prefix of the repository location as the repository location
string is relative to that folder.

When a tree node is selected without a project, use the parent tree
node to acquire the project.
