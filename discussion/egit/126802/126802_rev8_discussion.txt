DESCRIPTION:

Add support for multi repository selection for switching branches

When multiple repositories are selected the Switch To... option
will display only the branches that are present in all of the
repositories. By clicking in any of them, the user will concurrently
switch branches for all the repositories. If the list of branches is
to be empty, a disabled menu item will be added to show that no
matching branches were found.

OK, so far this looks good now and displays the menu nicely. So now we could continue with doing the multi-switch in one job. Perhaps in a follow-up commit.

Once you've fixed the committer, I think we could merge https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/126801/ . That one is fine and stands on its own.

This one here I'd like to merge once we have the "one-job" implementation, at least for the precondition checks.
Line:4, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could you please set user.name = Luís Copetti and fix the "committer" for these two changes?

I'll be offline Aug 26 to Sep 3, so I can continue reviewing changes for this only then. 

Thanks already for the good work, this is definitely going in the right direction.
