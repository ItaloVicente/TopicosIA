DESCRIPTION:

Add support for multi repository selection for switching branches

When multiple repositories are selected the Switch To... option
will display only the branches that are present in all of the
repositories. By clicking in any of them, the user will concurrently
switch branches for all the repositories. If the list of branches is
to be empty, a disabled menu item will be added to show that no
matching branches were found.

Thanks for the tip!

This is the first ministep for the implementation, which is to have the label change according to the number of repositories selected. I ended up having to create another property tester because none of the others guaranteed a multi-repository selection.

While testing, I actually notice that maybe the property tester for 'projectsSingleRepository' could be improved. Because if I select a project in the project explorer and one random folder from another project, the 'Switch To' option is still visible. I was thinking that maybe I could fix this with another patch so as to not over clutter this one. What do you think?

Is jenkins stable? It is notifying me of failure but it appears to not be related to code and more to infrastructure.

The problem is not the infrastructure but a broken target platform definition. You need to rebase onto the latest origin/master. There was a problem in the target platform, see commits https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/127547/ (switched to httpclient 4.5.5) and https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/127634/ (fixed the problem).

Line:357, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.properties -> Typo.

Line:4071, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> I didn't try it yet, but I think this would need a property test, too. Otherwise it'll be active if I select two nodes in the same repository, won't it?

Line:135, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/selection/SelectionPropertyTester.java -> Can't we just do

   Repository[] repositories = SelectionUtils.getRepositories(selection);

   if (repositories.length < 2) {
     return false;
   }

   return Arrays.stream(repositories).allMatch(...);

?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:135, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/selection/SelectionPropertyTester.java -> I don't think so, It seems that if we use it that way, we  get valid repositories from nodes in the repository view as well, which ends up making the 'Team > Switch Repositories To' menu show up in the Repo view. I knew to try that based on the comment for the property: 'resourcesSingleRepository'
