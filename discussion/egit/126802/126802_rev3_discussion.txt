DESCRIPTION:

Add support for multi repository selection for switching branches

When multiple repositories are selected the Switch To... option
will display only the branches that are present in all of the
repositories. By clicking in any of them, the user will concurrently
switch branches for all the repositories. If the list of branches is
to be empty, a disabled menu item will be added to show that no
matching branches were found.

Thanks for the quick review, I appreciated it. By the way, I also noticed that I had not considered what would happen when one or more of the user's multi-selection consisted of a non-repository resource. I fixed that by applying a stricter property filter so that the 'Switch To...' option will not be visible when that happens.

Works nicely. Could we have a test that actually executes such a multi-repo branch switch and that verifies that afterwards both repositories have been switched to the correct branch?
Line:5106, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> Why this change? How is this related to the SwitchTo... menu?

Thanks for the review, added the tests and fixed the left-overs.
Line:5106, org.eclipse.egit.ui/plugin.xml -> This change was probably left out from when I was experimenting. Reverted back.
