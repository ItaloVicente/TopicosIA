DESCRIPTION:

History view: shorten view toolbar

Combine the four filter buttons into one single button with a
drop-down menu. Selecting the button itself cycles though the
filters. Use the new FilterAction also in the view menu; to be
able to do so implement ToolBarMenuAction.getMenu(Menu) and rename
the class to DropDownMenuAction.

Also, as long as one only updates the image of an action it isn't
necessary to update the whole toolbar. The framework listens for
such changes and updates the corresponding ToolItem or Menu entry
already.

Now the tooltip is a bit misleading since it shows what you will get when clicking the button, but what is shown at this moment is different. Not sure how to fix this, maybe just show what the current filter shows ?

But that's what the code does, and is what I see.

What I don't like is that it also shows this tooltip when the button is disabled, which is evidently not true.

Showing the current state in the tooltip is a bit strange, too, since most other tooltips tell what's going to happen. Maybe a fixed tooltip for the button "Change the file scope for the history" might be better.

Or maybe a combined tooltip: "Change the file scope for the history. Current: " + tooltip of current action when enabled, just "Change the file scope for the history" when disabled.
