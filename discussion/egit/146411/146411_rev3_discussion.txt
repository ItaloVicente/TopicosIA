DESCRIPTION:

History view: shorten view toolbar

Combine the four filter buttons into one single button with a
drop-down menu. Selecting the button itself cycles though the
filters. Use the new FilterAction also in the view menu; to be
able to do so implement ToolBarMenuAction.getMenu(Menu) and rename
the class to DropDownMenuAction.

Also, as long as one only updates the image of an action it isn't
necessary to update the whole toolbar. The framework listens for
such changes and updates the corresponding ToolItem or Menu entry
already.

I agree, this looks strange 

Looks like the root cause is that the existing icons are not good enough to recognize their meaning without an explaining tooltip.

Which, PS 2 or PS 3? If PS 3, any suggestion (besides "design better icons" -- I have no idea how to improve these icons)?

Perhaps.

I generally like that change as it is. I'm quite certain a huge majority of users never touches those filters, therefore reducing the available space for them is reasonable.

And reducing the history view menu bar width as such also seems a good idea. A co-worker asked me why someone added blank space to the top of either staging or history view recently after an upgrade, and I had to tell him it's just the huge amount of view tabs moving it down. :)
Line:105, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/DropDownMenuAction.java -> should this eventually have the same isEnabled() check as the next method?

Line:379, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/history/GitHistoryPage.java -> is there any reason for calling super first? I thought calling super.dispose last were a common best practice (unless some of the other code in this dispose method requires some fields to be disposed by such a call before).

Is there anything left with this change? I would like to see the functionality merged.

Line:105, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/components/DropDownMenuAction.java -> Actually the isEnabled() in getMenu() is just overly defensive programming and could be removed.

Done.
