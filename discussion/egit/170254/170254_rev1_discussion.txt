DESCRIPTION:

Don't install 3rd party dependency bundles via features

Instead provide them only in the p2 repository. This way they are
available when installing from the jgit p2 repository but we are not
enforcing the version we bring but can also use the version available in
Eclipse if it matches our requirements.

Is this something we need for 5.10? Should these extra bundles even be in a category? Should we even include them, given that the p2 repo has a link to Orbit and p2 should therefore be able to fetch them from there if needed?

I thought this might be useful for installing from a download of the p2 repos zip file on machines which don't have network access.

Not sure if the dependencies should be in a category or not. WDYT ?

Agreed; I forgot about that case.

In Eclipse the dialog for installing will by default not show anything that is not in a category. Of course a user can toggle this and see the bundles anyway. Don't know if not having a category might have side-effects. It was just an idea; it's OK for me if these bundles do have a category.
