DESCRIPTION:

[index diff] Don't wait for the workspace lock

Updating an IndexDiffCacheEntry scheduled jobs that waited for the
workspace lock. This appears to be a remnant of olden times when EGit
used a WorkingTreeIterator that operated on the Eclipse resource tree.
But the ContainerTreeIterator and AdaptableFileTreeIterator were
removed in commit 983c7408 in 2015; since then, EGit operates on files
directly.

Remove waiting for the workspace lock.

I *believe* one nice side effect was that build and egit didn't run in parallel, at least egit waited - and this avoids extra disk IO while build is still running, so build could finish without interruptions.

Whether that's a _nice_ effect is debatable. It means the UI will update only once the build is done. I'm trying to avoid that.

Why should recomputing an index diff in a system job interrupt the build? It doesn't modify the file system, and anyway access the files directly, not through the Eclipse resource tree.

But I'm fully aware that I may not see everything here. This waiting for the workspace lock, later changed to use a scheduling rule encompassing the projects of a repo, is old code.

One possible problem might be builds creating/modifying non-ignored files. But that should cause resource changed events later on, and we'd update the index diff then again.
