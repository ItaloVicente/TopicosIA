Hm... Do you mean some sort of auto-refresh? Registring a Repository Change listener for all displayed Repositories and having (yet another) background job scheduled every 10 seconds (or so) that triggers a scan on all Repositories being displayed?

Well, that would be true if the Repository instances were shared between RCS and Repositories view, but that's not the case (you can have a Repository in the view without having a shared project in the workspace)... I believe it wouldn't work on the instances used by the View without having the scan triggered somehow, am I right?

Having this not integrated with the command line is a good point, but as pointed out by Remy himself, this is a general problem.

No, I meant just attaching RepositoryListeners to the repository instances and wait for them to be fired. There's no need to schedule another detection job when that's what the RCS job is doing.

Would it make sense to use a RepositoryListener to react to changes instead of having the BranchAction force a refresh?

Yes, you're right, that occurred to me in hindsight but I forgot to mention it in my last comment. This is unfortunate but I guess there isn't much we can do about it. At least, not for the immediate future anyway it seems.
