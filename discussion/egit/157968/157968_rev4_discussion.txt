One problem, though: the comparison direction depends on the order the refs appear in the git repositories view. For instance comparing a tag against HEAD I get shown files added since then as removals.

I ran into the same problem with the unified diff, and decided to set it up such that it would always compare the newer commit against the older one, to get "natural" diffs. Maybe we could order the commits by commit time stamp such that things added in the newer commit do show up as additions, not as removals.
