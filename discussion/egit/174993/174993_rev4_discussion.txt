DESCRIPTION:

Bug 536645 - Dont use SWT activation events to enable global actions

This change removes listening to SWT activation events to enable global
actions added via ActionUtils, originally added for bug 536645. Its
possible that FocusTracker view focus handling conflicts with this event
handling. In particular an activation event can be sent for one widget,
followed by a focus gained event for another widget, without
deactivation/focus lost events in-between (those events are sent
afterwards). This results in other handler conflicts.

The change leaves SWT deactivation event handling, since that still
fixes the original problem reported in bug 536645: an SWT deactivation
event can come "on time" to prevent some handler conflicts.

LGTM. Cannot produce handler conflicts on Mac. The change also seems to make sense; the original intent was to have the actions installed when the control has the focus, not when it was activated. If additionally also removing the actions on deactivation helps because some FocusOut events arrive late then that's fine by me.

Feel free to merge. (Unless you should have noticed regressions on Windows, but I don't suppose so.)
