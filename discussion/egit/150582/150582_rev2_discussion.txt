DESCRIPTION:

Add hide repository group functionality

Repository groups can be marked as hideable via context menu.
The repositories view filter has an additional option for hiding groups
marked as hideable. If the filter is not activated the sorting places
all hideable repository groups behind all unhideable ones.

Patch set 2 makes the changes compatible to the latest version of the underlying repository groups change. I tried to address issues similar to those commented on there.

It works, but I find it confusing. The hide/unhide menu items only mark the group as hideable. Actual visibility is then defined by the filter. If I have hidden some groups and then want to make one of them visible again, I have to change the filter to show them all, unhide one, then activate the filter again.

I'm not opposed to such a feature, but if we do it, then I believe we should go in the way the package or project explorer treat WorkingSets. There's an explicit "Configure Working Sets" dialog, where I see them all, can check which ones I want to see, and where I can create and remove WorkingSets. (I can even define the order, either manually or let Eclipse sort them.)

Since repo groups are conceptually very much like WorkingSets I think the UI for managing them should be similar.

P.S.: note that the package explorer has no _filter_ for WorkingSets.

I agree with what you said. I was looking for a least effort way for making certain groups invisible. Another idea was having something like a ".*"-resources filter and hiding groups if their names start with dot. But these are all hacks.
The problem is that the more repository group behave like working sets the harder it is to justify not actually using working sets...

My suggestion would be to just leave the hiding feature.

:-) I had at the very beginning briefly looked at WorkingSets, but I have never used them, and I had the impression they would automatically appear in the package/project explorer's list of working sets, which we definitely don't want. Maybe my first quick impression was wrong, though.

At least in this form. We do addition/deletion/creation etc. a bit different from the way the package explorer handles workings sets (and I think it's OK; our way is just as good), but a simple dialog showing all repo groups in a checkbox tree where the user can select the ones he'd like to see might be a good idea.

Though frankly said, I don't know if it's really necessary. Even with the ~40 repos (lots of test repos) I have in the repo view of my development eclipse, I think I'd use maybe 3 top-level repos and 3-4 groups. Personally I have no need to completely hide some of these few groups.

If you feel it's useful and want to implement something simple, go ahead, and if not, it's also fine.

A hide repository functionality can be added later depending.
