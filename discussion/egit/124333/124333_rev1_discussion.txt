It's been a long time since I tried this last time.

I tried to use this, but I am struggling how to enable LFS.

I started from a clean ~/.gitconfig having no LFS related configuration.

* The button to enable LFS under "Preferences > Team > Git >Enable LFS support globally (for the current user)"
is disabled and the title of this option says "LFS support (not installed)" though I have installed the org.eclipse.jgit.lfs bundle.
* I cannot find any command in the repository context menu (in repositories view) which allows to enable LFS for a repository.
* Switching on the option "Preferences > Team > Git > Confirmations > Automatically configure LFS without confirmation" also doesn't seem to make any difference.

Could you add some documentation how to use this built-in LFS integration to the user guide [1] ?

Should be perfectly fine, yes.

I can reproduce although I don't understand. Likely something has changed in the meantime which did not cause a conflict but malfunction.

It seems that the LFS bundle is somehow not detected, so this menu is missing as well.

I think this is all related to the same issue.

Once it's working and we merged (or are planning to merge) the change - yes, of course.
