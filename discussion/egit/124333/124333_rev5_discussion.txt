DESCRIPTION:

EGit integration for LFS

* Register builtin LFS on startup
  When EGit starts and the lfs bundle (org.eclipse.jgit.lfs) is
  available register the LFS implementation and check configuration.
* Allow install (enablement) of LFS support in Preferences (global) and
  on the repository (local).
* Apply smudge/clean filters where applicable and required.
* LFS integration using built-in JGit lfs filters fully works when using
  Gerrit with lfs plugin using ssh protocol.
* Pushing lfs objects over http still fails with 401 response code,
  this is tracked in JGit bug 535814

@Markus: 
can you please document how to use this in the EGit User Guide ?
Ensure to mention that it works with ssh but there is still some work to do for http/https.

Let me know if you can finish that today then we can include this documentation in 5.0.

I can certainly document that, yes. Where in this large'ish page should that topic go best?

I will almost certainly not be able to finish it today, but I can try to at least add basic information to the page.

I have added something here: https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#GIT_LFS_Support

Its quite basic, you may have to move it to the correct place on the page :) need to leave for today, adaptions if required tomorrow - just tell me :)

Line:1113, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CompareUtils.java -> How does this interact with the clean filter and CR-LF translations being applied in setIndexEntryContents() above?

Line:1113, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CompareUtils.java -> I will test whether it works still without this. With the change everything is working, but you're right, maybe we're filtering twice, where the second time would not find anything to do though (it detects that very quickly) :)

There are not many tests (yet :)) There are tests in jgit.lfs.server.test which test the basic logic, but nothing (apart from (excessive) manual tests) until now which tests the /integration/ of this logic.
Line:1113, org.eclipse.egit.ui/src/org/eclipse/egit/ui/internal/CompareUtils.java -> I tested and everything works as expected (although slow) without this change, since you implemented this differently in the meantime :)... I reverted it.

Slower than _with_ the change? (IIRC correctly, this code here would be used on an index edit.)

Anyway, there are various places where the whole blob is read into memory. For instance, here we have it fully in memory, or also in GitDocument. I don't think this will really work with truly large files (which is what LFS is for, after all).

And yes, for at least most LFS files this does not make too much sense/difference anyway. It's just us here managing large .sql/.ddl files with LFS :D they are plain text and diffs do help, as well as index editing support. I verified that it works with the changes you did, so it's save to remove this :)
