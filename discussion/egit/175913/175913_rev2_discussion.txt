DESCRIPTION:

Use an OSGi declarative service to manage some EGit components

Add a StartEventListener OSGi declarative service to start things
that require the workbench to have been created. If the workbench
is already running when the service is activated, it initializes
the EGit components right away. Otherwise, the handler is notified
on the APP_STARTUP_COMPLETED event and initializes the EGit components
then.

This change uses this mechanism for the SelectionRepositoryStateCache
only, but it might be used to manage other EGit internal components
in the future.

Maybe some parts of EGit might themselves become OSGi declarative
services and deal with their own activation as they need. The single
StartEventHandler is a useful bridge facilitating the move to OSGi
declarative services while minimizing code changes, though.

Patch Set 2:

I think the idea of moving the startup code in the Activator into a DS which then listens out for the startup event is a good idea.

The question I have is if any code subsequent to the activator relies on this code having been executed? If so it might need to go in there as well.

I've been looking to see about moving some of the Jobs that get started into DS components as well but I've been delayed in writing it up.

So I think this approach looks good :)

I think this is good to go as is.

I think we can investigate moving other componentns to this at a later stage; for example, the FocusListener depends on the Workbench (and we have a remove in the shutdown of the bundle) which could be handled by this component listening out for the IWorkbench arriving and setting a focus listener, and similarly for removal -- but those could be additional changes after this one.
