DESCRIPTION:

[428752]  Problem with completion when case is not respected
COMMIT 1/2 (generated source code follows)

FIX:
the content proposal adapter is switched to
ContentProposalAdapter.PROPOSAL_REPLACE This allows to replace the full
content of the expression allowing to change bad case, written by user,
by the good one proposed in autocompletion.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> - Just add "(1/2)" at the end of the first line if really needed (I'm not sure it is).
- It's usually better to have the first line worded as (i) an action, (ii) which describes the change instead of the problem. Something like "Fix proposal insertion when case is not respected".
- Don't reuse the bug's title for the commit messages. They are often very vague (being reported by users we don't know the internal workings), sometimes wrong, and very rarely actually describe what the commit *does* (which should be the point of the commit message).
- Following from the previous point, if the fix for an issue requires multiple commits (the more general case), each commit should have a title which describes the step performed by that commit. Otherwise we get a list of commits with the same title (hard to distinguish).

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> No need for "FIX".
