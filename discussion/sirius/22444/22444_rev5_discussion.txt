DESCRIPTION:

[428756] Improve tree refresh algorithm

We have performance issue on tree editor in manual refresh.
We have performance issue on 2 cases :

1. On expand, because in DTreeViewerListener we execute a
TreeFoldingRecordingCommand which refresh all the subtree of the
expanded DTreeItem even for DTreeItem contained in a collapsed
DTreeItem. In addition if we are in auto refresh or in manual, we expand
or collapse, we call RefreshTreeElementTask which refresh the expanded
DTreeItem, which is not done by the TreeFoldingRecordingCommand which
refresh only the subtree. RefreshTreeElementTask also refresh the style
of all expanded sub tree item in case of expanded DTreeItem, and refresh
all the DTree in case of expand of DTree.

Note that RefreshTreeElementTask which is executed in a SiriusCommand
execute RefreshRepresentationsCommand/RefreshTreeElementCommand in a
CommandStack which makes no sense.

2. On item creation, as for expand DTreeRefresh refresh all the subtree
even for DTreeItem contained in a collapsed DTreeItem.
I will submit a first release of patch to gerrit to improve refresh
performance.
3 changes in the patch:
1. org.eclipse.sirius.synchronizer.CreatedOutput.synchronizeChildren()
method added to know if we must refresh the subtree of a
DTreeItemContainer, this allow to do lazy refresh for collapsed
DTreeItem. But to have DTreeContentProvider.hasChildren() return true
for container having children not yet created, we create a single not
refreshed children.
2. TreeItemContainerChildSupport.reorderChilds() changed to not call
ECollections.sort() when there is only one mapping in place.
3. DTreeViewerListener.treeExpanded() changed to not use
RefreshTreeElementTask when we are in auto-refresh.

To leave the opportunity to do a full refresh without lazy we add a
boolean to the sirius refresh api to allow to do it.
