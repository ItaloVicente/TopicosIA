DESCRIPTION:

[428756] Improve tree refresh algorithm

We have performance issue on tree editor in manual refresh.
We have performance issue on 2 cases :

1. On expand, because in DTreeViewerListener we execute a
TreeFoldingRecordingCommand which refreshes all the subtrees of the
expanded DTreeItem even for DTreeItem contained in a collapsed
DTreeItem.
In addition if we are in auto refresh or in manual, when the tree is
expanded or collapsed, we call always RefreshTreeElementTask which
refreshes the expanded
DTreeItem, this is not done by the TreeFoldingRecordingCommand which
refreshes only the subtree. RefreshTreeElementTask also refreshes the
style
of all expanded sub trees items in case of expanded DTreeItem, and
refreshes
all the DTree in case of expand of DTree.

Note that RefreshTreeElementTask which is executed in a SiriusCommand
executes RefreshRepresentationsCommand/RefreshTreeElementCommand in a
CommandStack which makes no sense.

2. On item creation, as for TreeItem expansion, DTreeRefresh refresh all
the subtree
even for DTreeItem contained in a collapsed DTreeItem.

3 changes in the patch:
1. org.eclipse.sirius.synchronizer.CreatedOutput.synchronizeChildren()
method added to know if we must refresh the subtree of a
DTreeItemContainer, this allows to do lazy refresh for collapsed
DTreeItem. But to have DTreeContentProvider.hasChildren() returning true
for container having children not yet created, we create only one
children, without refreshing it as it will be refreshed when user will
expand the DTreeContainer containing it.
2. TreeItemContainerChildSupport.reorderChilds() changed to not call
ECollections.sort() when there is only one mapping in place.
3. DTreeViewerListener.treeExpanded() changed to not use
RefreshTreeElementTask when we are in auto-refresh.

To leave the opportunity to do a full refresh without lazy we add a
boolean to the Sirius refresh api to allow to do it.

+1 for me.

-1 for the API change in DialectServices. If the tree dialect has a need for a specialized partial refresh, fine, but it can be implemented by a method which exists only in TreeDialectServices, whitout exposing this to all other dialects. As it is, the other dialects declare implementing a method which supports partial refresh, but behave the same way whatever the value of the flag is.

It seems the core of the patch improves the performances a lot, so I'm not saying -1 for the change itself, just for the fact that this changes core Sirius APIs. If support for such partial refresh proves usefull and can be generalized in some way, then we can think about exposing this in the APIs, but for now it is premature.

Patch Set 14:

A boolean has been added in API to be able to do full refresh not to do lazy, as this last is the default value.
We need to do full refresh because we have external tools which analyse these fulled refreshed representations to display them in Dynamic HTML.

TreeDialectServices is not in API then cannot be used. In future, we could have a full refresh for table dialect which can have sub lines not created according to semantic. Same for diagram dialect, for which we could have all views created and not visible even for not activated layers.

I see, then OK for the API change. I still have one issue, about the naming and documentation of the new flag:
* "Lazy" does not convey the right meaning. Laziness is about transparently deferring work until client code actually needs the result. Here this is more about the scope of the refresh (not about the time the work will get done).
* The Javadoc for DialectSevices.refresh() (old version witout the flag) now says "By default a lazy refresh is done", which is not true, as this notion of lazy/partial refresh is not implemented in diagrams and trees.

For the JavaDoc, the documentation for the new flag should make it clear that "partial" refresh is an optional feature, that may or may not be implemented by all dialects. I propose something like:

@param fullRefresh
    if true, all the representation elements are refreshed (or created/removed as needed), including elements which may not be visible to the user. If false, the implementation is allowed (but not required) not to refresh some representation elements if it can determine that the user can not see them and interact with them.
