DESCRIPTION:

[428756] Improve tree refresh algorithm

We have performance issue on tree editor in manual refresh.
We have performance issue on 2 cases :

1. On expand, because in DTreeViewerListener we execute a
TreeFoldingRecordingCommand which refreshes all the subtrees of the
expanded DTreeItem even for DTreeItem contained in a collapsed
DTreeItem.
In addition if we are in auto refresh or in manual, when the tree is
expanded or collapsed, we call always RefreshTreeElementTask which
refreshes the expanded
DTreeItem, this is not done by the TreeFoldingRecordingCommand which
refreshes only the subtree. RefreshTreeElementTask also refreshes the
style
of all expanded sub trees items in case of expanded DTreeItem, and
refreshes
all the DTree in case of expand of DTree.

Note that RefreshTreeElementTask which is executed in a SiriusCommand
executes RefreshRepresentationsCommand/RefreshTreeElementCommand in a
CommandStack which makes no sense.

2. On item creation, as for TreeItem expansion, DTreeRefresh refresh all
the subtree
even for DTreeItem contained in a collapsed DTreeItem.

3 changes in the patch:
1. org.eclipse.sirius.synchronizer.CreatedOutput.synchronizeChildren()
method added to know if we must refresh the subtree of a
DTreeItemContainer, this allows to do lazy refresh for collapsed
DTreeItem. But to have DTreeContentProvider.hasChildren() returning true
for container having children not yet created, we create only one
children, without refreshing it as it will be refreshed when user will
expand the DTreeContainer containing it.
2. TreeItemContainerChildSupport.reorderChilds() changed to not call
ECollections.sort() when there is only one mapping in place.
3. DTreeViewerListener.treeExpanded() changed to not use
RefreshTreeElementTask when we are in auto-refresh.

To leave the opportunity to do a full refresh without lazy we add a
boolean to the Sirius refresh api to allow to do it.

A use case (and steps to reproduce) that highlights the performance problem must be added in the bugzilla, at least to check the improvement manually.

The problem of refresh algorithm is exactly the same for table. No?

Line:65, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/ui/tools/internal/editor/listeners/DTreeViewerListener.java -> Here there is an access to preferenceStore at each expand. This is not efficient (or at least it could be better). I think Pierre-Charles recently observed this problem elsewhere (see him for more detail).

The lines

final SiriusCommand result = new SiriusCommand(domain);

and

expandDTreeItemCmd.append(result);

should be in the new "if" too.

Line:90, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/ui/tools/internal/editor/provider/DTreeContentProvider.java -> Why change the code of hasChildren? It must be linked to the code of getChildren. If the code of getChildren changes, the new code of hasChildren becomes wrong.

Line:77, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/api/interaction/DTreeUserInteraction.java -> "@return this user interaction" --> @return this user interaction for convenience

Line:364, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/dialect/common/tree/DTreeRefresh.java -> What is the impact of this change?

Line:134, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/dialect/DialectServices.java -> 2 points here

Line:45, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/dialect/command/RefreshRepresentationsCommand.java -> doFullRefresh twice

"all view model elements are created" --> all view model elements are created and refreshed

Line:102, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/dialect/DialectManagerImpl.java -> Why false is the default value ?
If I launch a refresh without specify anything it seems more natural to refresh all.

Idem for all methods as this one

Line:247, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.table/src/org/eclipse/sirius/table/business/internal/dialect/TableDialectServices.java -> This can be the case as line in table can have sub lines but which are expanded by default.
For diargam this could also be the case, for example in a full refresh we could have DDiagramElement and GMF View created even for not enabled layers, in this case they would be created by with visible at false.

Line:90, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/ui/tools/internal/editor/provider/DTreeContentProvider.java -> It is more effecient to call "List.isEmpty()" than "getChildren().length>0" especially when the list is big.

Line:364, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/dialect/common/tree/DTreeRefresh.java -> Before there was a buggy lazy refresh working from the 2nd level of imbrication. Now this is managed with CreatedOutput.synchronizeChildren() method.

Line:102, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/dialect/DialectManagerImpl.java -> At use, i.e. in a editor, we want to have refresh efficient then lazy. We want to do a full refresh only when exported representation model to another model, in our use case we want export DTree model to a HTML/Javascript expandable tree then we needs all DTreeItems be created.
