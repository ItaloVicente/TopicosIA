DESCRIPTION:

[568037] Arrange selection with ELK layout

* A new field has been added in CustomLayoutAlgorithm to allow to use or
not the standard ArrangeSelection mechanism (see javadoc of
ArrangeSelectionLayoutProvider). It was always used by default but for
ELK we want a different behavior. This field is associated with
corresponding methods in CustomLayoutAlgorithmBuilder.
* In GenericLayoutProvider, we consider this new field to launch ELK
layout without the standard ArrangeSelection mechanism.
* In case of ArrangeSelection, in
org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.elk.GmfLayoutEditPolicy.getCommand(Request),
the root element was not retrieved (because the first element was the
root).
* ELKLayoutNodeProvider no longer implements ExtendableLayoutProvider.
This was added for bug 540987 [1] (commit 066b0d28 [2]). But this
bugzilla has been reopened because of problem.
* ElkDiagramLayoutConnector did not handle the case where the root is no
a diagram since this commit 35201b83 [3] for bug 538373 [4]. This commit
partially reverts this modification to set back this ability.
* Only TopGraphicEditPart are now considered for method
ElkDiagramLayoutConnector.commonParent. This avoids to have intermediate
AbstractDNode*CompartmentEditPart as parent.
* During an arrange all, the origin location is now the same as "Reset
origin" action.
