DESCRIPTION:

[460947] Utilities to support invocation of Java from the workspace

Introduce utility classes and APIs abstracting ClassLoading capabilities
used by query interpreters.

An Interpreter registers callbacks on an instance of JavaExtensionsManager.
These callbacks will be triggered when a class has been loaded, unloaded, not
found or gone missing.
The JavaExtensionsManager update maintain its state in sync with the
current list of imports, the scope (projects, plugins) and the workspace
notifications.
By using the same mechanisms, the JavaExtensionsManager computes and
maintain the list of EPackages declarations which are visibles in the
current classpath.

The JavaExtensionsManager is designed in a way which makes an instance
shareable among different interpreters if one wants to avoid the cost of
search/loading several times for the same class.

It rely on a ClassLoading implementation (BundleClassLoading by default)
which search for classes in the current Bundles. This implementation is overriden
by WorkspaceClassLoading when the org.eclipse.sirius.editor plugin is installed. This
implementation also searches in workspace classes and use the PDE to
detect dependencies.
