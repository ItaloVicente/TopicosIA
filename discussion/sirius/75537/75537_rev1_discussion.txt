DESCRIPTION:

[495119] Fix pb of collapsing last region in horizontal stack

Since previous commit for bug 495119 (Compute GMF regions size according
to container size), there is a regression on collapsing the last region
in horizontal stack (a blank space remains if the regions container is
not in auto-size).

In AirXYLayoutEditPolicy [1], the constraint of a regions container is
force to "-1" for height (see commit 77d6b284 and method
getConstraintFor). This is for facility reason to handle the case when
the label is hide/show. This "-1" explains the difference between HStack
and VStack when collapsing the last region. For the same facility
reason, the width is also constraint to "-1" here. A clean way would be
to set this "-1" directly during the resize command.

Line:307, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/AirXYLayoutEditPolicy.java -> We check that the added child is a RegionContainer.

Line:310, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/AirXYLayoutEditPolicy.java -> Should not we check the direction of the stack and set the dimension to -1 regarding this direction: 
  - setHeight(-1) for VStack
  - setWidth(-1) for HStack 
?

Line:307, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/AirXYLayoutEditPolicy.java -> I'm not sure about your remarks. The code was already there.

Line:310, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/AirXYLayoutEditPolicy.java -> No, as the initial commit where this code was introduced, and as explained in the comment of this commit, this code is a ease.
I think that the correct location for this kind of code should be in the resize policy. I will create an issue for this "cleanup".
