DESCRIPTION:

[481846] Prevent newer Sirius model loading to avoid potential issues

 - We detect only the cases where a VSM or Representations resource has
version higher that the newest migration participant.
 - For Representations resource, we offer also feedback to end-user
about this issue and the choice to open session despite version
mismatch. This feedback is provided through a
UICallback.askSessionReopeningWithResourceVersionMismatch()
implementation which is replaceable.
 - For VSM resource version mismatch, we prevent the viewpoint to be
register in the ViewpointRegistry(A message is added in the log) and we
close the session when trying to open it.
 - When opening the VSM in its editor, natively, the odesign editor
displays the errors in the problems thumbnail.
 - As the code getting and opening the session is mutualized for export
and aird open, the monitor work dividing up is defined once (30% for
getting session and 70% for opening session)
 - Tests are added to check VSM and aird version mismatch.
 
 - An exception thrown in the resource loading has been a lead but is
not a solution. Consider the case when the resource is loaded because of
proxy resolution. In that cases, the exception is silently catched by
ECoreUtil.resolve. It is the case for referenced analysis and for the
viewpoint referenced by the View.

Line:20, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.textile -> "were defined with a more recent version of Sirius than the one you are using"

Line:20, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.textile -> "which was saved using a more recent version of Sirius than the one you are using"

Line:20, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.textile -> This sounds like a literal translation of "malgré tout", but does sound right in english. I suggest "anyway" instead. I think we should make it clear here that this is a *bad idea* to do this, and we do not guarantee anything if the user chooses to proceed.

"Warning: if you choose to proceed, there is no guarantee that the resulting session will be usable. It may even lead to data loss or corruption; use at your own risk."

Line:136, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit.support/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/support/api/SiriusTestCase.java -> Formatting bug.

Line:178, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/api/session/ResourceVersionMismatchTest.java -> You can put
  RuntimeException.class.getName(), "VSM"
directly here, no need for an intermediate variable.

Line:53, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/plugin.properties -> No space here in english.

Line:85, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/session/SessionUIManager.java -> SessionUIManager is for "UI session", which is maybe badly named, but solely for tracking which editors correspond to which actual session. It is *not* the main API to open Sirius Sessions, and must not be:
- we are in the UI plug-in here, and we want the core of Sirius to work without a UI;
- all existing client code for *years* have been using the non-UI SessionFactory.createSession() or something that calls it. If the new "version check" behavior is only performed when using a completely new API, no existing client (incl. existing UI code from other products) will benefit from it).

Line:371, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/api/command/AbstractSWTCallback.java -> Why introduce a separate class for such a simple use case? It's just "return MessageDiaglog.openQuestion()" with appropriate parameters.

Line:91, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/actions/export/ExportRepresentationsFromFileAction.java -> This should not use SessionUIManager.

Line:74, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/actions/repair/RepresentationFilesRepairAction.java -> This code should be factored somewhere instead of duplicated.

Line:143, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/OpenRepresentationsFileJob.java -> Should not use SessionUIManager.

Line:147, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/OpenRepresentationsFileJob.java -> Remove if not needed.

Line:469, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/provider/Messages.java -> Was this moved because it was not it was not correctly sorted before? Because it is not here either :-)

Line:86, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/plugin.properties -> "can not" (avoid contractions in formal communication.

Line:86, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/plugin.properties -> No need for additional spaces here.

Line:86, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/plugin.properties -> No space here in english.

Line:124, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/plugin.properties -> "can not" (avoid contractions in formal communication.

Line:124, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/plugin.properties -> No need for additional spaces here.

Line:124, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/plugin.properties -> No space here in english.

Line:123, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/util/DescriptionResourceImpl.java -> Strange to use an XMIException here, which would imply something is corrupted at the XMI level, which is not the case. Especially since there is a AirdResourceVersionMismatchException defined in the same patch which implements Resource.Diagnostic.

Line:122, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/componentization/ViewpointRegistryImpl.java -> Not needed, there is no string literal here.

Line:58, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/resource/MigrationUtil.java -> This is ugly :-( I don't have a better proposition right now, but it's still ugly...

Line:1205, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DAnalysisSessionImpl.java -> Why testing only the ones activated on session opening? What happens if there is an issue with one of the Viewpoint which is referenced but not active at this point, and the user activates it later?

Line:1222, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DAnalysisSessionImpl.java -> This is dangerous, "instanceof RuntimeException" is a very general test. What if a semantic resource's implementation has loading errors which are "instanceof RuntimeException" but have nothing to do with what we are trying to detect here?
