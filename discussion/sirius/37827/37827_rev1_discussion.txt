DESCRIPTION:

[454014] Forbid centered edge end moving on rectilinear edge

* In case of a rectilinear edge with only two bendpoints, if one of its
end was centered, the user was able to move the other end but that
causes the entire segment moving. If one of the edge end is centered, we
now forbid to move all ends for rectilinear edges with only one segment.
* This commit fixes the comment 1 [1]
* This commit includes additional tests to check this behavior.
