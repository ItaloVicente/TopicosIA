DESCRIPTION:

[433966] Support dynamic EPackage

Avoid a PackageNotFoundException on dynamic model addition on a
representations resource :
1. To avoid doing changes in the singleton Registry, we set a
PackageRegistry local to the ResourceSet, i.e.
ResourceSet.setPackageRegistry().
2. In case a ResourceSet has provided its own PackageRegistry, we use a
delegate, i.e. DelegatePackageRegistry, to delegate to an existing
PackageRegistry's ResourceSet

Note that I have only reviewed the impementation for DelegatePackageRegistry. I have not looked at whether or not this is the right approach to solve the underlying issue of dynamic EPackages. Esteban: we probably need to discuss this together.
Line:3, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ext.emf/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ext/emf/DelegatePackageRegistry.java -> EPL license text missing. And this is probably © Obeo.

Line:28, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ext.emf/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ext/emf/DelegatePackageRegistry.java -> The name is slightly confusing, because from the code, the primary state of this class is "defaultPackageRegistry" and the secondary one is named "delegatePackageRegistry", like the class itself.

I would propose "DelegatingPackageRegistry" for the class (because it is not itself a delegate, but delegating is what it does), and maybe "localPackageRegistry" instead of default.

Line:77, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ext.emf/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ext/emf/DelegatePackageRegistry.java -> This looks wrong. If the delegate has a package P1 registered at the URI U, and the default/local overrides/shadows this with a different package P2 for the same URI U, the entry for <U, P1> should not be visible. In such a state, this.get(U) would return P2, and only P2, so it seems inconsistent for entrySet() to return both <U, P1> and <U, P2>.

Line:124, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ext.emf/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ext/emf/DelegatePackageRegistry.java -> Same remark as for entrySet(): this is counting twice the entries which are shadowed by local overrides.

Line:131, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ext.emf/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ext/emf/DelegatePackageRegistry.java -> Same remark as for entrySet() and size(): this returns values which are in the delegate but should not be visible because they are shadowed locally.
