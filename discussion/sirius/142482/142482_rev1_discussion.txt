DESCRIPTION:

[546681] Use a more reliable way to close/hide the outline view

When the outline view is not already open/visible, the previous
technique causes a timeout and test failure. If a previous test in the
suite had already closed the view and failed to restore it (maybe
because itself failed for some other reason), this could cause long
sequences of test failures until another test explictly restored the
normal state.
