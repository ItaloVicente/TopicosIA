DESCRIPTION:

* In the case where the aird or odesign has been replaced by a version
that needs to be migrated (the previous one was up-to-date) the
migration was not launched.
* In the other case where the the resource is reloaded and doesn't need
to be migrate any more, the migration was still launched.
