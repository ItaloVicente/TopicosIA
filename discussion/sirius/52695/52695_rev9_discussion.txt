One significant change (regression even if confirmed) in behavior with this is that previously, the check on navigation tool (precondition & co) was made on each refresh() of the decorator edit part. With this patch, it will only be done when a representation is created or removed. If a semantic change makes the condition change, the decorator will not be updated.

Example (not tested): I have a diagram D1 with semantic element A visible on it. I create a new diagram D2 on B, which is navigable from A, but only if B has some property, which it has not at this point (for the sake of the example, "A can navigate to B only if B contains at least one C"). At this point we don't create a decorator for A. Go on B, create some Cs. Go back to A: no representation has been created, so we do not refresh the decorator, and I still can't navigate from A to B.

This is all hypothetical, from my understanding of the code just reading it. I may be wrong. If I'm not, we can't have this regression.
Line:103, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/providers/decorators/RelatedDRepresentationDecorator.java -> I'm really not a fan of having yet another peripheral class which installs low-level listeners, but until SessionListener is refactored to be actually useful, I don't have better to propose.

Line:126, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/providers/decorators/RelatedDRepresentationDecorator.java -> This is (relatively) costly, and could be moved out of the for loop.

Line:159, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/providers/decorators/RelatedDRepresentationDecorator.java -> return precondition && checkRepresentation*

Line:126, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/providers/decorators/RelatedDRepresentationDecorator.java -> Done

Line:159, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/providers/decorators/RelatedDRepresentationDecorator.java -> As it is in a loop, I must iterate until a condition is at true, otherwise I return false at the end of the loop.
