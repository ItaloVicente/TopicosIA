Ole, after all it was my own mistake ^^. I also reverted the changes I made to the failing test class (even if I think they do more good than harm).

I wrote about this in the bugzilla. For us it's not really necessary, since one can always create a new note and delete the old one.. but if you think it should be possible, then I need to know you'd want it: Property view or context menu action.

Hello Felix, sorry for the late answer.

Concerning the edition of the targeted diagram, in my opinion it would be nice to have it in the property view. I will show it to the team to gather some feedback.

For the Navigation task, I just tried in order to be sure. It does not closes the diagram (well it close it if the task creates the diagram of course), however it does not clear the stack trace. I will ask the team if I am not making too big a deal of this...

Hello Steve,

The Property view for the classic note elements contains a tab called "Appearance" which is empty. Thus in order to stay consistent with the classical notes, it would be logical not to add any property view for this new kind of note.
Moreover, the new notes are fully operational without it (you only have to delete the existing note and recreate one refering to another diagram).

Hello,

Indeed, I forgot that we can't edit a note from the property view. However, we can still edit them on the diagram (F2 or two slow clicks). In our opinion, it should still be editable one way or another, with a contextual menu or with a "..." button after the link.

Concerning the command undo/redo, the team have the same opinion, it should not be disable and have the same user experience as a double click tool with a navigation task or just the contextual action Navigate.

I noticed that on the dialog that allows to select which representation to link, the current representation is available. Shouldn't it be filtered out?

I also have two topics with a lower priority:
- I previously noted that the there was no border and no folded corner on the link-note, like on a note. The folded corner could be replaced by an icon showing that it is a linked note. Also, I checked the specification and we also forcasted to have two new preferences in the page Sirius>Sirius Diagram>Appearance to let the user choose the fill and border color (like Note fill color and Note linke color).
- currently the link note display the targeted representation name and then the message. This prevent having a link note with the diagram name in the middle of a sentence. For instance "This is a link note referencing 'my other awesome diagram'".

Regards,
Steve

A context menu would be easier for me.

Ok, I'll copy this behavior.

 Maybe, but I thought it might be useful if one wants to add the name of the current diagram in a corner, like it's known from UML diagrams.

Uhm, ok, I'll see how this works.

 No, it's two 'sub' edit parts, one header which is the link and one note text below. I have no idea how one could mix these two.

Ok for having a contextual menu.

Yeah the last point would be a nice to have but might be overkill
