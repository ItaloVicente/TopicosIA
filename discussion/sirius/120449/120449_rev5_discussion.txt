Is the failing test a bit fragile? I have no idea why this patch would cause a failure here..

We certainly have some fragile tests, but LockedModelExplorerTest.testRefreshJobForModelExplorerView seems to fail systematically on this patch, and I don't see it failing recently on other unrelated patches. The only thing I see in your changes that could be related (but I've not read the patch) is that you modified SiriusCommonContentProvider, which is used in the Model Explorer view that the test exercises.

That class was modified in the first patchset, after which the test didn't fail. It only failed from patch 3 on :/. I'm not 100% sure, but could it be that the test code is broken: The flag that is used to check if a refresh was triggered is not synchronized, so there are visibility problems if the value is being accessed from different threads. On my rig the test passes, but I only run it isolated. I'll add some temporary debug output and submit as a new patchset to see what's going on in the build server.

Also, this line here :
  refreshJobScheduled = event.getJob().belongsTo(RefreshLabelImageJob.FAMILY);
will clear the flag when ANY other job is scheduled in the meantime

This appears to flush the command stack. If I rename an element, then double click on the link note to open a diagram. I can't close the diagram by ctrl+Z, but more inconvenient I can't undo the element renaming.

I was expecting to have the same border and folded top right corner but with the name of the linked diagram in blue (like a hypertext).

Line:87, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/OpenDRepresentationEditPolicy.java -> Yes that's not perfect. I'm not sure why this must be a command at all.. As a user I wouldn't expect to have an "Undo open representation". Maybe there's a trick so we can open the editor without the command stack knowing anything about it? I will look.

Line:95, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/view/factories/SiriusNoteViewFactory.java -> No specific reason, this is just the default GMF runtime which adapts the note style if a diagramlink annotation is found on the view. We can change this, but I'm not sure if a hyperlink label is good, since that would suggest I can single-click it to open the editor.

Also do you plan to add a way to edit the targeted representation in the link note? I have not found a way to edit it.
Line:87, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/OpenDRepresentationEditPolicy.java -> As the command is return by the edit policy I do not know if there is a trick to execute it "silently" or on a different command stack.
Note that the NavigateToCommand (I think you can reuse it istead of adding OpenSiriusDiagramCommand here) used by the Navigation task opening a representation does not turn off undo/redo. I think we may want to have the same behavior when opening a representation from the "link note" or a double click tool + navigation task.

Line:87, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/OpenDRepresentationEditPolicy.java -> So if I "Navigate to..", I can actually "undo" the navigate? Interesting. If that's the case, sure, I can reuse this behavior for the double click.
