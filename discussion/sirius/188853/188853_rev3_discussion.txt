DESCRIPTION:

[573405] Make same size operational on regions container

This commit fixes and improve support of "make
same size" action applied on regions container:
* Action is now supported when regions container is used as source or as
target.
* Action is now supported when the selection contains both regions
containers and standard containers.
* For the already supported case, the regions container was not set as
auto-size, with {-1;-1}. The display size, draw2d size, is computed
later according to regions size.

The code coverage of SizeBothAction is 99% with the tests
CompartmentsSizeTest (updated in previous commits)

No change on documentation, it is already OK (see "Make Same Size" in
https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/user/diagrams/Diagrams.html#ref_tabbar_element).

I have to admit I do not have enough in depth knowledge of this part. I would need to take some time in debug mode to really properly judge. It looks good to me, but I also trust you on this one :)
