DESCRIPTION:

[DRAFT 432400] Remove DRefreshable.refresh()

Remove the refresh() EOperation from the metamodel, and either remove or move the manual
code that existed in the various implementations. The DRefreshable type itself, which is
empty after this change and thus becomes just a "marker interface", will be removed in a
second step.

DRefreshable.refresh() was implemented by: DRepresentation, DView, DRepresentationElement,
and Style. Each case is treated separately.

For concrete DRepresentations (e.g. DDiagramSpec, DTableSpec, etc.), all the
implementations where exactly the same and delegated to DialectManager.refresh(), so all
call sites which target DRepresentations now simply call that directly.

For DView, the only call that can end up in DViewSpec.refresh() is in
DeleteSemanticElementTest.testSemanticElementDeletionRemovesDiagram(). DViewSpec.refresh()
does some actual work, so just to be safe for now, the code has been kept but moved in a
new internal DViewHelper (outside of the metamodel's code) and called explicitly from the
test.

For DRepresentationElement and Style, although these types are shared by all dialects, the
only concrete implementations and the only uses of the operation are in diagrams, and even
more precisely the only mechanism through which the operation is called is
oes.diagram.tools.api.command.view.RefreshSiriusElement. All the concrete implementations
have been moved into an internal switch-based helper inside RefreshSiriusElement.

After the move, this leaves a number of *Spec classes empty (they only existed to override
refresh()), so these are removed completely.
