DESCRIPTION:

[453061] Fix original Draw2D bendpoint copy

The Draw2D bendpoints original locations were saved by copying a list.
Therefore, the list elements could be changed during the feedback. This
lead to a wrong restoration of the edge if a reconnection failed
(reconnected to a non candidate target). Note that this issue was
visible only if the GMF coordinates were broken, because Draw2D has to
compute coordinates.

Cloned from bug: 445179
