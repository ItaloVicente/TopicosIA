DESCRIPTION:

[build] Remove all Juno-based target platforms

Capella, our last major user who was still using Juno, will move to a
Mars target platform for their next major release. Remove support for
Juno to avoid too wide a range: Juno, Kepler, Luna, Mars and Neon would
be a little too much to handle for 4.0.

I've left Kepler for now, but it might be removed too at some point
before Sirius 4.0 if we can get some hard data about which versions are
actually used in practice and Kepler is not part of them. Luna will
probably stay, even though it will already be two years old by the time
Neon and Sirius 4.0 are released.

There is no plan yet to actively break compatibility with Juno, for
example by starting to adopt APIs which appeared only in later releases,
but from now on we're free to do it without particular notice if it
makes sense.

Note that this only concerns master and the future Sirius 4.0; it does
not change anything for all the active maintenance branches, where Juno
is still supported.
