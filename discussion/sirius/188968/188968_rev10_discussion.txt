DESCRIPTION:

[576305] Improve draw2d refresh for regions containers

This commit handles the specific cases of "a region size" impacted by
the size its regions container, itself impacted by a "brother region",
ie the regions container is itself a region and its width is impacted by
its brother.
For that, this commit adds a specific listener between the figure of the
region and its "parent figure" (not the direct parent, but the one with
the width change that must have effect).

The main changes are in AbstractDNodeContainerCompartmentEditPart. The
listener is added between the "container figure" and the "region
figure". The changes are focus on the "Capella Title Block" case. This
commit improves this case but as reminder, assembling multiple region
containers is not supported. And this commit is certainly not enough to
handle all assembly cases.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you explain why just the width and not the height as well?

Line:38, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/figure/ParentPropertyChangeListener.java -> I am not sure to follow why width resize is handled here but not the height

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes, the current problem concerns a regions container with VStack. Maybe there is a similar problem with HStack but it is not the current bug.

Line:38, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/figure/ParentPropertyChangeListener.java -> As explained in commit message, only this case is handled currently because it is the current problem. The assembly of several container regions is not "supported". Currently we try to improve situation but not to solve all problems.
