Line:82, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/suite/AllSiriusLongTestSuite.java -> ok but we add "long suites" but not individual long tests.
Do we have a lot of them, should not find a way to trigger them ?


We must warn the team or add a way to be sure htat we can detect that a test is tagged as unreliable/long and added in those suites, no?

Line:82, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/suite/AllSiriusLongTestSuite.java -> This is not an ideal solution. But I didn't find a better way to "group" all long tests.

There is no reason to launch this suite without the boolean skipLongTest equals to true, but it is better to add it.

There is no automatic way to check that all tests with "skipLongTest" is added in this suite. This is a manual step (included review step). I will notify the team as soon as this commit (and corresponding job will be done). I am adding, in the next patch set a note in the javadoc of shouldRunLongTests() and shouldSkipLongTests() about the existence of these suites.

Line:76, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/suite/SequenceSwtBotLongTestSuite.java -> Not sure to understand.

Line:76, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/suite/SequenceSwtBotLongTestSuite.java -> We have to add all tests of the class (even if some of them are not "long"). No way to add only a part of class.
