I have some remarks, but they may not be worth blocking the merge before M6. Except for a "clean" regen (incl. the VSM part), we can discuss/complete/adjust as necessary afterwards.

* Not sure it's a good idea to allow "Let" to change the value of "self". That's what ChangeContext does.
* Documentation (and mention in the release notes) will be needed before the ticket can be closed.
* The scope/lifetime of the variable is not clear to me. The docstring in the Ecore says "Once the variable is created, it will be bound with the name given here and will be available to any contained operation.":
  * The variable may already exist before, so technically a new binding is created in that case, but not a new variable.
  * Does it mean the variable is reset to its previous value (or completely removed) once we leave the scope of the "Let" operation? From the look of the code (LetTask), it seems the values are never unset, so they "leak" out of the lexical scope of the operation, and may cause actual memory leaks nobody unsets them.
* I'll see if regenerating the code on my machine avoids all the spurious changes in src-gen.
Line:735, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/diagram/operations/OperationTest.java -> "self" is rather special (not treated as such in the properties view code, but still); I'm not sure we want to allow "Let" to change its value, that's what ChangeContext does.

Line:1688, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/model/viewpoint.ecore -> Does it mean the variable disappears/is unset/reverted to its previous value once we leave the scope of "Let"?

Line:28, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/helper/task/operations/LetTask.java -> or change the value of an existing one.

Line:69, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/helper/task/operations/LetTask.java -> Not sure we want to allow this.

Line:735, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/diagram/operations/OperationTest.java -> But what should happen if the user specify "self" as the name of the variable then?

Line:1688, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/model/viewpoint.ecore -> Yes

Line:28, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/helper/task/operations/LetTask.java -> Done

Line:69, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/helper/task/operations/LetTask.java -> The main issue right now is that I underestimated the use of most of the code in the ForTask and this LetTask does leak the newly created variable for its siblings operation (and not only its child operations)
