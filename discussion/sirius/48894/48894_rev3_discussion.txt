DESCRIPTION:

[467508] Delete impossible after external modif of representations file

The commit [1] has a side effect. It adds the AirDCrossReferenceAdapter
to the ResourceSet instead of to the Resource. So during the reload
(unload) of the resource, in the issue scenario, the
AirDCrossReferenceAdapter is removed from the Resource. But when GMF is
called during delete through ViewUtil.destroy(View), it uses the
AirDCrossReferenceAdapter returned by the ResourceSet, but this last is
not correct as the Resource is not considered. Before this commit, with
the same scenario, GMF finds no CrossReferenceAdapter so it creates a
new one.
Now, the AirDCrossReferenceAdapter of the ResourceSet is added during
the reload (in ReloadRepresentationsFileCmd).
