DESCRIPTION:

[cleanup] Move 41MB XCF file out of the build path

The file is the "source" Gimp image used to create several PNGs for the
documentation, but by being put inside the main "src" folder which is in
the build.properties, it ends up in the final built JAR, where it is
useless and causes the JAR to be much larger than needed.

Move in into a new "assets" folder, designed to contained source
material than can help in producing the documentation, but does not need
to be in the resulting JAR.
