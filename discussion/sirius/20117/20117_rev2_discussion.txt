Laurent, a lot of new classes should not have been generated. you should complete the packages to ignore in the customize.properties files: ignore_packages = viewpoint,resource,diagram

I just realize that it was not done for sequence: the sequence package should be ignored too, I will create a bugzilla for it.

I think that contribution related classes should not be removed in this bug (You might just have forgotten to launch the contribution chain).
Line:606, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/editorPlugin/SiriusEditor.java -> Here we should have the qualified name. 
We have two different DescriptionPackage.

It can be a manual modification for now: a org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.editor will soon be created and its factories will be added through the call to DialectUIManager.INSTANCE.createAdapterFactory() which already handles Table, Tree and Sequence.

I did not detect other impacted points by the doublon DescriptionFactory.

Line:1, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/properties/ContributionLabelProvider.java -> I'm not sure Contribution related classes should be removed in this patch set / in this issue.

Line:1, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/properties/ContributionPropertySheetPage.java -> I'm not sure Contribution related classes should be removed in this patch set / in this issue.

Line:1, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/properties/filters/contribution/contribution/ContributionTargetFilter.java -> I'm not sure Contribution related classes should be removed in this patch set / in this issue.

Line:1, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/properties/filters/diagram/absoluteboundsfilter/AbsoluteBoundsFilterXFilter.java -> This class should not be generated. It is not "description" related.

Line:2, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/properties/sections/common/AbstractContributionPropertySection.java -> I'm not sure Contribution related classes should be removed in this patch set / in this issue.

Line:2, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/properties/sections/diagram/absoluteboundsfilter/AbsoluteBoundsFilterHeightPropertySection.java -> The diagram EPackage should be ignored during generation.

Line:2, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/wizards/DiagramModelWizard.java -> Diagram package should have been ignored during generation.

Line:606, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/editorPlugin/SiriusEditor.java -> Indeed, I added the diagram one in the user code.
