DESCRIPTION:

[495119] Compute GMF regions size according to container size

If the regions container has a predefined size, size defined in the VSM
(width and height computation expressions) or by the end-user at
creation, it is created with this predefined size. Its GMF layout
constraint is set with this predefined size.
During the first region creation, this size is reported to region and
the container size is set to {-1,-1}. Indeed, the size of the container
is computed from its children (except when it has no child).


KO TODO:
* Auto size of this kind of container.
* Collapse of a region (and size of container is larger that the
collapsed region)
* Is there a minimum size for container? 50 as height for vertical stack
seems too small. The figure size is of 63 pixels instead of 50.
