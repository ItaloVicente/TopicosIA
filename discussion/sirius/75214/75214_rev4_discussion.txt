DESCRIPTION:

[495119] Compute GMF regions size according to container size

If the regions container has a predefined size, size defined in the VSM
(width and height computation expressions) or by the end-user at
creation, it is created with this predefined size. Its GMF layout
constraint is set with this predefined size.
During the first region creation, this size is reported to region and
the container size is set to {-1,-1}. Indeed, the size of the container
is computed from its children (except when it has no child).


KO TODO:
* Auto size of this kind of container.
* Collapse of a region (and size of container is larger that the
collapsed region)
* Is there a minimum size for container? 50 as height for vertical stack
seems too small. The figure size is of 63 pixels instead of 50.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> need to override the default action

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not sure we can currently crate a RC with already collapsed regions

Line:191, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> should be initialized with an empty list and be passed to the computeRegionSize... method to populate it. Will ensure that the list will never be null.

Line:202, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> We might have several mappings to define the regions. c
Each of them might have its own VSM defined size. 

One of the dimension will have to be checked/warn during validation: we will put/compute a common width for vStack and common height for hStack.

Line:229, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> might depend on the mapping

Line:231, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> I keep my previous comment, I misunderstood the meaning of the defaultRegionSize which correspond to the previous maxCommonSize.

Line:231, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> might depend on the mapping, we need a map.

Line:260, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> We should document this for developers, and indicate that the RC will not be autosized only at creation time before the our first region layout operation of while there is no regions in it (even if the resize is currently forbidden if there is no regions).

Line:298, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> name should reflect that we test if the RC has a fixed size.

Line:314, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> should be renamed: it return the defaultregion size but it also populate the region bounds.

Line:327, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> not true now.
this is done at the end of the current layout operation

Line:335, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> see previous comment

Line:359, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> looks ok. 

Needs to be tested on RC and RC with hidden label or no labels

Line:438, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> not very strong. 
Does not take the MapMode into account
Should maybe at least point to a new constant in the AlphaDropShadowBorderClass: shift*2

Line:191, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> No sure about that. It's expected that this list is null if we don't compute it (if the region container has a size defined). So why create an empty list here?

Line:202, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> I agree, this is wht I speak about default size here. Because later in this method, we retain only width or height according to stack orientation.

Line:229, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> No. We are in the case that the container has a defined size. So the region defined size are ignored in this case (this will be added in the documentation).

Line:231, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> I don't use:
* commonWidth/commonHeight because the computation is now done for both width and height. So commonSize is not adapted because only one of the dimension is really common.
* "max" prefix is not adapted because at creation, the container size is used even if it is smaller than the region size.

So "default" seems to me the better name.

Line:231, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> Before, the variable used is commonHeight but there is no notion of map. Only one height can be use for each region of an horizontal stack.

Line:260, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> Yes, I have to change the documentation to explain all "new rules" concerning regions.

Line:298, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> Done

Line:314, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> Done! I also added javadoc to explain that

Line:438, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/RegionContainerUpdateLayoutOperation.java -> > Does not take the MapMode into account

We do not have acces to figure here...

> Should maybe at least point to a new constant in the AlphaDropShadowBorderClass: shift*2

I added a new API in AlphaDropShadowBorder. I voluntary not comment this in release note (as it is not really expected that it is used externally).
