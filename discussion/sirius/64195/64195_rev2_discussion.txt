Line:2, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/util/GMFNotationUtilities.java -> 2016

Line:78, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/util/GMFNotationUtilities.java -> isn't there a static final variable somewhere that corresponds to that tolerance?

Line:130, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/util/GMFNotationUtilities.java -> same remark
