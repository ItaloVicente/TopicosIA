DESCRIPTION:

[423037] Fix @not-generated related issue

Re-add some lost @not-generated.
Regen to populate the new collectNewChildDescriptorsGen methods.

Overrides getDiagramElementMapping() in diagram element spec classes to
avoid the not-generated annotation and be consistent with table and tree

TODO / TO DISCUSS 
 -> we could remove the not-generated on basicGetDiagramElementMapping
but  " throw new UnsupportedOperationException();" will be generated.
 -> we could mark the getDiagramElementMapping @not-generated back to
avoid duplication in several spec class (and facilitate diagram
extension which provide new type of DDiagramElement
 -> we should document why this was marked as @not-generated (to keep
the legacy behavior for cdo native implementation)
