Line:1, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> * I prefer to not add "#437528: " here.
* Simpler title : "Force edge to point to the center of a border node"

Line:5, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> "to force edges toward the center" ... it seems strange

Another wording : This evolution allows the specifier to force edgers to point to the center of a border node.

Line:18, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> "The first edge aims at the center" --> The first edge, the highest one, aims the center

Line:19, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> Add also here the 2 improvements made by this evolution with screenshot :
* Port alignment = automatic egde alignment
* Facilitate the layout of several edges on one node

Line:24, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> "will be forced to "auto-anchor"." --> "auto-anchor" means nothing...

Line:37, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> h3. Move

Line:48, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> "limitation" --> Limitation

Line:50, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> "Draw2D TRY to privilege" --> tries

Line:65, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> * "two more attributes" --> two additional attributes
* the specifier can choose only border node mapping ? why this spec is only for border node?

Line:69, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> "two more boolean attributes" --> two additional boolean attributes

Line:91, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> "the specifier has choose" --> the specifier has chooseN

Line:5, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> Typo: "edgers" => "edges".

Why limit this new feature to bordered nodes?

Line:8, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> Do we ever use this? If so, this should be v0.2 at least.

Line:15, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> Typo: "[a]esthetic"

Line:65, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> How will this interact with mapping imports? For example, given Edge Mapping E between A and B mentions that it wants to be centered on A:
* What happens to instances of the edge mapping between A' and B, where A' is a mapping import which remplaces A?
* What happens edge mapping imports which override  E? Do they inherit the "centered anchor" settings from E? If the import specifies "centered anchor" settings do they replace the ones in E or are they added?
* What happens when we combine the two cases above (edge mapping import and node mapping imports)?

Also, can a specifier say "always center the source (or target, or both)", so that mappings not accessible at the time he specifies the edge (because they are not yet created) will automatically be centered without requiring manual edition of the "centered" list?

Line:94, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/centeredAnchors/437528.textile -> Tests needed with complex cases of mapping imports and diagram extensions.
