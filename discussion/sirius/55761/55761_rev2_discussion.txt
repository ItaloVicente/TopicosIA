DESCRIPTION:

[477211] Make the DDiagramElementContainer name parts non selectable

The previous behavior is common between DNodeList and DNodeContainer
name edit parts since Bug 424417 in which code from container name parts
have been duplicated in list name parts. 

The getParent().isSelectable() == EditPart.SELECTED has been introduce
before the move to open source. 

This test is weird, it make the name part selectable only when the main
part is in secondary selection (see EditPart.SELECTED vs
EditPart.SELECTED_PRIMARY). Furthermore, the container/list/region name
parts cannot be moved and the direct edit works. So we can simply always
return false in isSelectable().

The IllegalArgumentException occured because the drag tracker saw the
name edit part as a selectable part (its parent is secondary selected)
but during the set selection the AbstractEditPartView call
primDeselectAll() which change the isSelectable() status of the
DDiagramElementContainer name edit parts.
