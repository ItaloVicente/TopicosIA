DESCRIPTION:

[463546] Add the method isUnsynchronizable in DialectServices.

Add the method isUnsynchronizable(RepresentationDescription) to know if
the RepresentationDescription's dialect support the unsynchronized mode.

This change is needed in order to hide the DeleteView operation in table
and tree tools in the next commits. Moreover, it was hidden only for the
first operation of table and tree tools before, but with this change, it
will be possible to hide it at every hierarchy level of operations.

Not convinced it's a good idea to break the DialectServices API for a minor feature, especially in the context of Sirius 3.1 where we want to minimize API changes. OTOH, I'm not aware of any adopter who have developed their own dialects, so +2 for the moment. Unless you can thinhk of a different way to get the same result without a new API.

Actually, after thinking more about this, I'd rather see a different solution. Instead of introducing a new API in a core interface for a very specific purpose, I'd rather extend the DialectUIServices interface, which already contains methods allowing dialects to tweak which elements are available in the VSM editor's context menu.

Unfortunately, the existing methods (provideNewChildDescriptors, provideRepresentationCreationToolDescriptors, provideRepresentationNavigationToolDescriptors etc.) are all additive, i.e. they allow a dialect to contribute new elements, but they do not allow them to remove some.

So, the idea would be to add a generic capability for dialects to say "this operation/mapping/tool does not make sense in my case". Something like:

  boolean DialectUIServices.handles(CommandParameter param)

It's probably a little too generic in such a form, and would require too many changes in all collectNewChildDescriptors() to fully implement. I'll try to think of a better, less impacting design.
