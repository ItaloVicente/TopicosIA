DESCRIPTION:

[430263] Remove the ModelingProjectManagerStartup startup extension

This extension implies that if Sirius is installed, a large part of
Sirius plugins are getting loaded and started even if your are not using
it.

The sessionManagerListener of ModelingProjectManagerImpl, previously
added by this extension point, is now added during the loading of the
first session.
The initialization of a modeling project (detect if the modeling project
is valid, ie with one and only one representations file) is now done at
the first access of this project and not at the Eclipse start.

Warning: If the Sirius Content Management is active (for example in
"Project Explorer"), Sirius plugins are getting loaded and started even
with this fix.

Line:128, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/manager/ModelingProjectManagerImpl.java -> Currently, session of opened modeling projects are open/loaded during startup. And the open on expand seems to occurs in several limited cases (restart ?)
This is a major change from the user side: no session will be loaded 

We could add this job during the initalization of the SiriusCommonContentProvider or maybe in org.eclipse.sirius.ui.tools.api.views.modelexplorerview.resourcelistener.DefaultModelingProjectResourceListener.init() (called from org.eclipse.sirius.viewpoint.provider.SiriusEditPlugin.Implementation.start(BundleContext))

Line:79, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/manager/ModelingProjectManagerImpl.java -> We coud add the opening session in sessionFilesLoading  if not present.

Line:97, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/manager/ModelingProjectManagerImpl.java -> This should be a set.

Line:128, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/manager/ModelingProjectManagerImpl.java -> "This is a major change from the user side: no session will be loaded" --> No session was loaded before (just the status of ModelingProject was checked at the start of Eclipse. And it is not necesseraly useful.

"We could add this job during the initalization of the SiriusCommonContentProvider or maybe in ...DefaultModelingProjectResourceListener.init() ...", yes maybe, but this can have side effects.
A discussion about the effort to add this listener to stay with the same behavior should be discuss in the issue. What do you think?

Line:79, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/manager/ModelingProjectManagerImpl.java -> There is no change in this code, why impact it?

Line:97, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/manager/ModelingProjectManagerImpl.java -> Not necessarily for the use that one makes. And once again, there is no change in this code, why impact it?

Line:128, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/manager/ModelingProjectManagerImpl.java -> No session was loaded before : ok: during startup, we only shcedule a InitializeModelingProjectJob and not a InitializeModelingProjectJob and a OpenRepresentationsFileJob. 

 "the status of ModelingProject was checked at the start of Eclipse. And it is not necesseraly useful." ->  I'm not sure of this.

org.eclipse.sirius.ui.tools.api.views.modelexplorerview.resourcelistener.DefaultModelingProjectResourceListener.resourceChanged(IResourceChangeEvent)  and the ResourceDeltaVisitor handle the added/imported/changed/open projects (see ResourceDeltaVisitor.projectsToInitializeAndLoad and ResourceDeltaVisitor.projectsToInitialize).

I think that we should move the InitializeModelingProjectJob from the startup DefaultModelingProjectResourceListener.init() to keep the actual behavior. Now its the starting of Sirius which will trigger this job and not the IStartup and this job which will trigger the start of the Sirius plugins.

Line:79, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/manager/ModelingProjectManagerImpl.java -> I just saw it during this review as a potential issue.

It could be corrected as a cleanup step / continuous improvement done during the current bug.

The current listener is added during loadAndOpenRepresentationsFiles but not removed, if someone open a session from an other entry point, it will be notified and should add it to the sessionFilesLoading set (see the other comment) to mark it as "in loading state".

If this cleanup does not seem safe enough, i will create a separated bugzilla.

Line:97, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/manager/ModelingProjectManagerImpl.java -> The actual implementation of  loadAndOpenRepresentationsFiles currently guarantees that there is no duplicated uris in this list. 

Then the  sessionManagerListener removes one occurence of each OPENED session. 

So replacing this list by a set is a safe change to hopefully prevent some future potential issue.

Line:128, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/manager/ModelingProjectManagerImpl.java -> No change.
There is no need to call InitializeModelingProjectJob  from the startup DefaultModelingProjectResourceListener.init() to keep the actual behavior. Indeed, it is indirectly done by the Sirius label provider (used by CNF), that for each project asks the mani representations file and indirectly validate the session.

Line:79, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/manager/ModelingProjectManagerImpl.java -> Not agree, there is a potential risk of concurrent modification by adding a "add" here.

Line:97, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/modelingproject/manager/ModelingProjectManagerImpl.java -> Done
