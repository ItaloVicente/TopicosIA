DESCRIPTION:

[567517] Do not trigger Sequence layout for non impacted diagrams

- Rework RefreshLayoutScope to check that the modified GMF View elements
belongs to the Sequence Diagram which is concerned by the current
RefreshLayoutScope or by a Sequence Diagram which has the same semantic
target.

- Rework RefreshLayoutScope notification analysis
  - Check that WorkspaceImage case concerns the current DDiagram (but
containsSetWkpImgApplication continues to always return null).
  - Rework getValues in order to reduce code duplication.
  - Add shortcut if valueView corresponds to notifier view has it has
already been analyzed.

- Fix RefreshLayoutScopeAsserter to analyze the notifications in a
"isAny" way instead of a "isFirst" way.

- Add a test and rename RefreshLayoutNotExecutedOnNoSequenceChangesTests
into RefreshLayoutScopeTests.
