DESCRIPTION:

[465328] Fix "vibrates" problem during the oblique edge move

* The LabelHelper has an asymmetrical problem in there methods. A bug
has been created in GMF project for that, bug 476305. This problem
explains the "vibrates" problem described in comment 10 of bug 465328.
* Another approach is now used directly coded in
EdgeLabelsComputationUtil.
** So LabelHelper2 is no longer used. And LabelHelperTest has been
removed. It is proposed in a patch directly in GMF bug 476305.
* The test testLabelStabilityWhenMovingNodeOfObliqueEdgeSeveralTimes()
has been added in EdgeLabelsMoveTest.
* The tolerance was removed from many oblique edges tests and reduced
for all remaining ones.
