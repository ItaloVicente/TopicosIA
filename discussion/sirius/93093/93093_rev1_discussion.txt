Line:413, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> a picture of an example would be great with a tooltip because it is difficult as a specifier not knowing what is it to see the potential of this functionality for your representations. TO be sure of what it is you have to create one.

Line:416, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> a picture of the properties of each would be great from my specifier point of view. It is easir to understand the next part about decoration display if we can associate the text with the graphic.

Line:418, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> missing or useless text

Line:422, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> NORTH_WEST, NORTH, NORTH_EAST, SOUTH_WEST, SOUTH, SOUTH_EAST, EAST, WEST, CENTER (missing north west and better visualization in this order)

Line:422, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> The picture you use for your spec which show a diagram element with all the zone would be great because it is difficult to understand what center position mean. Were does the north position stop to let the center position be expressed and so on.

Line:424, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> don't want to check all documentation to know what it is. Here again picture speaks better than text. I know you have good picture in your spec for that

Line:426, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> are

Line:426, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> if you say so. Maybe a picture to illustrate it because I don't understand. 
Also you introduce the group concept that is not clear without a picture.
Centered from what referential?

Line:427, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> again a picture would help to visualize what it really means

Line:430, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> relative, absolute? THe help in property view shows it is the workspace project relative path. Provide same information with example.

Line:435, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> an example picture of the result! The specifier must know what it looks like without having to create and test one.

Line:435, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> no space in english

Line:440, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> ns

Line:440, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> picture too

Line:440, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> pictureeeeeeeee!

Line:440, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> to

Line:952, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/user/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> g.

Line:952, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/user/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> ns

Line:424, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.textile -> I put a picture but I don't want to be too much technical here. Note that decorations existed before and there was nothing to explain.
