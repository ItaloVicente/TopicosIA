Few minor typos, but 2 questions:

1/ Shouldn't we disable the OpenRepresentationsAction by overriding isEnabled() or through the ContextMenuFiller ?

2/ What about the OpenRepresentationAction (without "s") ?
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> has "a" target element

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> (e.g. an EMF proxy ?)

Line:110, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/actions/session/OpenRepresentationsAction.java -> Shouldn't we also disable this action (by returning "false" to isEnabled() or modify the context menu filler) ? 

What about OpenRepresentationAction (without "s") ?

Line:94, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/navigator/SiriusCommonLabelProvider.java -> A little comment here would be nice (but not mandatory)

The last time i checked, the open was not availabe on dangling representation. On a multi selection, i think in this case if at least one representation can be open we should make the action enabled. The dangling representation are displayed in gray, the user should see there is something different.

2/ What about the OpenRepresentationAction (without "s") ?
BElongs to the Tree dialect and is used only to open the navigable representation opening menus on each available representation computed from the current semantic element and DialectManager.INSTANCE.getRepresentations, so we cannot get a danglign representation here. Furthermore this is an internal action, not impacted by the current bug but I will add a note in its javadoc in th enext patch set, indicating the caller has to check the representation to open is not a dangling reprsentation

Done in next patch.

I re-put -2 as I discovered some issue during menu computation and multi selection after your remarks. 

We currently check only the first selected representation while building the representation action (open, delete, export, ..). We should remove the dangling representations from the selection passed to the actions (except for delete) or as propsoed by Alex, customize their isEnabled() methods.
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I will put samples on the query.

Line:110, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/actions/session/OpenRepresentationsAction.java -> See answer on the review's page

Line:94, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/navigator/SiriusCommonLabelProvider.java -> Done

I remove my -2, after some tests done with multi selection coantaining several dangling and non dangling representations. The displayed actions do not produce errors even with dangling representation in a multi selection. 
I propose to create a separated commit/bug to rewrite the corresponding code in ContextMenuFiller: the real issue of the lack of session check is thaht we could create an action dealing with representation of several sessions.
