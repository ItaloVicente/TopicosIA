DESCRIPTION:

[427803] Generate edit plugin - 1

The commits "Generate edit plugin" concern changes in
org.eclipse.sirius.ui and
org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui corresponding to the edit regen (and
the corresponding refactoring in these plugins).
It also contains the changes caused by the refactoring of the previous
commit (model regen)

1 other commit follows with the editor generation (and
corresponding refactoring).
The compilation is not OK. That's normal. The most difficult cases will
be dealt later, one by one.

After discussion, it is more simpler to move all classes from
/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src to /org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src.
Indeed, originally, the plugin org.eclipse.sirius.diagram has for ui
aspects. So to have a result more quickly, it was decided to move all
these classes. There will be probably another step to isolate more
precisely some classes that could go again in
org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.

The commit "Generate edit plugin - 1" contains only (or almost) move of
files without changes to keep history. Indeed, if the move and the
refactoring are made together GIT lost the history of all moved files.
