The fact that we no longer propagate the exceptions during the save is a regression cause by #445603.

For the 2.0.x maintenance branch, we probably want something like your patch, which at least allows sub-classes to have access to the IStatus and react to it if they want to.

For master where we can change the APIs, I think it would be better to actually propagate the IStatus all the way to Session.save(). Except that when the actual save is deferred in post-commit, if Session.save() is called during a transaction it will return before the save has been performed...
