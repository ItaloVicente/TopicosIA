DESCRIPTION:

[496065] Remove required features in properties model

With the extends feature, some existing required structural features are
not anymore required. This patch fixes the meta-model accordingly.
Some of these structural features are still required if no extends is
defined, in this case a special constraint was added in order to check
the model validity.

While I understand the need behind this review, I think it requires more work (what about custom widgets?) and I don't think we can integrate it this close to the final release.
Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why some? Wouldn't that impact all the required structural features of the meta-model?

Line:34, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/plugin.properties -> Aren't there a lot more use cases than this?

Line:22, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/internal/validation/description/constraints/Messages.java -> Use the already existing Messages class of the plugin. We don't need two classes with the same name, doing the same thing in the same plugin.

Line:1, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/internal/validation/description/constraints/PropertiesConstraint.java -> Why such a complicated package hierarchy? The Javadoc is missing

Line:24, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/internal/validation/description/constraints/PropertiesConstraint.java -> Why? Missing Javadoc

Line:234, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/internal/validation/description/constraints/PropertiesConstraint.java -> You do not need to create a method to use "!"

Line:69, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.edit/plugin.xml -> To remove

Line:16, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Why do we need to have a dependency to this plugin here?

Line:19, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> why do this package is imported in an import package? why is this imported in the plugin of our meta-model?
