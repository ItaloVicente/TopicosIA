DESCRIPTION:

[cleanup] Remove dead (and broken) code

Two of the methods in SpecificSessionManager actually did nothing (they
tried to work on the session field, which was never set to anything).
The last method was not called anywhere. The whole class was only
referenced from SpecificEditorInputTranformer but never actually used
there.
