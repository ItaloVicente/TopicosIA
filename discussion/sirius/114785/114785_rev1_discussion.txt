DESCRIPTION:

[521467] Increase delta used when testing for exported image size

On some systems, exported images are 2 pixels wider than expected:

   expected:<4956.0> but was:<4958.0>

It's not clear why exactly, but it may be related to different fonts
or DPIs. It does not seem worth failing the tests, especially given
that the image export API does not provide any strong guarantee on the
actual sizes.

Line:655, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/api/dialect/ExportAsImageTest.java -> shouldn't this be changed too then?

Line:655, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/api/dialect/ExportAsImageTest.java -> On principle I agree it would be more consistent, but on systems where the test fails it's always only the width that is wrong. Actually I'm not sure yet merging this would be good idea, it will depend on the time we can spend on trying to understand the root cause of the difference and fix that instead of changing the test.

Line:655, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/api/dialect/ExportAsImageTest.java -> okay, fine for me.

No idea if this helps you at all, but I have seen bounding box tests fail in completely unrelated projects due to different anti-aliasing settings in the Windows Operating system ("cleartype"). maybe your test also depends on that somehow?
