DESCRIPTION:

[423037] WIP - Split diagram EPackage.

This commit moves classes corresponding to Diagram from viewpoint and
viewpoint/description packages respectively in viewpoint/diagram and
viewpoint/diagram/description packages.
Only compilation problems of org.eclipse.sirius are fixed to allow a
first review.

The fix in other Sirius plugins will be fixed later.

I found several differences which require some discussion.

I think a pass on {@link ...} in non generated javadoc should be planned when the split will be completed.
Line:4127, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/model/viewpoint.ecore -> The DiagramDescription.informationSection reference has been removed. Is this wanted ?

<eStructuralFeatures xsi:type="ecore:EReference" name="informationSections"
          upperBound="-1" eType="#//description/audit/InformationSection" containment="true">
 ...
<

Line:1266, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/model/viewpoint.genmodel -> Before the move to the diagram package, image="true" but this was an error as AbstractDNode is abstract and does not need any image.

I'm ok with this difference.

Line:384, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/DiagramDescriptionImpl.java -> The DiagramDescription.informationSection reference has been removed. Is this wanted ?

Line:1009, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/DiagramDescriptionImpl.java -> The DiagramDescription.informationSection reference has been removed. Is this wanted ?

Line:377, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/DiagramImportDescriptionImpl.java -> The DiagramDescription.informationSection reference has been removed. Is this wanted ?

Line:492, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/impl/ToolFactoryImpl.java -> It seems it should already have been @generated and not @not-generated in the previous version.

Line:562, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/impl/ToolFactoryImpl.java -> It seems it should already have been @generated and not @not-generated in the previous version.

Line:51, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/componentization/DiagramDescriptionMappingsManager.java -> It should be "collection of Viewpoints"

Line:210, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/componentization/DiagramMappingsManager.java -> Wrong link it should be org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.description.NodeMapping.

Other wrong links might exist.

Line:59, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/helper/display/DisplayService.java -> This javadoc comment could be corrected.

Line:466, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/query/DiagramElementMappingQuery.java -> This class was maybe not correctly formated before.

Line:83, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/metamodel/helper/LayerHelper.java -> Wrong link, see imports.

Line:218, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/metamodel/operations/DDiagramElementContainerSpecOperations.java -> I think this was named getParentViewpoint() when a viewpoint was a diagram. 

I would prefer to rename this method into getParentDDiagram().

This is called from DDiagramElementContainer  *Spec implementation classes to implement the getParentDiagram() method inherited from DDiagramElement.

Line:231, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/validation/description/constraints/ExistingExpressionVariablesConstraint.java -> Should be renamed into checkDiagramDescriptionPrecondition

Line:248, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/validation/description/constraints/ExistingExpressionVariablesConstraint.java -> Should be renamed into checkDiagramElementMappingPrecondition

Line:264, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/validation/description/constraints/ExistingExpressionVariablesConstraint.java -> Should be renamed into checkDiagramElementMappingSemanticCandidates

Line:280, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/validation/description/constraints/ExistingExpressionVariablesConstraint.java -> Should be renamed into checkDiagramElementMappingSemanticElements

Line:727, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/validation/description/constraints/ExistingExpressionVariablesConstraint.java -> Should not be removed but renamed into caseDiagramDescription.

The SiriusDescription to DiagramDescription should be done on check methods too.

Line:744, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/validation/description/constraints/ExistingExpressionVariablesConstraint.java -> Should not be removed but renamed into caseDiagramElementMapping.

The SiriusElementMapping to DiagramElementMapping should be done on check methods too.

Maxime, I've considered your comments. Wait the next patch set...
Line:4127, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/model/viewpoint.ecore -> Yes. This corresponds to an old feature used by Information view. This view has been removed since a long time.
The eType has been mapped to a bad type during the removing of same class name "InformationSection" in another package.

Line:1266, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/model/viewpoint.genmodel -> Done

Line:384, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/DiagramDescriptionImpl.java -> Yes as explained in viewpoint.ecore.

Line:1009, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/DiagramDescriptionImpl.java -> Yes.

Line:377, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/DiagramImportDescriptionImpl.java -> Yes, see previous comment.

File Comment: plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/impl/ToolFactoryImpl.java -> I also change the createDeleteElementDescription according to commit b30568b.
Line:492, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/impl/ToolFactoryImpl.java -> There is a mistake here. If you compare with commit b30568b (before starts of work on this issue), the code is "not-generated". But the current code is not the not-generated one.

Line:562, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/impl/ToolFactoryImpl.java -> It's OK according to commit b30568b (before starts of work on this issue),

Line:51, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/componentization/DiagramDescriptionMappingsManager.java -> Done

Line:210, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/componentization/DiagramMappingsManager.java -> Done

Line:466, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/query/DiagramElementMappingQuery.java -> Same code as before.

Line:83, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/metamodel/helper/LayerHelper.java -> Done
