DESCRIPTION:

[423037] Split diagram EPackage-org.eclipse.sirius

This commit moves classes corresponding to Diagram from viewpoint and
viewpoint/description packages respectively in viewpoint/diagram and
viewpoint/diagram/description packages.
It contains the generation of org.eclipse.sirius according to these changes and only compilation problems of org.eclipse.sirius are fixed to allow a first review.

The fix in other Sirius plugins will be fixed later.

I found several difference which requires correction. 

I still have to compare the genmodel to check that we do not lose any information.
Line:335, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/model/viewpoint.ecore -> This FilterVariableValue should be moved to diagram package too (and mayby other type which use this).

It references the FilterVariable which has been moved. 

Another solution is to introduce an abstract type or interface in viewpoint package.

The issue will appear during the split into 2 ecore files / plugins.

Line:348, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/model/viewpoint.genmodel -> Detected difference in property description.

This one seems ok.

Line:361, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/model/viewpoint.genmodel -> Detected difference in property description.

Descriptions has now its plural form: ok

Line:151, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/DNode.java -> We should directly have LabelPosition here.

Line:53, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/NodeStyle.java -> We should directly have LabelPosition here.

Line:133, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/DiagramDescription.java -> We should directly have FilterDescription here.

Line:81, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/EdgeMapping.java -> A new line seems to have been added.

Line:348, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/DiagramDescriptionImpl.java -> There should be an import in the import section.

Line:791, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/DiagramDescriptionImpl.java -> There should be an import in the import section.

Line:1749, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/DiagramDescriptionImpl.java -> There should be an import in the import section.

Line:341, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/DiagramImportDescriptionImpl.java -> There should be an import in the import section.

Line:1787, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/DiagramImportDescriptionImpl.java -> There should be an import in the import section.

Line:363, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/EdgeMappingImpl.java -> Gerrit shows a whitespace error here.

Line:545, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/DescriptionPackage.java -> This change could indicate that a format was forgotten after the regen.

Line:131, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/audit/impl/AuditPackageImpl.java -> The FilterPackage and FilterPackageImpl should be imported in the import section.

This is another point to check when the diagram.ecore will be in its own file/plugin.

Line:60, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/concern/ConcernDescription.java -> This should be imported in the import section.

Line:104, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/concern/impl/ConcernDescriptionImpl.java -> This should be imported in the import section.

Line:106, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/style/NodeStyleDescription.java -> This should reuse the declared import.

If this come from the generator, the qualified name will probably be replaced by the simple name when the style package will be moved into the diagram.description package.

Line:191, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/style/StyleFactory.java -> New line introduced and whitespace error detected by gerrit.

Line:29, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/style/TooltipStyleDescription.java -> Format difference.

Line:133, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/DirectEditLabel.java -> The generated comments are now in the user doc. 

It could be a manual merge error.

Line:68, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/ReconnectEdgeDescription.java -> Format difference, might come from a manual merge.

Line:33, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/util/DescriptionResourceImpl.java -> This constructor was not generated before.

Line:42, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/NsURIMigrationParticipant.java -> Ok, because all the filter package has been moved to diagram.

See my response in each file.
Line:335, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/model/viewpoint.ecore -> I will move FilterVariableValue and FilterVariableHistory.

Line:348, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/model/viewpoint.genmodel -> This corresponds to a modification made directly in generated class but not in genmodel. I reported it in genmodel.
So yes it's OK.

Line:361, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/model/viewpoint.genmodel -> OK. Nothing to add.

Line:151, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/DNode.java -> No this corresponds to generated code and the "organize imports" action leaves it in this state.

Line:53, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/NodeStyle.java -> No this corresponds to generated code and the "organize imports" action leaves it in this state.

Line:133, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/DiagramDescription.java -> No this corresponds to generated code and the "organize imports" action leaves it in this state.

Line:81, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/EdgeMapping.java -> It's normal: "new line before @tag".

Line:348, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/DiagramDescriptionImpl.java -> No this corresponds to generated code and the "organize imports" action leaves it in this state.

Line:363, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/impl/EdgeMappingImpl.java -> It's the "normal" format.

Line:545, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/DescriptionPackage.java -> I don't see change where you added comment.

Line:131, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/audit/impl/AuditPackageImpl.java -> No this corresponds to generated code and the "organize imports" action leaves it in this state.

Line:191, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/style/StyleFactory.java -> No this corresponds to generated code and the "organize imports" action leaves it in this state.

Line:29, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/style/TooltipStyleDescription.java -> Yes. And now it's the good one.

Line:133, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/DirectEditLabel.java -> Done

Line:68, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/ReconnectEdgeDescription.java -> Yes. And now, it's the good one.

Line:33, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/util/DescriptionResourceImpl.java -> Yes, it has been probably manually deleted. I will add a @not-generated and pass this constructor to proteceted.

Line:42, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/NsURIMigrationParticipant.java -> Done
