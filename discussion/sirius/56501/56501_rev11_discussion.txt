DESCRIPTION:

[478080] Process ReloadingPolicy actions within a single transaction

Post-commit listeners are currently notified X times during Session
reload where X might be the number of resources. This commit make sure
all the changes related to the reloading are wrapped in a global
read-write transaction so that the post-commit listeners (and
SaveSessionWhenNoDialectEditorsListener) are notified only once. Without
this change any post-commit listener who reacts by for instance, saving
the Session, might save an inconsistent state.

Notable changes from an event perspective :
SessionListener.ABOUT_TO_BE_REPLACED and SessionListener.REPLACED will
now be fired only once for a batch of changes instead of X times for X
resource which is being reloaded.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> This should be documented in the release note.

Line:84, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/SessionResourcesSynchronizer.java -> I feel like we could miss some resource status change. 
If notification in progress is true, and if we are notified of a new set of changes, those changes might impact different files, might not they ?

Line:184, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/SessionResourcesSynchronizer.java -> Should not we remove the resourcesToRemove from resroucesToReload ?

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:84, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/SessionResourcesSynchronizer.java -> That's right, and it's now a long time ago so I'm not sure whether that was intended or not. 

I'll submit a new patch which moves all the processing in a static method so that any other thread will be blocked and will wait instead of -- possibly --  leading to ignored events.

Line:184, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/SessionResourcesSynchronizer.java -> The reloading policy will either return a RELOAD or a DELETE for the resource but can't return both, there can't be any intersection.
