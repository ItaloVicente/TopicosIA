DESCRIPTION:

[498341] Fix bad feedback when dragging bordered node in layouting mode

When layouting mode is enabled, the drop feedback for simple node was
still displayed but
nothing was done during the drop command execution.

Now, when a node is dragged outside of its container, the forbidden
figure will be displayed and it will not be shifted when dropping

The method handleAutoexpose() has been overridden to handle a difficult
repeatable case were the node would be shifted in its parent when
dropping on a position outside of its parent.  
Yet the fix is not complete. It is missing a case were the dragged node
is put closed to the edge of the diagram. In this situation the node is
missing its forbidden figure. The problem is related to the method
NoCopyDragEditPartsTrackerEx.handleAutoexpose() and the class
SiriusScroller.
