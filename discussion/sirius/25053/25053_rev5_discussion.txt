DESCRIPTION:

[430724] isModified-based default SavingPolicy

A new default SavingPolicy which relies on the Resouces.isModified
attribute and cross resources dependencies to compute the list of
resources to actually save.

The old default is still available as
org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.session.SavingPolicyImpl and can be
setup explicitly through Session.setSavingPolicy() for users that want
to keep the old behavior.

Patch Set 5:

Patch Set 2 differs from the first one in the following ways:
1. Renamed IsModifiedSavePolicy into IsModifiedSavingPolicy to match the interface name.
2. Moved the 2 predicates as private static classes; despite their name they are not completely generic and deal with resource modifications, not references in general. It also avoid leaking Guava-specific types from oes.ext.emf.
3. In ResourceHasReferenceTo, simplified the body using Iterators.any().
4. In EObjectHasReferencesTo, extracted the retrieval of referenced elements into a separate method, which avoid a branch and allows for simplified flow with direct return (no more explicit iterator + boolean flag in the loop). Also changed the named to be less generic (eObj, eObject => source, target), which I believe caught a bug in the initial version; in the branch for multi-valued references, the original did:

    if (!eObject.eIsProxy()) {
        if (modifiedResources.apply(eObj.eResource())) {
            foundAReference = true;
         }
    }

   which was testing on the resource of the source object (eObject), not on the target/referenced object (eObject).
5. Simplified the body of underlyingFileIsDeletedOrConflicting by directly returning the boolean.
6. Extracted the computation of resourcesToSave into a separate method, computeResourcesToSave, which was then streamlined (but should be strictly equivalent).
7. Made the new policy the default in DAnalysisSessionImpl (at least temporarily to allow testing).

Same comment as above, hopefully nicer formatting (we'll see...).
