DESCRIPTION:

[461590] StyleHelper cleanup

Update style size expression in only one place. 
This will be done during update only, like its evaluation. This
attribute should be removed from the BorderedStyle EClass. 

There is no need to do it during each updateXXX method event if those
are called from the createXXXStyle methods: the refresh style is always
called just after creation.

BorderedStyle.borderSizeComputationExpression is never evaluated: the
BorderedStyle.borderSize is set after the evaluation of
BorderedStyleDescription.borderSizeComputationExpression.
Consequently the corresponding check in
CheckStyleCreationForStyleDescSwitch of StyleHelperTest has been
removed.
