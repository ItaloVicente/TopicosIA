DESCRIPTION:

[461498] Register Sirius's packages during expression validation

Use the IInterpretedExpressionQuery infrastructure to add the dialect
EPackages in the list of EPackages an interpreter should use to validate
the expressions.

For each Dialect the 'Representation' EPackage is added as it is
generaly used even in variable types. Each 'Description' package is also
added under the rational that it is not so uncommon to have expressions
using the representationElement->Mapping reference to check names for
instance.

Line:83, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/internal/dialect/description/DiagramInterpretedExpressionQuery.java -> You are not consistent with Tree and Table: you should add DescriptionPackage and subPackages.

And sub diagram types ? 
See SequenceDiagramTypeProvider and its "interpreterswitch". 

The getPackageToImport should allow to retrieve the Sequence diagram ype metamodels.

Line:83, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/internal/dialect/description/DiagramInterpretedExpressionQuery.java -> I'll do it for the Diagram and Description subpackages. As for the SequenceDiagram as you mentionned that would have to be made through IInterpretedExpressionTargetSwitch (that means more API breakage), based on the current state of the code that would also introduce a dependency to the UI. That's a lot of "side-effects" on the code for a change which would only make sense *if* the user uses some of the specifics sequence diagram types in its queries, and there is the workaround of referencing the sequence Ecore packages directly then.

Line:83, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/internal/dialect/description/DiagramInterpretedExpressionQuery.java -> The change could somethink like org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.business.api.diagramtype.IDiagramDescriptionProvider.createInterpretedExpressionSwitch(EStructuralFeature, IInterpretedExpressionTargetSwitch)


Another solution could be in .AbstractInterpretedExpressionQuery.getPackagesToImport(): we retrieve the current representation, we could just get the EPackage of its eClass() and retrieve the other ones (currently the subpackages)
