DESCRIPTION:

[437528] Fix wrong rectilinear bendpoints at opening.

* In some cases, the GMF bendpoints coordinates can be very far away
from the ones
displayed by Draw2D, especially when there are only two bendpoints(they
are always connected to the source and target figure, so the shift is
not visible). If the edge
centering property changes at opening and the edge is rectilinear, we
compute its rectilinear bounds from the GMF informations (since we don't
have the figure yet) to center the last segment toward the node center.
This fix prevents wrong rectilinear bounds by
computing them from the expected GMF bendpoints.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> "informations" --> informations

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> "from the expected GMF bendpoints." --> not clear here... "from the GMF bounds of source and target nodes" is perhaps more clear.

Line:87, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/CenterEdgeEndModelChangeOperation.java -> ConnectionEditPart is now retained by this Operation. Are you sure this Operation is "disposed" or have we a new memory leak caused by the ConnectionEditPart?

Line:253, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/CenterEdgeEndModelChangeOperation.java -> "informations" --> information

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> information ok

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> I agree. fixed!

Line:87, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/CenterEdgeEndModelChangeOperation.java -> After having analyse with "Eclipe Memory Analyser" the operation does not seem to be retained once the session is closed.

Line:253, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/operation/CenterEdgeEndModelChangeOperation.java -> Done
