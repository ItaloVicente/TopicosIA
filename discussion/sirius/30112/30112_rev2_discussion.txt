DESCRIPTION:

[439871] Draft of the Sirius Headless Spec

The "detailled specification" is fairly light but right now I
need to gather comments :
- are there other choices and tradeoffs you are aware of ?
- do you foresee any issue with the choices being made here ?
- other missing piece or concern ?

Line:65, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/439871_headless/439871.textile -> Cedric, if those test are then run with the UI plugins, you might have different result: for example, the "auto-save" (Save when no editor is open), will save the session at the end of each transaction when there is no opened editor.

Line:38, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/439871_headless/439871.textile -> Export as image? It's difficult for diagram to do it without UI dependencies...

Line:68, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/439871_headless/439871.textile -> "Some Tests" --> "Some tests"

"have (like those in the StandaloneTestSuite will " --> "have (like those in the StandaloneTestSuite) will "

Line:97, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/439871_headless/439871.textile -> "stays in the diagram.ui plugin but is getting called from the o.e.s.diagram when necessary" --> this is problematic, there is no dependency between o.e.s.diagram and o.e.s.diagram.ui.

Line:120, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/439871_headless/439871.textile -> +1

Line:138, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/439871_headless/439871.textile -> "a/b/c/d/e" --> "1/2/3/4/5" in generated HTML file

Line:33, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/439871_headless/439871.textile -> Diagram creation triggers an Arrange All, and the actual layout code is deep inside Draw2D. We could decide to create a diagram with no layout in this case but it is not very satisfactory.

Line:54, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/439871_headless/439871.textile -> You mean headless?

Line:38, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/439871_headless/439871.textile -> That's one of the end goals which are supported by other products. 

OffScreenEditPart* are here if we want pixel perfect export, exports as SVG are another options..

Line:97, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/439871_headless/439871.textile -> Indeed and no such dependencies should be added. Hence the need for an extension point in diagram so that diagram.ui can hook the canonical synchronizing.
