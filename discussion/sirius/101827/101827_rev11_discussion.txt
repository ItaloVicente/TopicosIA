Line:34, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.textile -> From a developper point of view, the representation is loaded when @DRepresentationDescriptor.getRepresentation()@ called.

Line:34, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.textile -> as soon as Sirius needs it to perform the functionality. For example: open an editor, copy, rename or delete a representation, export a diagram as image ...

Line:34, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.textile -> that

Line:35, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.textile -> * The Sirius API used to retrieve DRepresentation, such as DialectManager, keep the same behavior. New API (see below) has been added to retrieve loaded representation.
* Warning, if you used the Sirius crossReferencer before, it may not return the same result than before. It works on the scope of only what is loaded in the session. Before all the models was loaded whereas now some representation will not be. ECrossReferenceAdapter.getInverseReferences(EObject ) or ECrossReferenceAdapter.getInverseReferences(EObject , boolean) will not provide potential inverse references that would be in not loaded representation. The typical case is getting DRepresentationElement referencing a semantic element as DSemanticDecorator.target.

Line:35, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.textile -> IMO the release note - as we currently use it - is not the place for that. I move this paragraph in a specific developer documentation
