DESCRIPTION:

DRAFT - [570055] Avoid to adapt node label when it is on border

There is no reason to change the location and size of a label of this
last is on the border of the node.

DRAFT --> This commit also disables the constraint change when the
refreshFont method is called. I saw no reason to do it at this time. And
there was a mistake because with the previous code, an absolute location
is set as constraint instead of a relative location. This part is
considered as DRAFT waiting IC tests result. Indeed, it's difficult to
see the full impact of this change. Another option will be to set the
constraint but with an relative location
