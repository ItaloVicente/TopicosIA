DESCRIPTION:

[DRAFT 482528] Leave the SiriusToolsService loaded in the interpreter

This can provide a huge performance boost, as it prevents the
invalidation of the JavaExtensionManger instances (one for the
"service:" interpreter, one for the AQL interpreter) on each expression
evaluated from this SiriusInterpreter.

However it has the drawback of "polluting" the global namespace of
services available in the Sirius session with the ones provided by
SiriusToolServices. In theory this can cause name clashes and
unpredictable behaviors with signature-compatible services explicitly
provided by user VSMs.

From the services currently provided in SiriusToolsServices:

* eGet() and eSet() could (should?) probably be moved up into the
  "standard library of services", and documented so the users which may
  already have services named like this can adapt;

* most of the methods related to context handling have in their
  signatures "private" types which only exist in the oes.ui.properties
  plug-in, so leaving them in the global namespace is relatively safe,
  as long as all interpreters properly support polymorphism, which is
  currently not the case for ServiceInterpreter (but this can probably
  be fixed);

* the "SiriusContext context(EObject self)" service is problematic, as
  it is by design very generic (both in its signature and name).
  It *could* be replaced by an implicit variable of the same name
  automatically added by SiriusInterpreter. SiriusContext could be made
  lazy to offset the cost of computation of the variable's value (which
  would be set for all expression evaluations).

* the executeOperation() is not supposed to be invoked from
  user-supplied expressions, so we could "uglify" its name (e.g.
  "org_eclipse_sirius_ui_properties_internal_executeOperation") to
  reduce the risk of clashes with user-defined services.
