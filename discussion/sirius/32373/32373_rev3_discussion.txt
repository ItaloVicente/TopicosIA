Line:366, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release Notes.textile -> I think we could improve this to force the user to pay more attention that he has not just to rename the setText into setDefaultNewText but that he has also to move the call before the dialog creation

Line:367, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release Notes.textile -> At first glance I was not sure we need to mention that as the method "still exist" by inheritance but it is just the overriden implementation which has been removed.

But here we also change the contract of the method: the inherited setTitle method has to be called before the dialog create methods, because the value will be during the dialog creation.

Additional warning: the developper will not have any compilation error.

Line:366, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release Notes.textile -> The last precision has been added in order to the user pay more attention  on the fact that the call must be before the dialog creation.

Line:367, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release Notes.textile -> The new contract of the method has been clarified.
