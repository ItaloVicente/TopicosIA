DESCRIPTION:

[DRAFT] Adding support for literal/constant arguments to service:

I rejected the addition of literal (strings, numbers, boolean) arguments
to service: until now because the whole point of this interpreter is to
have a minimal runtime overhead, and adding more complex parsing code to
handle these new constructs would go against that. Except that maybe
this could be offset by caching a parsed version of the call instead of
re-doing the parsing on each invocation.

The current version does not change anything but give an idea of what
the cached structure could be. Note that it would also improve the
general case with no literals, as current we *do* parse the whole string
on each invocation anyway.

Final note: actual performance measures should be performed before
trying to implement this idea. In particular, with the recent addition
of AQL, the whole reason for service: to exist in the first place may be
gone.
