Some cleanup is required because it looks like you went for a complex solution with ToolbarActions supporting inheritance and then went back to an simpler solution (which I approve) but it has kept some design choices which are relevant only with a complex solution. Since multiple persons have worked on this review, I am not even sure that the "you" is the same in both case :D

I think that ToolbarAction should be handled like validation rules on groups and pages with changes on both of their preprocessors with minimal impact on other existing preprocessors and switches.

Two small other points:
- shouldn't we be able to filter toolbar actions on extended groups and pages too?
- as painful as it is, trust me I know :), we will need the properties view to edit the toolbar actions in the odesign. We have so much customization in the plugin.xml of the generated properties view that it's less painful to write it by hand for now, even if it hurts me -.-"
Line:59, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/api/PreconfiguredPreprocessor.java -> I would not modify this file since the issue of toolbar actions only appear for pages and groups and both already have a dedicated preprocessor in charge of specific issues (validation rules for example).

Line:70, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/api/PreconfiguredPreprocessorUtils.java -> We may need to change this to a method shouldCopy(featureType) because those four methods now seem a bit verbose. Yet I would not modify this file for the same reason as the previous one.

Line:287, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/internal/converter/PropertiesDescriptionConverterSwitch.java -> I am not sure that this is necessary

Line:66, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/internal/preprocessor/PageDescriptionPreprocessor.java -> Wouldn't it be easier to handle the toolbar actions directly like the validation rules? Why is the GroupDescriptionPreprocessor not modified in a similar fashion as the PageDescriptionPreprocessor?

Line:133, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/internal/preprocessor/PropertiesDescriptionPreprocessorSwitch.java -> There is no concept of inheritance for widget actions, do we even need this code? Do we need the concept of inheritance for ToolbarAction when it does not exist on widget actions?

File Comment: plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.edit/icons/full/obj16/ToolbarAction.gif -> It needs an icon especially so close from the Oxygen release, even if the icon is not the sexiest one ever :)
Line:435, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.edit/plugin.properties -> why? I don't see the those features in the ecore file.

Line:69, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.edit/plugin.xml -> To remove. The plugin.xml of org.eclipse.sirius.properties.edit should never change unless there is a very good reason :)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:59, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/api/PreconfiguredPreprocessor.java -> Done

Line:70, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/api/PreconfiguredPreprocessorUtils.java -> Done

Line:287, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/internal/converter/PropertiesDescriptionConverterSwitch.java -> It is.

Line:66, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/internal/preprocessor/PageDescriptionPreprocessor.java -> In fact it is well handled by the default preprocessor as the default behaviour is to convert the multi value references so nothing needs to be added in the page or group preprocessor.

Line:133, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.core/src/org/eclipse/sirius/properties/core/internal/preprocessor/PropertiesDescriptionPreprocessorSwitch.java -> The widget actions are not copied but converted as you need to set the SiriusInitialOperationAdapter in order to execute the action call. So I decided to implement the toolbar in the same way as it was done for the widget actions for consistency purpose.

File Comment: plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.edit/icons/full/obj16/ToolbarAction.gif -> Done
Line:435, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.edit/plugin.properties -> My bad this was due to a mix ;( 
I rebased the code on master in order to be on top of the extends/overides feature.

Line:69, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.edit/plugin.xml -> Done
