We will have to find a way to avoid conflict with other application.
For example we could have Capella which wuold provide its own filter and an extension of the application with other extension or an extension that would not want to have the extension activated.
At least the Toolfilter should not be added globally. We should ask the extention to give a ToolFilter and the associated meta-model it should apply on.

Can you elaborate? I don't understand.

I think that's what we want actually. Filters get the diagram passed as an argument so they can be implemented sensibly.
