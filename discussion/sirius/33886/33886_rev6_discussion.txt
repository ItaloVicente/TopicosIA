Patch Set 6: Code-Review-2

-2 for opening yet another public API with no actual concrete use case except "maybe someone, somewhere, sometimes, will need this, and it will avoid them writing 2 whole lines of code!"

Given the only two existing callers are in the same plug-in, this can be kept internal.

If you believe such an API has a real need for external clients, provide a use case and then we can discuss this separately. As it is, even though I'm fine with the technical change itself I have to vote -2 because your patch conflates a fix I'm fine with with something else entirely with which I disagree.

As a general rule, please try to isolate actual fixes from related but not strictly needed changes/improvements. This way the fix itself is easier to review, has less chance to be blocked/delayed from merging for unrelated reasons, and the improvement proposal can be discussed and possibly refined separately.
Line:2, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/query/DSemanticDecoratorQuery.java -> Not 100% sure, but I believe this should be © Obeo, as the original bugzilla was reported by Alex, and apparently not in the context of a client-sponsored issue.

Line:39, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/query/DSemanticDecoratorQuery.java -> Nitpick: creating a local for this seems overkill.
