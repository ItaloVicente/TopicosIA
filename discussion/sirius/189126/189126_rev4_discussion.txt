DESCRIPTION:

[575196] Reorganize the Sirius constraints in Preferences

The Sirius constraints are now clearly categorized in the preferences.
The categories have been defined in oe.sirius plugin (even table,
diagram and sequence) because otherwise the sirius main categories
should be redefined in every plugins (with potential mistakes).

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

I am not sure to see the benefit of this commit. What was the issue with having plugins adding their own categories? It seems to be going the opposite way from the modular purpose of plugins.

For example, until this fix all diagram and sequence diagram constraints were put in the Sequence diagram category because the sequence plugin is loaded after diagmra plugin so it overrides the category

But the real interest of this commit is to cleary understand which category correspond to what (i was forced to explore the code to understand) and prepare the following commit in which there will a new image constraint
