DESCRIPTION:

[425561] Wire a DanglingRefRemoval trigger

With this commit removing dangling reference does not need
to be explicit anymore and always use the special logic needed
for some references.

The dangling reference to ignore predicates have been moved to the
DanglingRefRemovalTrigger and reused in the other classes.

An additional method has been added in RemoveDanglingReferences to
manage the resource case.

Mostly OK, but a few minor things I'd like changed.
Line:2, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/helper/task/AbstractDeleteDRepresentationElementTask.java -> Maybe add "and others" to all files which were significantly modified by this issue.

Line:439, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DAnalysisSessionImpl.java -> Am I missing something or is there no symetrical "disposLocalTriggers()" on session close?

Line:52, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> These 2 predicates look generic enough that they could/should be in org.eclipse.sirius.ext.emf.

Line:100, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> We should not rely on Java reflection, (java.lang.Class#isAssignableFrom), but on EMF reflection instead, with something like:

ViewpointPackage.Literals.DSEMANTIC_DECORATOR.isSuperTypeOf(reference.getEContainingClass() )

This will work even with a dynamic EMF model.

Line:152, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> This is a dependency from core to diagram. It is bypassed using a String, but still the dependency is here. Do you know if this was handled as part of the split (bug #427803)? More generally, the current design for this DanglingRefRemovalTrigger is not extensible; the implementation has to know about all potential special cases in every dialects. This is probably out of scope for this particular ticket but maybe we should open another ticket for this.

Line:2, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/helper/task/AbstractDeleteDRepresentationElementTask.java -> The only significant changes are in DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java which has been in this for this issue and has the EPL Copyright (c) 2014 Obeo.

Line:439, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DAnalysisSessionImpl.java -> See the close() method:
// TODO deinitialize model accessor, authority.. 	      
 // dispose the SessionEventBroker 	
 if (broker != null) {	      
   broker.dipose()
}

Line:52, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> They look generic enough but they are internal, 'young' and for the moment only used here, so I think we should externalize them in org.eclipse.sirius.ext.emf later.

Line:100, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> Done

Line:152, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> I will open a ticket, it will be done after the 'split' Diagram/Core.
