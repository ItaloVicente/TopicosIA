Line:40, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/518136_RemoveBendpoints/518136_RemoveBendpoints.textile -> The first and last segment must target the center of the source and target nodes (and not the intersection point of first step).

To be more clear the "Before remove bend-points" image must show an edge that does not target the center.

You must also explain that the second segment is on the middle of first point and last point.
