DESCRIPTION:

[470141] Add adapters on new referenced analysis after reload

Add adapters on new referenced analysis after reload. 

Control the order of the workspace impacting notifications to place the
representation files changes after the semantic files changes. The
previous order was the folder/project children resources order (by
name), it used to forbid the controlled resource detection after an
external control.
