DESCRIPTION:

[DRAFT 441666] Remove the old 'Model Request Interpreter' view

This is currently just a draft, whose main purpose is to clearly
identify which code we're talking about. A quick glance on the code
does not reveal other code that could be removed (but I may have
missed some). A pity, I hoped it would drag more "dead weight" with
it... The positive side is that it seems pretty well isolated, and if
someone really really wanted to keep using that version, it should be
easy enough to copy that code.

As it is, we can not proceed with the removal until we've made sure
the "Interpeter" view provided by Acceleo can be installed without
pulling other parts of Acceleo. And then of course if we implement the
removal it will need to be properly documented.
