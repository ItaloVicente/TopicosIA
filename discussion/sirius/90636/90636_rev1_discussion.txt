[511890] Add extension point to contribute Resource Sync Backends

Adds a new extension point in o.e.s.common so that other plugins can
contribute other AbstractResourceSyncBackend by defaults. 

This commit also change the registration WorkspaceBackend as a default
backend by using this extension point instead of directly instantiating
the class.

Some techinal/trivial remarks, but mostly what worries me a little is that this introduces the possibility for multiple backends to notify the ResourceSyncClient:
1. possibly in parallel (not sure ResourceSyncClient is thread-safe);
2. possibly from the UI thread (not a good idea, but as long as we open the door for arbitrary backends, we should be ready for this). Currently the EditingSessionWorkspaceListener used by the WorkspaceBackend is triggerd in a WorkerThread;
3. possibly multiple times for the same resource. Each backend is installed on the whole ResourceSet and has now way to know about/coordinate with other backends. If two or more try to handle the state of a specific Resource, possibly with inconsistent rules, it could lead to a mess.

For points 1 & 2, maybe the mechanism used by ResourceSyncClientNotifier (or something like it) should be lifted up into ResourceSyncClient directly.

For point 3, maybe I'm paranoid and this is only a theoretical issue that will never happen in practice. In the example attached to the bugzilla though, the code is careful to check:

   if (r.getURI() != null && MyProtocolResourceFactory.PROTOCOL_PREFIX.equals(r.getURI().scheme())) {

In a more open setting, I'm not sure it's wise to assume all backend implementers will have the proper checks and they will all be mutually exclusive.

That said, if these issues can be overcome (or prove to be non-issues), I'm all for the general idea of opening such an extension point.
