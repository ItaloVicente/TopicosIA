Line:69, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor.diagram/src/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/editor/tools/internal/menu/initializer/InitializerOpenWizardAction.java -> You should extends StaticSelectionCommand.

If user clic on cancel, you currently call result.execute() -> NPE. 

You can't direcltly execute the command. See in the classes I have referenced in previous patch sets comments how to execute the command on the command stack.

Line:91, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor.diagram/src/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/editor/tools/internal/menu/initializer/InitializerOpenWizardAction.java -> Where do you use this ? 
The current action is not aware of your different patterns. And you can't create your command without knowing the user choices.

Line:73, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor.diagram/src/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/editor/tools/internal/menu/initializer/InitializerWizardSelectionPage.java -> You should not build the combo from the commands. You should configure the next page from the selected pattern and you will build a pattern specific command from its configuration wizard page when the user clic on finish.

I understand your comments Maxime Porhel, on "Combo" we need to add elements, from where we will get this ones? (I know we need to create the command just after click on finish otherwise it will create a UnexecutableCommand)

Should I create a static int variables to identify any element on Combo?

I have created a default list in action of command to get the ResourceSet and configure it with a method for the configuration single or multiple tools inside the command

Hi João, we have already discussed about that combo/wizard/command population. 

We spoke about something like a IPatterProvider, an interface defining several method like getId, getPatternName, getPatternConfigurationWizard (and maybe getCommand, but this could be computed/built/instanciated from a service on a IPatternConfigurationWizardPage). 
The wizard could get a list of available pattern from an extension point (next step), now you could just populate a list of available pattern with an implementation of IPatternProvider for your current pattern: a ClassDiagramPatternProvider. Then the wizard combo iterates over the available pattern provider list and display their labels. When the user clic on the next button, it displays the selected provider's getPatternWizardConfPage and when he clicks on finish it asks the conf page to create the corresponding command.

Currently you did not create the extension point yet, so you have to "manually" add your diagram pattern to the available patterns during wizard creation/initialisation. Then you will replace this add by a proper look for extensionw to your extension point.

Ok, I think I have understand that Maxime, In wizard to get a event the only way is to configure for example the button with a "addListener" or we can get the events from other way?

I think you have to use listeners to set the next page when the suer has selected a pattern. You should look into the existing wizard and wizard pages, and in tuto like http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseWizards/article.html ( you hve to use the right listener on the combo, to set the next page and enable the next button)
