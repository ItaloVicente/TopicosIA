DESCRIPTION:

[576423] Remove resizing with default dimension for WorkspaceImage

* The size of the GMF nodes with a WorkspaceImage should not be set to a
default value (real image size). The size of these nodes is now computed
and set like the others.
* WorkspaceImageQuery has been completed to handle all cases (for
example, it is now also used in
org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.business.internal.query.DNodeQuery.getDefaultDimension()).
* A migration participant has been added to recompute the size of the
GMF nodes according to their "Workspace Image style description" and
Sirius node size.

This commit also adds tests:
* One with a fixed size (an integer as Size Computation Expression), and
another one with an aql Size Computation Expression.
* Actor.png has been resized to have a "precise" ratio between width and
height (height=2*width).

I've updated your last patch set to:
* improve tests to 
    * also have a case with a real expression (and not simply a "simple integer" case)
    * check behavior with an image without 1 as ratio (ie width != height) --> the fix was wrong for this case when the expression is not a simple integer.
* fix the problem detected.

I'm always doubtful about the migration participant (different treatment between "simple integer" and expression). Why not always consider the size of the DDiagramElement instead of trying to recompute it from the expression of the odesign file (only in some case) ?
