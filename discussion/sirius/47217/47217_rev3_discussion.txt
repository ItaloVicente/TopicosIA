DESCRIPTION:

[466455] Replace RefreshIDFactory static calls with a scoped holder

Now that MinimalEObjectImpl is being used for Sirius's model the
approach of attaching IDs to every EObject through eAdapters() became
more CPU intensive than desired representing 17 to 18% of the time spent
refreshing a diagram (You can check the logic in
org.eclipse.emf.ecore.impl.MinimalEObjectImpl.eAdapters()) 

This commit changes this approach by introducing a non-static holder for
such IDs which is scoped to a given representation (RefreshIdsHolder).
The holder itself still is an adapter and clear its state when its being
detached from the representation (on Resource.unload for instance).

This commit changes both the Diagram and Table algorithms which were
making use of the RefreshIDFactory.

Notable change of this (besides some API) is that a RefreshID is now
unique only in the scope of given representation - which can actually be
expected from its name.

To check: I think the eDelete might clean the eAdapters list, causing the refresh id adapter to dispose the id but I am not sure.

Line:119, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/tools/api/command/view/CreateDDiagramElementCommand.java -> Why do you create this here ? 
The node candidate will never be null, and if the command was created with the edge constructor, it will never execute the edgeCandidate case see l127 and 129

Line:100, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/tools/api/command/view/CreateDDiagramElementCommand.java -> getparentDiagram() will be null.. you have to set the container before calling the method.

Line:1373, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/internal/experimental/sync/DDiagramSynchronizer.java -> It looks like eDelete is not clearing the adapter lists. It's probably better (as in more consistent with the previous approach) not to do it as otherwise objects will change their Refresh IDs when undoing a deletion for instance.
