DESCRIPTION:

[490594] Improve packaging of the properties view support

- Replace the monolithic oes.incubation.properties feature with two
  finer-grained ones, isolating the specification environment support
  from the runtime.

  Despite the incubation status of the work, the new features' names do
  not include an "incubation" segment to avoid breaking updates when
  this becomes ready for prime time.

- Fix the various plug-ins packaging: add missing files and copyright
  information, update version to 4.0.0 to match the rest of Sirius (even
  though this particular component is new and still in incubation), make
  sure build.properties & co. are correct, etc.

- Also fix the samples projects (which had inconsistent Java package
  names and mostly missing or incorrect metadata due to quick
  copy/pasting) and add all of them to the build via a new feature.
