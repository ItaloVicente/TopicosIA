DESCRIPTION:

[574273] Add z-order actions on edges

* The actions are provided with Eclipse menu extension points (to allow
shortcuts easily).
* Actions are "disabled" for sequence diagram.

For information, even if actions are only for edges, the API added in
IDiagramCommandFactory also handle the nodes cases (code copied from
GMF). This behavior is not used currently but maybe in another
improvement to homogenize the behavior between nodes and edges (shortcut
for example).

Some explanations about the changes of this commit:
* All classes in org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.tools.api.command are the
code for the commands finally executed and who change the model.
* The changes in sequence.ui plugin are only little changes to have no
effect on sequence diagrams with the new actions.
* The changes in
org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.tools.internal.actions.layout and
org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.tools.internal.commands are to manage the
actions available in contextual menus.
* The changes in
org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.edit.api.part.AbstractDDiagramEditPart are
to reorder the edges figures according to GMF order (to reflect the
changes done by the actions/commands on the figure).

The change in
org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.edit.api.part.AbstractDDiagramEditPart.refreshChildren()
has probably a "performance" impact because we redraw the edge figure in
a "new order". This performance is "not significant" because this method
is called in specific conditions:
* org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.edit.api.part.AbstractDDiagramEditPart.handleNotificationEvent(Notification)
calls refreshChildren() when
    * VIEW__PERSISTED_CHILDREN or VIEW__TRANSIENT_CHILDREN is changed
    * a NoteAttachment is removed
    * activatedFilters is changed
    * activatedLayers or activatedTransientLayers is changed
    * when the diagram is notified of a set, a unset or an add
notification
    * on a visibility change on a GMF view
    * on a change of order of GMF edges
* after these actions
    * creation of a new element at the root of the diagram (edge, node,
container, note, note attachment)
	* external save on VSM or semantic resource (reload of the session and
refresh of the diagram)
* not on these actions
    * Move of a node/container
	* Move of an edge
	* Reconnect of an edge
	* Creation of a new element inside a container

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> If it is disabled, couldn't we remove the contextual action then? Here they are available but with no effect indeed.

Line:61, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/plugin.properties -> not sure if we should keep the first letter in capital case here, but looking at the other menu...there's not really a rule here, we are not homogenous 😞

Line:1131, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/plugin.xml -> copy/paste mistake I guess. it should be bringForward

Line:1135, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/plugin.xml -> same but bringBackward here

Line:1495, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/plugin.xml -> I may be wrong but couldn't we had a check that if the user selected one edge, we could compute if there is no corssing edge in front of it, and thus, disabling the action on that case? (same remark for the other contextual action)

Line:211, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/actions/layout/AbstractEdgesZOrderAction.java -> It's a detail but why adding the tag <code> here? While overring the javadoc it just change the style. I think it is more the word "connection" on the description of the @param connectionsToIgnore that would need to reference this parameter.

Line:215, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/actions/layout/AbstractEdgesZOrderAction.java -> the "connection" word that I was talking about. It is not explicit that it is talking of the variable but otherwise it would miss a "the".
Then again that's a detail, but I don't think the javadoc can add links between parameters unfortunately

Line:24, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/actions/layout/BringToFrontAction.java -> the front (note: on the contextual action itself we can ignore the missing "the" I guess, as we do on other actions)

Line:280, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/plugin.properties -> I am not sure but it feels strange. I would change it to "All elements do not have the same parent." (or "Not all elements have the same parent" depending on the context, but I prefer the first one)

Line:281, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/plugin.properties -> ditto

Line:163, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/tools/api/command/view/AbstractZOrderRecordingCommand.java -> remove commented code :)

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> No, unfortunately, it is not possible. The menus are added with "org.eclipse.ui.menus" extension point for all "IDiagramEdgeEditPart", and SequenceMessageEditPart implements IDiagramEdgeEditPart.
Nevertheless, I will add a dialog to inform end-user why nothing has been executed (in a new gerrit).

Line:61, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/plugin.properties -> I reuse the same as menus already available for nodes (provided by GMF)

Line:1131, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:1135, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/plugin.xml -> Done

Line:1495, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/plugin.xml -> In theory yes. But this implies to compute this for each contextual menu, even if the user do not want to change the z-order of edges. For performance reason, in other case, it has been decided to always have the menu and compute the "conditions" only when the actino is really executed. I chose this approach.
