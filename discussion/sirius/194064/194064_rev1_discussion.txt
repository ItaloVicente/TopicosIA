DESCRIPTION:

[test] Fix BorderedNodeCreation tests on IC server

Since the migration of an IC server, some tests about border node
creation fail. The creation location was not the expected one. This was
caused by an existing label that was not located on the same place
before the border node creation. On IC server, the expected location of
the new border node was in conflict with the label of the parent. The
font size is the problem (not the same on this server). Locally, the
label's bounds is {266.0, 19.0, 52.0, 16.0}, on the IC server was
{262.0, 19.0, 56.0, 16.0}.

To avoid this problem, the data has been changed to rename the label Cl4
instead of Class4 and to move slightly the label, to no longer be in
conflict with the expected creation location.

Even if there are a lot of change in aird file only the name and the
location have been changed. The rest is caused by the data migration.

Abandoned

These problems no longer exits with the MS Fonts installed on the corresponding IC server. So this gerrit is abandoned.
