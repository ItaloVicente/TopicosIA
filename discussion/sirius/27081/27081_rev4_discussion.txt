DESCRIPTION:

[435363] Correclty use groups in the edit menu

The Copy/PasteLayoutAction are now in the copyLayoutGroup, it was
created before, but actions were added to the copyGroup (for the
contextual menu, ok pour the action bars). 

The delete from diagram was wrongly added in additions before this
copyLayoutGroup, the delete from model was added after the copy layout
group separator. 

Now a deleteFromGroup separator has been added to regroup the two delete
from actions.

OK. The patch needs to be rebased, so if you can fix the typo in the commit message as part of the rebase... but that's not enough to block merging.
