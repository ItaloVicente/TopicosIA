Laurent, I found some lost @not-generated and other issue. 
See each comment.
Line:219, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/plugin.xml -> Before the split, the concern extension was manually removed. 
Now it has been moved as child of the diagram/description package but it should still be manually removed.

Line:117, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/description/contribution/provider/DirectEObjectReferenceItemProvider.java -> Our formatter should keep this empty line.

Line:336, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/description/style/provider/NodeStyleDescriptionItemProvider.java -> Lost not-generated overriden method.

File Comment: plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/style/provider/RoundedCornerStyleDescriptionItemProvider.java -> This class should have been removed during style split. It has been copied/moved into diagram/description/style/provider but not deleted.
Line:140, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/provider/SwitchChildItemProvider.java -> It was a  @not-generated method.This was done to create the default case in the switch.

See differences with collectNewChildDescriptorsGen.

Line:259, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/impl/DDiagramElementImpl.java -> This should be for  "* @not-generated (for CDO native compatibility reason)"

Line:234, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/impl/ToolFactoryImpl.java -> Lost @not-generated code.

Line:243, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/impl/ToolFactoryImpl.java -> Lost @not-generated code.

Line:253, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/impl/ToolFactoryImpl.java -> Lost @not-generated code.

Line:263, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/impl/ToolFactoryImpl.java -> Lost @not-generated code.

Line:273, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/impl/ToolFactoryImpl.java -> Lost @not-generated code.

Line:294, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/impl/ToolFactoryImpl.java -> Lost @not-generated code.

Line:434, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/tool/impl/ToolFactoryImpl.java -> Lost @not-generated. 
"{0}" should maybe be the default value in the viewpoint.ecore.

Line:57, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/DiagramSplitMigrationParticipant.java -> I wonder wether we should use the fully qualified names in type = XxxPackage.eInstance.getEClassifier(name)

Line:31, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/NsURIMigrationParticipant.java -> We should use the same pattern for filter, validation and concern packages which have been moved to diagram/description.

Line:53, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/NsURIMigrationParticipant.java -> We should use the same pattern for filter, validation and concern packages which have been moved to diagram/description.

We could put regroup the 3 sirius to sirius moves at the end off this map initialization.

Line:78, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/NsURIMigrationParticipant.java -> We should use the same pattern for filter, validation and concern packages which have been moved to diagram/description.

Line:218, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/validation/description/constraints/ExistingExpressionVariablesConstraint.java -> It seems this method should use the new DiagramToolSwitchValidator too.

Line:53, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/NsURIMigrationParticipant.java -> The two sirius to sirius cases here, are not really needed, it concern manually rebranded models (our test cases). 
It should be done in this commit (I have a temporary local commit with the same put for the filter package case, but I did not submit it for the moment as it should not be required.

Line:78, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/NsURIMigrationParticipant.java -> The migration Sirius 0.9 to Sirius 1.0 is not handled for concern and validation moves.
