Line:48, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.services.graphql/src/org/eclipse/sirius/services/graphql/internal/schema/mutation/resources/SiriusGraphQLCreateSemanticFileField.java -> Note sure we should talk about "files" here, instead of the more generic/abstract "model" (which would still be true even if we decide to store model in a different way on the server).

Line:40, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.services.graphql/src/org/eclipse/sirius/services/graphql/internal/schema/mutation/resources/SiriusGraphQLCreateTextFileField.java -> Why text files in particular instead of generic blobs? The code itself  does not seem to care.

Line:105, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.services.graphql/src/org/eclipse/sirius/services/graphql/internal/schema/mutation/resources/SiriusGraphQLCreateTextFileField.java -> Shouldn't this low-level file handling stuff go into SiriusGraphQLFileCreationHelper?

Line:48, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.services.graphql/src/org/eclipse/sirius/services/graphql/internal/schema/mutation/resources/SiriusGraphQLCreateSemanticFileField.java -> I used to term file here because the result of this operation is visible as a File in the GraphQL API. I found it odd to have a mutation to create a model if they are no model concepts in the rest of the API. All resources are files, some of them have a semantic data structure on top of a text content, some don't.

There two kinds of files that can be created, semantic files and text files. Both are stored in a similar fashion and I don't make any hypothesis on a specific kind of file containing EObjects or not but I have two different entry points since I will need to initialize some files with a piece of text and other with an empty EObject.

Line:40, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.services.graphql/src/org/eclipse/sirius/services/graphql/internal/schema/mutation/resources/SiriusGraphQLCreateTextFileField.java -> The code is expecting a string as the content, sure this string could contain any piece of content

Line:105, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.services.graphql/src/org/eclipse/sirius/services/graphql/internal/schema/mutation/resources/SiriusGraphQLCreateTextFileField.java -> I have only put in SiriusGraphQLFileCreationHelper the common code between semantic and text files.
