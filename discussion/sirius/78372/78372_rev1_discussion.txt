Line:1, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/archived/498869_edgeAndPortsCompoundMoves_multiSelection/498869.textile -> This specification must be first in draft or proposal folder (not directly in archived folder). This change the ref to other spec with addition of '../archived/'

Line:5, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/archived/498869_edgeAndPortsCompoundMoves_multiSelection/498869.textile -> It is not clear. This evolution is for "selection of edges"???

Line:17, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/archived/498869_edgeAndPortsCompoundMoves_multiSelection/498869.textile -> You can also add a reference to the end-user documentation.

Line:29, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/archived/498869_edgeAndPortsCompoundMoves_multiSelection/498869.textile -> ** every selected element must be an edge with border nodes as source and target

Line:30, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/archived/498869_edgeAndPortsCompoundMoves_multiSelection/498869.textile -> This is not really a requirement. This is more a detail (to isolate as such).

Line:72, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/archived/498869_edgeAndPortsCompoundMoves_multiSelection/498869.textile -> ** Test move with selection containing a node (no move)

Line:29, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/archived/498869_edgeAndPortsCompoundMoves_multiSelection/498869.textile -> This is one of the role for a single edge move. I have described a little more what I wanted to say.
