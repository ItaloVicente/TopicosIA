DESCRIPTION:

[576305] Tests about wrong regions size with multiple regions containers

This commit adds specific tests with a VStack container containing
HStack containers, themselves containing lists.
These kind of problems have been detected with the usage "Title Block"
into Capella.
As reminder, assembling multiple region containers is not supported.
The goal of this issue is, at least, to improve "Title Block" case.

Line:936, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/diagram/compartment/CompartmentsLayoutTest.java -> I am not sure where this "- 4" comes from. A border that reduces the bounds? A factor to think about when dealing with compartement? Is this a value we can get from odesign or a constant in Sirius?

Line:1595, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> on this check there are several "expectedDraw2DListDimension.height() + someValue". Is it expected or is a difference between gmf and draw2d that we don't really understand where it is comming from but is consistent so we can ignore?

Line:1641, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> I have not seen this //TODO implemented in further commits. Was it forgotten or is it a reminder for later that can be skipped here?

Line:1736, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> You can have the same result with "editor.getSWTBotGefViewer().mainEditPart().children()"

Line:1739, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> Maybe you can extract this as a constant "heightResize" or "boundsResize" so it is easier to track further down.

Line:1868, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> Do you really need to save twice?

Line:1909, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> Same here, I tend to extract the move value as a local variable so it is easier to track in the assert further down, but it might just be me.

Line:1929, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> Another //TODO that remained

Line:1969, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> another double save

Line:1993, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> ditto

Line:2030, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> ditto

Line:936, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/diagram/compartment/CompartmentsLayoutTest.java -> It is the "borders width". I have extracted a local variable to be a little more explicit. It is a kind of magic number.

Line:1595, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> I have added some "TODO". I have currently to "real" explanation, but this is not the goal of this test and of this issue.

Line:1641, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> It is a reminder for later. There are a lot of problems not resolved yet. These TODOs are here to initialize a future further analysis. This is not the goal of this issue.

Line:1736, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> +1 ;)

Line:1739, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> Done

Line:1868, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> No

Line:1909, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> Done

Line:1929, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> Same answer that before, it is another scenario to analyse later

Line:1969, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> Done

Line:1993, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/compartment/CompartmentsTest.java -> Done
