DESCRIPTION:

[regen] Re-generate all the metamodels' code

Re-generate all the code of our metamodels (except for the VSM
editor's properties view) using Oxygen.3, i.e. EMF 2.13. Most of the
changes are formatting-only, but there are a few actual changes, which
should have been part of previous regenerations but were missed:
* DRepresentation.uid (introduced in #516669): was not regenerated for
  sequences, tables and trees.
* DDiagram.backgroundColor (introduced in #525533): was not
  regenerated for sequence.
* DDiagram.isInShowingMode (introduced in #527109): was not
  regenerated.

is it not the right moment to update copyrights to 2018?
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> from my understanding the missed changes should be part of the regen. But they are not.

I would propose to clarify:
" Most of the
changes are formatting-only, but there are a few actual changes, which
should have been part of previous regenerations but were missed that have not been regenerated:"

Line:70, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.edit/plugin.xml -> is it normal to have this addition?

Line:70, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.edit/plugin.xml -> No, I regenerated so many times to get the Java code right that I forgot to revert this part.

Line:137, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/description/SelectionDescription.java -> My interpretation is that this is normal and part of a change in EMF's generator, notably https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=494338.
