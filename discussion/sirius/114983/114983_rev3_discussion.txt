DESCRIPTION:

[529148] Add action to add vertical space in sequence diagram

With this commit, it is now possible to add vertical space in sequence
diagram by using a drag'n'drop in the ruler grid with Ctrl key pressed.

In future, to allow add of horizontal space in sequence diagram and,
vertical and horizontal space in standard diagram, the methods
SequenceEMFCommandFactory.buildAddHorizontalSpaceCommand(DDiagram, int,
int)
UndoRedoCapableEMFCommandFactory.buildAddVerticalSpaceCommand(DDiagram,
int, int),
UndoRedoCapableEMFCommandFactory.buildAddHorizontalSpaceCommand(DDiagram,
int, int) will have to be implemented.

This commit uses a new SiriusRulerComposite to have a specific
RulerEditPartFactory to instantiate a specific SiriusRulerEditPart to
finally enable a specific SimpleDragTracker when Ctrl key is pressed.
This SimpleDragTracker, SiriusRulerDragTracker, draws the feedback and
executes the command returned by the SiriusRulerEditPart.
The SiriusRulerEditPart delegates the creation of the command to
IDiagramCommandFactory.
Currently, only addition of vertical space in sequence diagram is
implemented.
