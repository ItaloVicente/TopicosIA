DESCRIPTION:

[DRAFT 494611] Avoid CNFE storms on startup

Avoid static access to Messages classes (which require the bundle to be
activated to initialized properly) from the activator classes
themselves.

This caused a situation where to initialize some Sirius class (for
example one registers on a platform extension point):

1. OSGi instanciates the corresponding Sirius activator class (for
   example DslCommonPlugin$Implementation). To do this it needs to
   initialize its static fields/execute its static blocks.

2. If such a static initialization accesses the bundle's Messages class,
   Messages itself needs to be loaded and initialized first.

3. The (static) initialization of the Messages class ends-up calling
   EMF's DelegatingResourceLocator.getString(). getString() calls
   getPrimaryResourceLocator(), which calls getPluginResourceLocator(),
   which returns the value of the "plugin" static field. It is null at
   this point because we are still in the process of creating the
   instance of DslCommonPlugin$Implementation (step 1 above) that will
   be its value later.

4. Seeing no ResourceLocator, EMF's DelegatingResourceLocator assumes
   we're in a non-OSGi context and falls back to a costly strategy of
   invoking Java's ResourceResourceBundle.getBundle(packageName +
   ".plugin"), which will ask all the accessible ClasLoaders for the
   named resource.

5. Of course they will all fail, throwing a MissingResourceException.
   DelegatingResourceLocator tries a last-chance method of looking for a
   "plugin.properties" file at the base URL of the plug-in. As it
   happens, this matches the location of our properties, so in the end
   we get the correct value. Note that here EMF hard-codes the name and
   path of the properties file. If we had put them somewhere else (and
   mentioned it in the MANIFEST.MF's Bundle-Localization header), this
   heuristic would not find them (but OSGi/Equinox would).

For now two cases have been identified, as mentioned in
http://eclip.se/494611#c3, both treated in this patch:

- SiriusPlugin.INTER_REGISTRY: a private static final field, which is
  not non-static and non-final, initialized only in the activator's
  start() method.
- DslCommonPlugin.PROFILER: creates an instant of TimeProfiler2 which
  ends-up accessing Messages to get some of its strings. This one is
  public, so instead of breaking the API this late, we simply inline the
  string's default values for the few messages concerned. This means
  they are no longer translatable, but has very little impact in
  practice for name of columns or error messages related to the Sirius
  profiler.

What's left to do:
- Identify other possible cases in other activators, and treat them if
  possible.
- Understand why on most systems the thousands of CNFEs thrown on Sirius
  startup do not cause a significant slowdown, but on at least one (the
  reporter's), the slowdown is catatrophic.
