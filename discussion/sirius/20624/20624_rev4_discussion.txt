DESCRIPTION:

[426687] Optimize session's modification tracking

This replaces the current, costly setTrackingModification(true) with a
more efficient ModelChangeTrigger.

Sirius is forcing the usage of setTrackingModification on the resources.
It is using the isModified information to know if the session is in
sync. We are using this information to know whether the session is dirty
or not, and we know some adopters are using this information too. Not
having this boolean value anymore is not something we can target now.
But, we can avoid installing "yet another adapter" by replacing this
with a ModelChangeTrigger (which will be called by our "mighty
adapter").

This speeds up the Session opening and avoid filling the eAdapters()
list with on more adapter, and we often loop over this one for finding a
specific type instance.

Furthermore this make this choice, of having the modification tracking
enabled, a bit more configurable.

At last but not least, if our "mightly adapter" gets lazy, that's one
less step to do.

Please note that GMFResource forces the setTrackingModification itself
leading to .aird resources always having one anyway.

This commit introduces an API break in DAnalysisSessionImpl with a
protected method which disappeared.

I have not actually tested the change, but still have a few remarks (see my comments on the commit message).
Line:23, /COMMIT_MSG -> One impact I see is that the old ModificationTrackingAdapter, being a standard EMF adapter, reacted immediatly to any change in the model. The new version only updates the "modified" status at the end of a transaction.

This means that before, we could have a scenario where we start from a clean session, execute a command which changes the model, mark the session dirty immediatly on the first change and continue execution the command. After the first model change, the rest of the code in the command which asked the state of the session saw it dirty. With the new code, "dirtyness" is only updated at the end. This could possibly break existing code which relied on the old behavior (but it will be hard to identify such code).

Line:32, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is done in GMFResource, constructor, but at this time the Java instance is just created and the resource has no content yet. We use AirDResourceImpl which inherits from GMFResource, so if we want and validate it has no negative impact, we could setTrackingModification(false) in our own constructor, and no actual EObject inside the ressource would ever get the adapter.

Line:455, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DAnalysisSessionImpl.java -> In https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/20571, I created an initLocalTriggers method to allow other implementation of Session, subclasses of DAnalysisSessionImpl to configure this behavior if required.
