DESCRIPTION:

[427803] Generate edit plugin - 2

The commits "Generate edit plugin - *" concern changes in
rg.eclipse.sirius.ui and org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui corresponding to
the edit regen (and the corresponding refactoring in these plugins).

It also contains the changes caused by the refactoring of the previous
ommit (model regen)

1 other commit follows with the editor generation (and orresponding
refactoring).
Te compilation is not OK. That's normal. The most difficult cases will
be dealt later, one by one.

After discussion, it is more simpler to move all classes from
/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src to /org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src.
Indeed, originally, the plugin org.eclipse.sirius.diagram has for ui
aspects. So to have a result more quickly, it was decided to move all
these classes. There will be probably another step to isolate more
precisely some classes that could go again in
org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.

The commit "Generate edit plugin - 2" contains all changes for this
"step".
