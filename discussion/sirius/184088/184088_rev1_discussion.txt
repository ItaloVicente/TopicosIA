DESCRIPTION:

[cleanup] Correctly clean listener of AbstractOperationCondition

There was a "memory leak" in AbstractOperationCondition if the condition
fails. Indeed, in this case, the added operation history listener was
never removed.

It seems really strange/wrong to rely on a "getFailureMessage" method, whose job is to return a message (something one would expect to be side-effect free) to perform cleanup.

I agree with you. But I saw no "clean way" to do that. I will search a better way.

The only other way, that I imagine, is to add an explicit method "cleanUpOperationHistoryListener()" and that each user of these conditions must explicitly calls this method.
Is it better for you?

I could not find a better way either. Let's stay with your initial workaround.
