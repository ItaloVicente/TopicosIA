Line:102, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot.support/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/support/api/condition/CheckSelectedCondition.java -> Introducing a local variable for this is not justified.

Line:33, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot.support/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/support/api/condition/CompoundCondition.java -> This comment was probably copied from CheckSelectionCondition but is invalid here.

Line:71, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot.support/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/support/api/condition/CompoundCondition.java -> The early "return false" in test() at the first failure means okCondition will not contain all the passing conditions, so the message computed here is at least not as accurate as it could be, and maybe erroneous.

Testing all the conditions to get a complete/accurate message may be more costly, so to options I see:
1. the failure message is reworded to make it clear it provides only partial information.
2. test() is changed to always test every condition and keep a complete record of which passed or failed. This would mean catching exceptions which currently abort the test() method early.
3. support both modes with a flag on CompoundCondition so users can decide if they want accuracy or speed.

Line:102, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot.support/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/support/api/condition/CheckSelectedCondition.java -> I cleaned the other methods but I forgot this one. Will be done in next patch set.

Line:71, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot.support/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/support/api/condition/CompoundCondition.java -> I have changed the test method to have known the subConditions which fail.
