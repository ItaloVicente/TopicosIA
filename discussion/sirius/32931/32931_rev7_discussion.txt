DESCRIPTION:

[DRAFT 443950] Compute the representations to export only when invoked

Marked as DRAFT because of the following issue:

Since the computation of the representations is only done at execution,
isEnabled() does not have access to the info, and thus always return
true. Thus the action always appear as enabled in the context menu. This
is a change that should be discussed with users (or at least advertised
in the release notes if we go with it).

Related to this, when the user invokes the action but no representation
is found to export, there is currently no feedback at all. There should
be a popup explaining that no exportable representation were found.
However it is not trivial because the ExportAsRepresentationAction
inherits from an abstract class which is used in other context, so the
message should not pollute the other use cases (or be generic yet
precise enough to work for all cases).
