DESCRIPTION:

[443286] Install the AirdCrossReferenceAdapter after the domain creation

Move the AirdCrossReferenceAdapterImpl after the domain creation.

In Bug 437646, AirdDCrossReferencerAdapter installation has been moved
in the session factory and a common adapter is installed on the resource
set (we add previously on adapter per aird and only on AirdResourceImpl
see Bug 437646). 

It was done juste after the resource set creation (by resource set
factory which uses the first found extension) but just after the add of
the adapter, we create the editing domain: we call the
EditingDomainInFactoryService, which looks in the extension the 'first
most overrider' factory and create an editing domain. The creation has
the previously created set, but the created editing domain can use its
own resource set. 

Our adapter installation was done too soon. This typically occurs with
Capella which does not use one editing domain per session, but has its
own shared editing domain.
