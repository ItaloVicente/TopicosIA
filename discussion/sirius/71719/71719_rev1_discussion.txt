Line:17, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> * The copy/paste layout: Copy the location and size of elements of a source diagram and paste them to elements of a target diagram. By default, the layout are applied on graphical elements representing the same semantic element (same target reference of DSemanticDecorator). It is possible to apply specific rules for matching between source semantic elements and target semantic elements with the org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.layoutDataManager extension point.

Line:18, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> The standard copy/paste allows to copy and paste the semantic elements. The paste action can be customized by a paste tool in the VSM on the receiver (see http://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.html#tools_reference for details). Contrary to the copy/paste layout, the standard copy/paste is also possible by using the same diagram for copy and paste.

Line:20, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> to

Line:21, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> Instead of having several kinds of copy/paste features, it would be interesting to have only one copy action and then a paste special action that will let the choice between paste the semantic, the layout and/or the style.

Line:29, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> Copy action (standard Ctrl+C)

Line:29, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> behavior as current (ie a semantic paste).

Line:29, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> standard Paste action (Ctrl+V)

Line:32, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> Here you must detail what is the entry in the contextual menu, what is look like? I put example in patch set 2.

Line:33, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> I'm not sure that the default behavior should be only paste semantic. What do you think to paste all by default (the semantic, the layout and the style) ?

Line:40, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> In addition, if the paste semantic is applied with the paste layout, the layout of the original semantic elements is applied on the newly created semantic elements (the copies).

Line:40, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> That is the

Line:46, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> 1- not sure to understand the difference...
2- If only paste style is appied, does it work as paste layout (is there a new extension point, is it the same, ...)?

Line:51, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/491895_paste_special/491895.textile -> no sure about that
