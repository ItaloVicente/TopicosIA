DESCRIPTION:

[525261] Add technical id on Sirius meta-model

* Every classes of Sirius meta-model that does not inherit from a Sirius
class, now inherits from IdentifiedElement. Classes from Description
package are not concerned.
* IdentifiedElement has a uid Ettribute of type String that represents
the unique id of the element.
* AirdResourceImpl overloads attachedHelper method to initialize the
xmiid from
the uid when loading and to initialize both uid and xmiid with the same
value when creating an element. attachedHelper also managed the
migration of old model that does not have uid attribute initializing
both uid and xmiid as well.
* Remove DRepresentation.uid attribute
* Add a migration participant to handle special case of old
DRepresentation.uid attribute. For this case, we keep the xmiid, erase
uid with xmiid and update DRepresentationDescriptor.repPath
* Make Sirius EqualityHelper override Ecore.EqualityHelper so that
EAttribute of type ID=true are ignored to know if two EObjects are
equal.

* Add a test to ensure that all meta-classes, that should inherit from
IdentifiedElement, do it effectively.
* Add a test for migration
