See the individual remarks.
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> No need for the full © strings in the commit comment (they are not readable anyway).

Line:2285, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/plugin.xml -> Not important, but for some reason your modified version has trailing white space on all modified lines.

Line:16, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/properties/filters/contribution/computedeobjectreference/ComputedEObjectReferenceValueExpressionFilter.java -> I'm actually wondering if leaving the "description" segment in the namespace was a good idea. I left it because instances of this MM would appear inside the VSM and adding "description" is the convention we use to distinguish runtime info (in the aird) from specification models (in VSMs), but since contribution is (I believe) completely independent on Sirius and the Viewpoint MM, does it make sense?

I think we can leave it like this for now, and if we ever split the contributions MM and support code into a separate utility library we will change its namespace again.

Line:41, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/description/contribution/provider/AddFeatureContributionItemProvider.java -> We should actually completely remove the generation of these static fields, which are useless. See commit a142149a2f33aad7cd0b393e0c6e1bd819a4be69 which did this for the other MMs.

Line:53, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/description/contribution/impl/ContributionFactoryImpl.java -> Maxime, are you using EMF 2.9 from Kepler to perform the regeneration? I believe that is the version we used for the Viewpoint MM itself, and it does not generate litteral strings here. See for example in ViewpointFactoryImpl:

ViewpointFactory theViewpointFactory = (ViewpointFactory) EPackage.Registry.INSTANCE.getEFactory(ViewpointPackage.eNS_URI);

See the following answer to Pierre-Charles review;
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> The copyright field will be removed in the next patch set, so the commit message will be modified.

Line:2285, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/plugin.xml -> I do not see these differences.

Line:16, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/properties/filters/contribution/computedeobjectreference/ComputedEObjectReferenceValueExpressionFilter.java -> Ok, I leave the "description" segment for now.

Line:41, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/description/contribution/provider/AddFeatureContributionItemProvider.java -> It will be done in next patch set.

Line:53, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/description/contribution/impl/ContributionFactoryImpl.java -> I am using EMF 2.9 from Kepler.

I have performed a regeneration, and this time there is no generated literal strings here anymore.
