DESCRIPTION:

[533318] Add standard diagram services to get views

This commit adds some services to get a list of views, ie
DSemanticDecorator, from a diagram according to different aspects:
* representing semantic elements having same EType as current selected
elements
* same mapping as current selected elements
* representing semantic elements having the EType selected by the
end-user (this service will be improved later with completion in the
dialog)
* corresponding to an expression written by the end-user (this service
will be improved later with completion and perhaps with validation in
the dialog)

These services are currently not documented in the release notes as it
is more for a POC.
