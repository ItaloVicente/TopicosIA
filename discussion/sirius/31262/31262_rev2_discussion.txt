DESCRIPTION:

[441417] Avoid same GMF locations after moving several border nodes.

During a move of several border nodes simultaneously, the feedbacks of
these nodes are ignored for conflict detection (in DBorderItemLocator).
This causes that all border nodes have the same GMF location after the
move. This is not acceptable, because this can cause unexpected moves of
border node later.

Add a new list of figures to the DBorderItemLocator.conflicts() method
to allow to complete the brother figures with other figures. In our case
these figures are the feedback figures. Several methods are completed to
have this new parameter.
This list of figures is filled during the showChangeBoundsFeedback()
method (and cleaned during eraseSourceFeedback() method).

Line:90, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/SpecificBorderItemSelectionEditPolicy.java -> This is used when the user moves severl border nodes, the current name is related to new border nodes, we could simply use borderNodeFeedBack. 

The last moved figure corresponds to the primary selection ? It is the one which control all the moves ?

Line:147, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/SpecificBorderItemSelectionEditPolicy.java -> getBorderNodeFeedbacks ? (See my comment on the key name)

Line:245, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/SpecificBorderItemSelectionEditPolicy.java -> IMO, all the currently moved figures should be ignored as knwo their future locations in the getNewBorderNodeFeedback.

Why is getFiguresToIgnore not used here ?

Line:299, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/SpecificBorderItemSelectionEditPolicy.java -> Here we could add the same figure several times, if the same request is used many times. We should check this: I remember some cases when the request is updated on each mouse move (pixel per pixel) until the targeted edit part changes and a new request is created.

Line:234, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/api/figure/locator/DBorderItemLocator.java -> I am not sure that feedback should be mentionned here. DBorderITemLocator do not knwo we use this for feedback computation. The goal of the parameter is to give additonal figures to avoid (in our current calling case those are figures representing future location of several brother figures). 

This comment is valid for all parameters named otherFeedbackFigures in the current class.

Line:50, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/figure/locator/FeedbackDBorderItemLocator.java -> We should add here a comment explainign why the computation is different in the feedback case..

Fix in patch set 3
Line:90, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/SpecificBorderItemSelectionEditPolicy.java -> I completed the comment.

"The last moved figure corresponds to the primary selection ? It is the one which control all the moves ?" --> I don't know. The last moved figure is not added to this list because there will be no further feedback after this one.

Line:147, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/SpecificBorderItemSelectionEditPolicy.java -> Done

Line:245, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/SpecificBorderItemSelectionEditPolicy.java -> Your're right, but in case of drop there is not the problem. But the code is more clear like that.

Line:299, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/graphical/edit/policies/SpecificBorderItemSelectionEditPolicy.java -> OK, I have not had this problem during my testing but I've updated the code to avoid this potential problem.

Line:234, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/api/figure/locator/DBorderItemLocator.java -> Done

Line:50, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/figure/locator/FeedbackDBorderItemLocator.java -> I have not changed this code apsect.
