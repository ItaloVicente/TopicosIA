* Add extension point to let clients choose what is done at unload
* Add mechanism to get the right implementation for resource unloading.
* Switch default unload behavior to an optimized implementation that
don't do resource.unload() anymore.
* Add test
* Update performance test

Line:172, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/SiriusPlugin.java -> This should not be in the plugin activator. 
This might be in the registry, or in a specific class, see the other extension point implementation. 

You also need to listen for plugin activation (see pattern in other extension points)



See sessionFactoryRegistryListener,            deleteHookDescriptorRegistryListener ,             javaActionRegistryListener

Line:189, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/SiriusPlugin.java -> See  sessionFactoryRegistryListener.dispose() and other extension points.

Line:24, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/ResourceStrategyProxyImpl.java -> Why do we need a ResourceStrategy.INTANCE  instead of direcly call the registry ?

Line:52, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/DefaultResourceStrategyDescriptorImpl.java -> Same remark here 

See comments in MM strategy ?

Why do we have this here if we also provide the MM strategy ?

File Comment: plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/api/resource/ResourceStrategyTests.java -> There should be at least one test with a UML resource (preferably with a profile and some stereotypes), with specific checks to make sure the new way of doing things does not leak stuff in the CacheAdapter.

Other missing tests:
* a strategy which returns false (test that the resource is still loaded);
* a strategy which does not return the same value for all resources;
* same as above, but with controlled and/or referenced resources: for example a parent resource A with (controlled) child B: test a strategy which unloads A but not B, and the opposite.
Line:9, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/schema/resourceStrategy.exsd -> It should be mentioned that this API is provisional and may change in the future (indeed, it requires referencing internal classes to extend).

Line:31, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/DefaultOptimizedResourceStrategyImpl.java -> Shouldn't this be EcoreUtil.getAllProperContents(resource, false) ?

Line:47, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/DefaultResourceStrategyDescriptorImpl.java -> Why not IStatus.OK? ("this status represents the nominal case")

Line:52, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/DefaultResourceStrategyDescriptorImpl.java -> Agreed, canHandle() could test itself that

   resourceStrategyType == UNLOAD_AT_RESOURCESET_DISPOSE && !isFromPackageRegistry(uri)

Line:48, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/MetaModelResourceStrategyDescriptorImpl.java -> This seems the wrong way to identify a metamodel. It would identify a copy of uml.ecore in a workspace loaded as a semantic resource as a "metamodel", and not handle it.

Line:33, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/ResourceStrategy.java -> Calling the method "unload*" seems wrong, as the whole point is that sometime we may *not* unload it.

Line:29, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/ResourceStrategyRegistry.java -> Why a lowercase "i"?

Line:172, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/SiriusPlugin.java -> Disagreed: the registry itself should be kept independant of Eclipse, and more generally of any concrete mechanism from which we get the configuration information.

Using data from the Eclipse registry only makes sense when running under Eclipse, which corresponding exactly to the cases when SiriusPlugin.Implementation#start() will be called.

In other contexts (standalone setting if we ever support it, inside tests), other mechanisms could be imagined to fill the registry. The registry itself should not be aware/dependent of them.

Line:48, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/MetaModelResourceStrategyDescriptorImpl.java -> I am guilty, I misread the thing last week and put Laurent on this way.
The previous code was OK.

File Comment: plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.junit/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/api/resource/ResourceStrategyTests.java -> I also added the test with controlled resource even if it is not the best place to do it as this test class intent is not to test which resource in resourceSet is handled but how it is handled.
Line:9, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/schema/resourceStrategy.exsd -> Done

Line:31, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/DefaultOptimizedResourceStrategyImpl.java -> Done

Line:52, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/DefaultResourceStrategyDescriptorImpl.java -> I removed this class to integrate the MM check in DefaultOptimizedResourceStrategy

Line:33, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/ResourceStrategy.java -> that's true :)

Line:24, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/ResourceStrategyProxyImpl.java -> If I do this, the client will have to right the code below:
        ResourceStrategy resourceStrategyDescriptor = ResourceStrategyRegistry.getInstance().getResourceStrategyDescriptor(ResourceStrategyType.UNLOAD_AT_RESOURCESET_DISPOSE, resource);
        return resourceStrategyDescriptor.unloadAtResourceSetDispose(resource, monitor);

The problem is that, the client may easily call a method on ResourceStrategy that is not coherent with the ResourceStrategyType he used to get the right ResourceStrategy.
Today there is one method unloadAtResourceSetDispose but tomorrow there will be potentially other.

An other solution is to define the unloadAtResourceSetDispose directly on the ResourceStrategyRegistry. Then that proxy would be useless.
But in that case ResourceStrategyRegistry in no more a simple registry but a class capable of providing the right ResourceStrategy. It is a matter of what role I give to what class
Moreover an inconvenient of this solution is to redefine the ResourceStrategy method on ResourceStrategyRegistry class.

In my next commit I'll implement the latter solution

Line:29, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/resource/strategy/ResourceStrategyRegistry.java -> Done

Line:172, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/viewpoint/SiriusPlugin.java -> Ok for this separation of concern between what is Eclipse and was is the real API. But the code would be clearer and safer if the extension point management is in its own class, with all the common stuff : descriptor, listener,...
