DESCRIPTION:

[423473] Add version tags during preSave

This should be done on Group and DAnalysis to remember the creation
version. Otherwise, the next loads will trigger the migration (until the
next save).

This is done in resource handlers during preSave. eDeliver has been
deactivated during the version modification to avoid to trigger
notification while save is performed.

Correctly launch the indirectly collapsed node migration. It has been
introduced in 6.5.3 et 6.7.0 versions. The migration application
condition must trigger the migration for version < 6.5.3 or version
between 6.6.0 and 6.7. The sequence migration part has also been
modified.
