I'm not sure this is enough. Does it means we will stille get this vague/generic "Close" action available on diagrams when some elements are actually selected?

The original ticket for which this action was added, #521367, mentioned "The close session action available on aird IFile tree viewer item". It seems the root issue is not about empty/non-empty selection, but that the action is contributed "everywhere" and not just on "aird IFile" in specific contextx (e.g. the model explorer or other CNF views).

The original ticket is just about moving the action from one plugin to another.   
The only problem is the availability of the action on empty selection. The action is not available on any element but only on aird file already except for empty selection.
