DESCRIPTION:

[464269] Update selection after tool execution for all dialects

According to the elementsToSelect interpreted expression, update
selection after tool execution.
Selection is temporary stored on DRepresentationContainer.uiState.
Then, on postCommit, these data are used to update selection.

Add test to check selection after tool execution in diagram, table and
tree.

As this commit enables the tree and table selection, independently from
"Elements To Select" expression, it also handles the bug 428545.
A migration participant has been added to keep the old default behavior
for table and trees(no selection by default). To do so, this migration
participant set "Elements To Select" to an empty expression
