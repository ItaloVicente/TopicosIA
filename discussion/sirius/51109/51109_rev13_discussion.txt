DESCRIPTION:

[464269] Update selection after tool execution for all dialects

According to the elementsToSelect interpreted expression, update
selection after tool execution.
Selection is temporary stored on DRepresentationContainer.uiState.
Then, on postCommit, these data are used to update selection.

Add test to check selection after tool execution in diagram, table and
tree.

As this commit enables the tree and table selection, independently from
"Elements To Select" expression, it also handles the bug 428545.
A migration participant has been added to keep the old default behavior
for table and trees(no selection by default). To do so, this migration
participant set "Elements To Select" to an empty expression

Line:70, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/migration/InitializeElementsToSelectExpressionForTreeMigrationTest.java -> A try/catch in test should exists only if we want test exception throwing.
Here we can have a stacktrace displayed in stdout with a green test. Let the test throw Exception.

Line:130, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/tree/tools/SelectionInTreeAfterToolExecutionTest.java -> Why this bloc is commented?

Line:38, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/migration/description/InitializeCreationToolElementsToSelectExpressionParticipant.java -> You should specify in javadoc it is only for tree representation.

Line:56, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/migration/description/InitializeCreationToolElementsToSelectExpressionParticipant.java -> Use instead StandardServices.class.getName()

Line:69, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/migration/description/InitializeCreationToolElementsToSelectExpressionParticipant.java -> Use of EMF TreeIterator instead of  Iterables.filter() will be more efficient because you can use TreeIterator.prune() when you detect a RepresentationDescription not instance of TreeDescription.

Line:130, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/AbstractDTableViewerManager.java -> Why this change, it is a cleanup, should be in another commit.

Line:54, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> In object paradigm, we call class according to their role and not what they do. We could rename this class CreatedDRepresentationElementSelector.

Line:62, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> NotificationFilter.NOT_TOUCH should be used with a and operator instead of a or one. You could move in in first with a and operator.

Instead of using DanglingRefRemovalTrigg
er.IS_ATTACHMENT filter since Eclipse Mars you can use TransactionChangeDescription.getObjectsToDetach(); to get list of top level attached objects in a EMF Transaction. This can avoid a costly and useless Notifications analysis on Mars. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/35876/8/plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.table.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/table/ui/tools/internal/editor/provider/TableUIUpdater.java

Line:86, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> This constructor seems never used.

Line:103, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> Consequently of previous comment, the init method code could be here.

Line:109, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> We could have TED in parameter directly.

Line:277, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> Here you filter elements to not keep someones which are contained in other ones. But you test only direct parent relationship while you can have indirect parent relationship, like grandparent for example. Then you should use EcoreUtil.isAncestor() and use this test directly in the first loop to be more efficiant. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/35876/8/plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.table.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/table/ui/tools/internal/editor/provider/TableUIUpdater.java .

Line:314, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> This Runnable could be in its own public class file to be reusable in other context.

Line:84, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> This cleanup could be done in another commit, especially because this commit is big.

Line:68, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/api/command/AbstractCommandFactory.java -> Why this change to only add an override? If we add this change you could also remove the useless javadoc.
Same below.

Line:59, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/command/builders/AbstractCommandBuilder.java -> Why this change to only add an override? If we add this change you could also remove the useless javadoc.

Line:33, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/command/builders/CommandBuilderUtils.java -> Instead of having this utility class with a anonymous class, we could have a GetElementsToSelectTask class.
And in caller we could have "command.getTasks().add(new GetElementsToSelectTask())" instead of "CommandBuilderUtils.addEvaluateSelectionExpressionTask()".

I thinks this commit could be splited in several smaller commits :
- one for tests
- ones for migration
- ones for spec update
- one for feature implementation.

Line:48, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/tree/tools/SelectionInTreeAfterToolExecutionTest.java -> Should be executed in auto-refresh as in manual refresh DTreeItem will not be created and selection cannot be tested.

Line:94, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/tree/tools/SelectionInTreeAfterToolExecutionTest.java -> As for diagram, for which we reveal created view to select even for hidden views, for tree/table we want reveal created view to select then parent DTreeItem/DLine should be expanded, this is the default for DLine but not for DTreeItem.

Line:278, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> In addition this should be the choice of specifier if he doesn't want select a parent created view and its children. With this code how a specifier can specify to select all created views.

Line:279, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> Be aware of following scenario without this loop to have all created views selected :
- In a tree representation containing a collapsed DTreeItem with 2 children, delete the root DTreeItem and do undo => the root DTreeItem is restored expanded with its 2 children visible and they are all selected.

This occurs because this listener is also called on undo/redo. To fix that you can use !Boolean.TRUE.equals(event.getTransaction().getOptions().get(Transaction.OPTION_IS_UNDO_REDO_TRANSACTION)) condition filter.

TODO: add this scenario in a auto test, TreeItemDeletionToolsTest.testDeleteUndo() fails because of that.

Line:70, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/migration/InitializeElementsToSelectExpressionForTreeMigrationTest.java -> Done

Line:48, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/tree/tools/SelectionInTreeAfterToolExecutionTest.java -> Done

Line:94, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/tree/tools/SelectionInTreeAfterToolExecutionTest.java -> the automatic expand is not handle in this ticket

Line:130, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/unit/tree/tools/SelectionInTreeAfterToolExecutionTest.java -> because it was not working as decribed above.
But now it is working with auto refresh= true

Line:38, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/migration/description/InitializeCreationToolElementsToSelectExpressionParticipant.java -> Done

Line:56, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/migration/description/InitializeCreationToolElementsToSelectExpressionParticipant.java -> Done

Line:69, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/migration/description/InitializeCreationToolElementsToSelectExpressionParticipant.java -> No because I just want to filter viewpoint.getOwnedRepresentations() but not iterates on every elements inside viewpoint. So I am not n a case where where i could use prune()

Line:130, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/AbstractDTableViewerManager.java -> because type is AbstractDTreeEditor and not AbstractDTableEditor

Line:54, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> I do not agree because it is not about only created elements and the role of this class is besides to selectDRepresentation
And I would prefer keep Listener suffix to easily understand the nature of this class.
I could possibly call it DRepresentationElementsSelectorListener

Line:62, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> Sirius is supposed to work from juno to the latest platform. I prefer keeping a single code

Line:86, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> I know but this class was previously expected to be inherited but it not the case in this commit. So I let this code to avoid wondering how to mutualize code in init method

Line:103, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> see previous comment

Line:109, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> I prefer use only one parameter as editor is also used in this class. A second paramter would be redundant

Line:277, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> I agree with the three remarks.
But it works as it was in  SelectCreatedDRepresentationElementsListener(previous name of this class)
In order to not overload this ticket (particularly for the three test to make), I propose to create a bugzilla to handle the three remarks

Line:278, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> cf remark above

Line:279, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> cf remark above

Line:314, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/editor/SelectDRepresentationElementsListener.java -> I let it as it was in SelectCreatedDRepresentationElementsListener

Line:84, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> it could :)

Line:68, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/api/command/AbstractCommandFactory.java -> Because, there were changes in the previous patchset.
I removed that changes

Line:59, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/command/builders/AbstractCommandBuilder.java -> Because, there were changes in the previous patchset.
I removed that changes

Line:33, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/command/builders/CommandBuilderUtils.java -> Done
