DESCRIPTION:

[442066] Compute and use arbitrary ids for equality checking in table

Change the DCellCandidate and DLineCandidate implementation to avoid
getURI calls and instead use the same pattern as in the diagram refresh.

This brings a significant performance enhancement during the table
refresh.

Change-Id: I15e95f41d0d2921bf2925397c7bc4eaece6f8b83

Line:112, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.table/src/org/eclipse/sirius/table/business/internal/refresh/DCellCandidate.java -> I don't think it can be significant in practice, but why allocate an array (presumably on the heap) just to read the individual cells and then forget about it? Using 4 locals (on the stack) would be more straightforward (and possible marginally more efficient, though it can probably not be measurable). The only drawback I see is to have to invent 4 names. (Note: same "issue" in the other class).

Line:154, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.table/src/org/eclipse/sirius/table/business/internal/refresh/DCellCandidate.java -> This version uses a boxed Boolean and (unless the compiler optimizes it away), tests it for null-ness up to 11 times in the worst case where we return true. The version of equals() proposed  in this same patch set for DLineCandidate seems to use a more efficient pattern with early return as soon as the result is unambiguously determined.
