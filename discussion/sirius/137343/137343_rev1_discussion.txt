DESCRIPTION:

[538853] Ensure backward compatibility with Ecore Tools 3.3.0

Ecore Tools 3.3.0 uses some operations/derived references (in its
DesignServices class) which have been removed for this ticket. Since
Ecore Tools is in maintenance with no new release planned at the
moment, so this would ensure Sirius 6.2 would still be compatible with
this release.

Bug: 538853

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-2

Note that while it seems to work with this patch, without additional changes it breaks the regeneration of the diagram.genmodel: we declare in the GenModel that our generated code is Java 1.5-compliant, so JET refuses to parse the default methods. Targetting Java 8 in the GenModel does not seem to fix the issue, I have not yet understood why and don't have time to investigate further at the moment.

In this state, the patch should be seen as nothing more than a possible (ugly) workaround in case Ecore Tools can not adapt to the change.

This was fixed directly in Ecore Tools 3.3.1.
