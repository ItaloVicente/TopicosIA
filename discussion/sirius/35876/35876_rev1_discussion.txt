Beside the individual comments, I'm very worried about the negative performance impact of this change. Both its implementation in terms of listeners and its impact on how much tree items will need to be created/refreshed.

At the very least it should be an optional behavior, with 0 impact if not explicitly enabled, and proofs (by actual measures of before/after performance on non-trivial cases) that the performance impact is small enough.

Also, maybe they are planned for a separate commit, but the behavior change this implies would need explicit tests, and probably a line in the release notes ("User Visible Changes") if it were enabled.
Line:43, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.synchronizer/src/org/eclipse/sirius/synchronizer/CreatedOutput.java -> API change; needs a release note.

Line:72, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/helper/ModelElementAdditionCollector.java -> Just because an EObject is newly referenced by someone does not mean it is "new" and has been added. I have not tested this so I may be wrong, but this whole method seems to consider as "new" way too much elements, in particular ones which were just moved to a different location in the model.

Line:76, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/helper/ModelElementAdditionCollector.java -> Why handle just the first and ignore the rest? Shouldn't it be something like this:

    for (EObject added : Sets.difference(Sets.newHashSet(newValue), Sets.newHashSet(oldValue))) {
      manageAddedEObject(added);
    }

Line:88, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/helper/ModelElementAdditionCollector.java -> Performance impact.

Line:94, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/helper/ModelElementAdditionCollector.java -> Potentially huge performance impact.

Line:141, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/helper/ModelElementAdditionCollector.java -> Performance impact (especially in the negative case, where we will walk the whole target containment chain for *each* semanticDirectlyAddedEObjects).

Line:60, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/helper/ModelElementAdditionNotificationFilter.java -> Performance impact.

Line:67, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/helper/ModelElementAdditionNotificationFilter.java -> Not obvious why only the first element is looked at.

Line:70, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/helper/ModelElementAdditionNotificationFilter.java -> Performance impact.
