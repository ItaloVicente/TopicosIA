DESCRIPTION:

[DRAFT] Export Sirius as ELK - Wrong node location in container

Export Sirius diagram into ELK graph - Wrong location of node or
container contained in container. This
delta corresponds to the insets of container. It is visible with a space
between the node and the edge in Layout Graph view. There were 2
mistakes:
    * The insets was added to the node, the child, and not to the
container.
    * The location must be set by ignoring the insets. Indeed, the
coordinates of an ElkNode must not considered insets. It is used by the
algorithm only.
