DESCRIPTION:

[445621] Too many Notification.REMOVE when remove a sub tree

Add ModelAccessor/IMetamodelExtender.eRemoveCrossReferences() to split
EObject deletion of cross references removal aspect.
With that, in DanglingRefRemovalTrigger, we can do deletion only for top
level detached EObject and only call
ModelAccessor.eRemoveCrossReferences() on eAllContents().

Line:192, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> This set aimed to reference all the effectively detached object and they contents. 

Then we analyze all the attached object as some sub elements could have been re-attached to new containers

Line:196, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> As the detached EObject could ..

This previous checks were done to avoid to remove dangling references on a re-attached object.

If we do not call the getChangedEObj... for this, we should rename and change the method instead adding a new parameter.

Line:232, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> In this patch set, this method is only called with haveChildren = false. 
The method must be renamed and this parameter removed.

Line:192, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> We don't need to make a difference between detached and attached objects, it is more efficient to test take detachedObjects set get from notification are really detached object by calling eContainer()!=null, here eContainer() is sufficient as it is top level detached objects.

Line:196, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> This my previous comment, in addition getChangedEObjectsAndChildren() method is badly named, it get added/removed objects not changed ones. And calling Iterables.filter() several times on a same list is not efficient, we should do a single iteration on notifications list to get really detached objects.

Line:232, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> Yes a more deep refactoring of this class should be done.

Line:232, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> Additional remark: with this method, if haveChildren is true and called for the detached eobject, we must not do the eAllcontent in the command.

Line:244, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> It seems that another optimization would be to check if the root if in the list and if true, to avoid to do the eAllContent()

Line:196, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> We do not filter with the same predicates.

We did it on two passes: the one to detect all effectively detached object. The second to detect the attachment done on element which are not known as detached objects.

In one pass, on only the root deleted/attached objects, this would require to analyze all attachment notifications and make a eResource to check it has not been reattached. 

Note that the getChangedEObjectsAndChildren (to rename) does not return the notifiers but the values (new or old regarding one notification) and so a detached EObject could now have a eContainer !=null but be indirectly detached. So with the current patch set, we could make several times a eDelete or eCrossReference on the same eobjects.

Line:332, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.java -> I think we should continue to use the previous way to detect all detached objects. 

But if we want to decrease the number of Remove notifcation (after checkings the effects on manuel refresh, red cross decorators, ...) we could here call either eDelete or eRemoveCrossReferences regarding the value of the eContainer() at the execution time.

Line:114, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release Notes.textile -> A better formulation would be appreciated. 
Just indicate the goal of eRemoveCrossReferences and indicates that it has been extracted from the eDelete and that the eDelete remove the element from its container and calls the remove cross reference method to avoid dangling references.

Line:269, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ecore.extender/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ecore/extender/business/api/accessor/IMetamodelExtender.java -> Javadoc should explain what the method does.

Line:527, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ecore.extender/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ecore/extender/business/api/accessor/ModelAccessor.java -> It seems we should do some permission checks, see eDelete()

Line:189, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ecore.extender/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ecore/extender/business/internal/accessor/ecore/EcoreIntrinsicExtender.java -> It sees that the element will be removed from its container, except if the reference to ignore predicate forbid it.

The javadoc does not indicate that.
