DESCRIPTION:

[495240] Integrate rotatable node style.

This patchset provides a new custom style to define rotatable nodes. It
could be used for bordered node and node mappings.
To use it the specifier must specify a custom style for his node
mapping. Then it specifies a org.eclipse.sirius.rotatableImage extension
and set the same id than the one defined in the custom style.
Two possibilities exists:
* if only the north image is specified, this image will be rotated when
the node is moved.
* if all the images (north, south, east, west) are defined the depending
on the position of the node, the best image will be used to represent
the node.
 
In case of bordered node the image will change depending on which
container side the node is set. In case of node the first connection
angle is used to rotate the node image.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-2

For the moment, I not reviewed the code itself. But:
1- This new rotatable node style muste be documented: probably in "Sirius Developer Manual/Extension Points" and also shortly explained in the "Release Notes"
2- This new plugin must be added to Sirius (in Tycho build, integrated in a feature, ...)
3- A test exploiting this new style must be added, at least in a first time, a project using this new extension point can be added in the bugzilla.

Furthermore, all these points will facilitate the review.

The test projects were added in plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.rotatable for the VSM and sirius/plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.rotatable.instance as example of using the rotatable style.

Sure, sorry for the missing elements, I tried to add them, I expect that it will ease your review now.
