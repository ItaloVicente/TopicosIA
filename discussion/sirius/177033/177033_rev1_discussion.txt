DESCRIPTION:

[571400] Refresh instance role edit part in ui thread

Before commit c5831f39cd7dc4a3705827e1849ea4d55a9ee2e2 ([567517] Refresh
each InstanceRoleEditPart only once), the InstanceRole edit parts where
refreshed for each bounds changes detected by Execution edit parts.

ExecutionEditPart.handleNotificationEvent calls were triggered by the
DiagramEventBroker in a non aggregate way, causing a huge amount of
refresh on diagrams with a lot of InstanceRole and Execution elements.

Now this code has been moved to an aggregate post commit listener
installed by the SequenceDiagramEditPart which dramatically reduces the
number of InstanceRole edit part refresh by triggering a single refresh
by impacted InstanceRole.

But the default DiagramEventBroker in Sirius is a
org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.diagram.ui.DiagramEventBrokerThreadSafe which
specifically handles notifications that occurs from a worker thread /
non-ui thread. The new ZOrderAndInstanceRolePartRefresher mimics the
DiagramEventBrokerThreadSafe when the current diagram event broker is
the default one.

When it is not the case, the InstanceRole edit parts to refresh are
computed and refreshed in an asynchronous way.
