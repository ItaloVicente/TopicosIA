There won't be others changes in this patch. If I find others things to adapt for Papyrus, I will create another patch and another bug and it will probably be for the next Sirius release. 


I thank you for the review.

Line:124, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/editor/tabbar/Tabbar.java -> The 'part' parameter shadows the 'part' field in Tabbar. I'll rename the argument to make things clearer.

Line:125, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/tools/internal/editor/tabbar/Tabbar.java -> 'toolBar' with a capital 'B' as used here actually resolves to the Tabbar.toolBar field, not the 'toolbar' (lower case 'b') passed in the parameters. It should not change anything given this new method is currently only called in a single place with the field as argument. Still, it's probably not what was intended. I'll fix that myself before merging.
