DESCRIPTION:

[510040] Add validation for viewpoints activation in session editor

Viewpoints with missing activated viewpoint dependencies now cannot be
activated. When trying to activate, an error message tells the user what
dependencies are missing and checkbox is marked with a black square
instead of a tick meaning it has not been activated. Selecting a
viewpoint with missing dependencies also triggers the display of the
error message.

Viewpoints activation now react to double click.

When deactivating a viewpoint, all activated viewpoints depending on it
are also deactivated.
