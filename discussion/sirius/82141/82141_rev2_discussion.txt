DESCRIPTION:

[502048] Improve diagnostics for AQL evaluation errors

We create a BasicDiagnostic to hold up to two children. In most cases it
will have only one, but unless client code explicitly digged into it it
would get an empty Diagnostic.getMessage() (from the wrapper) instead of
the details from the only actual child.

Instead, explicitly unwrap the contained diagnostic if there is only one
so that its full details are directly exposed.
