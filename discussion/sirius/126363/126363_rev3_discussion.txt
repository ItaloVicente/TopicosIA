DESCRIPTION:

[537219] Fix deadlock and concurrent writing

Fix a deadlock occurring when saving a VSM with aird editor opened as
well as a representation.

This fix don't refresh anymore aird editor models block tree viewer for
each resource set change.

This old behavior introduced to see label changes of a model tree
element in the aird editor models block after a modification made
elsewhere seems to be obsolete.

Also fix concurrent writing access of 536004 happening for the same
reason.

Random thread order execution is the reason why we have the first or
second issue.
