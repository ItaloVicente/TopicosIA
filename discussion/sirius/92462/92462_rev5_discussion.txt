DESCRIPTION:

[510040] Add handling of session's semantic models

A new graphic block has been added to the session's editor. It allows to
visualize the semantic sessions external or not that are loaded by the
session and the representations of their elements. Functionalities
around are the following:

-It has two buttons allowing to add/remove external dependencies.
-The graphic items are sorted to always have the same viewing order.
-At opening of the editor, all semantic models are auto-expanded to
their root package to avoid to expand it manually.
-The semantic models' elements can also be edited directly with the
properties view when selecting it.
-The contextual menu available to manipulate semantic models and their
representations on the "Model Explorer" has been made available too to
this graphic component allowing fast updates.

- Fix viewpoint tree viewer not refreshing when changing viewpoint
status from ModelViewExplorer

-Updated session's editor blocks descriptions and title.
