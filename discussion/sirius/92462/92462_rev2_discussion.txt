DESCRIPTION:

[510040] Add handling of session's semantic models

- Add the semantic models block in the session's editor.

- Fix viewpoint tree viewer not refreshing when changing viewpoint
status from ModelViewExplorer

-Updated session's editor blocks descriptions and title.

-The models viewer auto expand to the root package of each semantic
models loaded from the session

- External dependencies in the semantic models tree are under the
Project Dependencies item.

- Updated SiriusCommonContentProvider so it can be used in the session's
editor.

- A button "Remove" is active on external dependencies that don't have
representations associated to their elements. It allows to delete these.

- A button "Add" is always active and allows to load an external
semantic model into the session.

- The viewer is sorted. I.e the dependency item is on the first
position like in model explorer (same sorter).

-Set a minimum width of 200 to the viewpoint browser to avoid being not
readable when models block is too large.

- Semantic model element can be edited with properties view.

(19 comments)
Line:37, /COMMIT_MSG -> Commit messages should be more synthetic. Not necessarily shorter (sometimes a long explanation/justification is needed even for short patches), but focused on the what and *why* instead of the *how*. It shouldn't just restate in english the code changes in the patch, but give the reviewer context to understand the reason for the technical changes.

Line:20, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/plugin.properties -> "in the same project" is not true when not using the "Modeling Project" nature. I'll talk with Fred about the wording, but in the meantime I propose "Show all the semantic models managed by this session.": shorter and still meaningful (to me at least, not sure about non-technical users).

Line:21, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/plugin.properties -> Maybe "Semantic Models".

Line:22, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/plugin.properties -> Not sure this part is needed.

Line:22, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/plugin.properties -> Proposal: "viewpoints applicable to the session''s" [semantic models].

Line:138, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/DefaultSessionEditorPage.java -> No need to call MessageFormat.format if the message does not require interpolation. Same remark for the other instances below (and maybe elsewhere).

Warning: removing the call to format() may require changing the property value if it contained single quotes (must be doubled to get the correct result with format(), but not if we use the value directly.

Line:158, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> I don't see the corresponding removeSessionsListener() in dispose().

Line:163, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> We're passed a specific session in the constructor. We do we need to care about other sessions that may exist in the system?

Line:182, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Could be a lambda.

Line:189, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Could be a lambda.

Line:243, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> This part looks like it comes from org.eclipse.sirius.ui.tools.internal.actions.analysis.RemoveSemanticResourceAction. Any reason not to simply call that?

Line:268, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Could be a lambda.

Line:293, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Could be a lambda.

Line:367, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Should be a Set, or we may end up with multiple instance of the the Resource (from different EObjects) in the result. Unless that's what we want, but I'm not sure it is.

Line:403, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> lambda

Line:419, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> lambda

Line:40, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/item/NoDynamicProjectDependencies.java -> Is there a way to avoid so much code duplication with ProjectDependenciesItemImpl? Make one of the classes inherit from the other and override just the minimum, or make ProjectDependenciesItemImpl configurable with a flag to not be dynamic?

Line:43, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/navigator/ManageSessionActionProvider.java -> The new method could be called here.

Line:194, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/navigator/SiriusCommonContentProvider.java -> That's a little risky (and difficult to read): can really non of these be null?

Line:20, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/plugin.properties -> I don't think it is really meaningful for end user without technical knowledge. Something like "Show all your models editable with this Sirius session." would be better but I will use yours for the moment until it has really been thought about.

Line:21, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/plugin.properties -> Done

Line:22, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/plugin.properties -> I am not sure that it is enough for end-user. What the user want to know for me is that viewpoints provides editor for its semantic models. What is a viewpoint available for session? To what end for end user?
I suggest something like :
"Show all viewpoints providing editors you can use to edit your models. Activating a viewpoint give you access to all its editors." 
The target of this editor is end user without a lot of knowledge about Sirius the message should be addressed directly to him.

For the moment I will used yours until it has been really thought about.

Line:22, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/plugin.properties -> Done

Line:158, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Done

Line:163, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> No we don't

Line:182, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Done

Line:189, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Done

Line:243, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Maybe at some point but not anymore.

Line:268, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Done

Line:293, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Done

Line:367, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Done

Line:403, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Not for this one because SelectionAdapter has two method with the same signature

Line:419, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Done

Line:40, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/item/NoDynamicProjectDependencies.java -> Done

Line:43, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/navigator/ManageSessionActionProvider.java -> Done

Line:194, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/navigator/SiriusCommonContentProvider.java -> In fact this code is useless. In editor we don't show the project item so this case does not need to be handled.
