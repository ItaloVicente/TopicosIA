DESCRIPTION:

[471104] Make tests fail systematically

Since the creation of tests MoveEdgeGroupTest for bug 471104, they fail
randomly. This is
caused by a wrong waiting condition. On standard environment the test
pass (but wrongly), they should fail. And they fail randomly only on
"slow" environment.
This commit adds complementary waiting condition and always reveals the
problem. Another commit will follow with the fix.
