DESCRIPTION:

[496532] extend IRefreshExtension to allow for overriding the refresh

Introduce an interface IRefreshOverride which can be implemented by
IRefreshExtension instances to override the refresh default
implementation.

This mechanism could have been made more general but we don't envision
many usages besides very specific or experimental contexts.
Because of this we won't expose this new possibility in the release
notes.

-2 because we need a test, else -1
Line:22, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/api/refresh/IRefreshOverride.java -> we should open a ticket for next major release of Sirius to include aroundRefresh method in IRefresh API and then remove IRefreshOverride

Line:37, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/api/refresh/IRefreshOverride.java -> seems a little vague
Why not doRefresh(DDDiagram) ?

Line:148, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/api/refresh/RefreshExtensionService.java -> try to avoid that ;) it is not needed anymore

Line:22, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/api/refresh/IRefreshOverride.java -> https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497653

Line:37, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/api/refresh/IRefreshOverride.java -> That comes from the "before, after, around" terminology of aspect programming.

Around gives a clear indication of the fact that it will prevent the execution of the original code whereas "doRefresh" does not gives this hint.

Line:148, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/api/refresh/RefreshExtensionService.java -> Noted for next time or if I need to push a new patchset.

Line:37, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/api/refresh/IRefreshOverride.java -> If someone answers the aroundRefresh() method by true, we will stop to look for "around" refreshes and we will not do the default refresh. 

But will we call the before/after refresh ? Which ones, all ?

Line:148, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/api/refresh/RefreshExtensionService.java -> I am not sure that it is safe to execute all aroundRefreshExtension. 
Should not we stop as soon as one did the refresh? It seems very dangerous to have the refresh order depending on the plugin load order, should not have at least some priority attribute we choose to accept to call several aroundRefresh() ? 

We have to make sure that all refresh calls on the same data/context will always produce the same and reproductible result (with consistent expressions).

No, we will call all the overrides, but that's right we will not do the default refresh.

before/after are called in every situation

Line:148, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/api/refresh/RefreshExtensionService.java -> It's been discussed in the bugzilla already and it seemed to be the best option we had. BTW there **is** a priority attribute.

This capability is provided to ease initiatives/experiments and could even, in fairly extreme use cases be usefull to get more performances.  We don't envision many usages besides very specific or experimental contexts and that's the main rationale behind not providing a specific test-case for it besides the manual one attached in the bugzilla.
