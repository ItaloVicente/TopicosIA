DESCRIPTION:

[443592] ViewpointSelectionDialog now handles viewpoints to deselect.

The SWTBot class "ViewpointSelectionDialog" takes now into account
viewpoints to deselect in the method "selectViewpoint(Set<String>,
Set<String>)".

In order to do that, a new class is proposed to process the "Viewpoint
Selection" dialog.

-1 for the undocumented API change, and for the removal of Movida-specific branch (while it is not used currently, removing it does not seem necessary as part of this change).
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Minor nitpick: the commit's title should be imperative and not end with a "."

This is not a hard rule, but a convention followed by many projects [1] [2] [3]. As for source code formatting, the details are not that important (we can discuss ad nauseam if it's better this way or another), but following a uniform set of conventions makes things easier to follow.

I won't downvote your change for this, but I wanted to take the opportunity to share the information and the links below.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> The commit message should not talk about a "proposed" change. It should be worded as if the change is accepted, because once it is accepted and merged in the repo, it is not "proposed" anymore.

Line:123, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.swtbot.support/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/swtbot/support/api/dialog/ViewpointSelectionDialog.java -> This new method and the next one are API changes, and should be documented in the release notes.

Line:294, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/viewpoint/ViewpointSelection.java -> Why remove all this branch of the code?
