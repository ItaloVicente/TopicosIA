DESCRIPTION:

[432986] Enable EMF's child extender mechanism

When moving the diagram metamodel out of the core, we lost some creation
items in the VSM editor's context menus, as they moved into an EPackage
the core genmodel does not know about. Sirius already provides several
ad hoc mechanisms to handle this kind of things (see
DialectUISercice.provide*() methods), but none of them correspond to the
locations that need to be extended in this case.

Instead or creating yet another ad hoc extension method (or two), enable
EMF's native mechanism to handle this. It should probably be enabled
everywhere and replace our custom mechanisms, but for now just do the
minimum:
* enable "Extensible Provider Factory" in all the description EPackages
  in viewpoint.genmodel so that the item providers look for extensions;
* enable "Child Creation Extenders" in all the description EPackages in
  diagram.genmodel so that the extensions for viewpoint.ecore are
  properly generated;
* remove the custom contributions which were added in
  DiagramDialectUIServices.provideNewChildDescriptors(), as they are now
  redundant and create duplicate entries in the menus.

The patch is rather large, but the only things manually changed are a
few boolean in the 2 genmodels and the change in
DiagramDialectUIServices.provideNewChildDescriptors(). All the rest is
the result of the EMF re-generation.

With this change, we get back the 4 menu items which were identified as
missing compared to M6 (before the split). See the bugzilla for the
reasons why we think they are the only ones.

Overall it looks good to me to be integrated though the task is not completely "done". Here we only rely on this mechanism to fix some recently introduced regression but are not using it for all of our child extensions needs.

I had concerns about the "ResourceLocator" extension mechanism which allows an adopter to override labels or images but looking closer, with this change the resource locator returned by the AdapterFactories is now the ChildCreationExtenderManager with SiriusEditPlugin.INSTANCE always being the primary resource locator and this one provides the extension point.

To generalize it we will need 
- to  enable it for all of the Sirius genmodels and not only viewpoint and diagram.
- to remove all the collectChildDescriptors API we introduced, at least :
DialectUIManager, RepresentationTemplateEditManager and FeatureExtensionsUIManager

Should we track a bugzilla for that ? I'm reluctant to postpone this as that would make us stop across the bridge.
