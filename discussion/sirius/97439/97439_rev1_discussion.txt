DESCRIPTION:

[470599] Apply to Sirius the same fix as in EMF's ECrossReferenceAdapter

Some history for context:
* In the context of bug #470599 for Sirius 3.1, which was about
  improving session loading performances, we noticed a performance
  issue in EMF's own ECrossReferenceAdapter.
* This was reported to EMF via bug #471106, with a proposal for a fix.
  After analysis, Ed Merks found a less disruptive way of getting the
  same performance benefits, and merged that. We applied the
  equivalent patch to our own ECrossReferenceAdapter
  implementations (we have several, for historical reasons).
* It turns out that the "clever hack" that was merged in EMF caused a
  regression with duplicate entires for some inverse cross-references
  in some cases, see [1].
* For EMF 2.13 (Oxygen version), Ed fixed the regression with [2].

This commit is about applying the same fix as in [2] to our own
ECrossReferenceAdapters. There was a risk that it would undo the
performance benefits of the initial change.

Here are the session load times reported by Session1MillionTests:
* With EMF 2.13M6 (before [2]) and Sirius 5.0M7:
  - 11s / 10s /  9s / 10s /  9s /  9s
* With EMF 2.13M7 (with [2]) and Sirius 5.0M7:
  - 13s / 10s / 11s / 11s / 11s / 11s
* With EMF 2.13M7 (with [2]) and Sirius 5.0M7 with this patch:
  - 11s / 10s / 12s / 11s / 10s / 10s

There may be a small slowdown (around 10%), which if real is not
insignificant, but it's better to be *correct* and a little slower
than fast and broken.
