Thanks for the contribution.
We just released 6.4.0 and are preparing a 6.4.1 with an fix for a bug we missed.
This patch will probably be integrated in a later version as we try to only include what is strictly required for such maintenance versions.

Welcome.

Sorry for asking. May I know the missing bug ? Is it a critical issue ?. Actually, we have changed 6.4.0 as target-platform for our product.

There are two minor issues:
* https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=563117
* https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=569473

Both are related to a new feature introduced in 6.4.0 and only available through APIs (Bug 563117 - Copy format to existing/new diagram based on source to target semantic elements mapping), so there is zero chance that it would impact you (unless you explicitly used these new APIs).

Thanks for the reply, Yes, the last target version was 6.3.4. Those bugs won't affect our product
