DESCRIPTION:

[466718] Cache computation of semantic candidates during a Refresh

During a single refresh operation
AbstractSynchronizerHelper.evaluateCandidateExpression() might be called
from two different sources with the same parameters (containerView and
mapping):
.MappingsUpdater.MappingUpdateVisitor.getNodeCandidates(..) at first
when we try to determine which mappings apply and then through
DDiagramSynchronizer.addNowNodeCandidates(..) when the algorithm compare
the "before" and "now" states.

On a decent sized diagram (3K diagram elements) profiling reveals 3698
calls to evaluateCandidateExpression(). This patch introduce a cache,
valid for the duration of a Session, for mappings which are synchronized
to reduce this amount of call to 1849. This improves the performances in
many cases by not having two evaluations of queries during a single
refresh and gets even more visible with complex queries.

One could be tempted to go "the extra mile" and have this cache enabled
based on the semantic candidate expression itself and not the mapping,
this would lead to "sharing" the same result for different mapping and
an even better performance improvement. It would also be more risky (and
as we are close to the release I did not go this way) as some VSMs might
rely on the order of evaluation of such queries and on the fact that
refreshing some mapping might have changed the diagram content before
the current expression is being evaluated.

Cédric, if one semantic candidates expression depends on the diagram state: the result will be different between the two evaluation points.

Indeed, and that's a major pitfall in this situation. This patchset is not going to work cases where a semantic candidate expressions is based on any diagram content *and assume the refresh of some other mappings* has been done already. And as much as I'd like this to be extremely rare it is not in practice.
Checking for the use of "diagram" or "containerView" variables is not going to be enough neither as there are so many ways to retrieve the diagram content even starting from the semantic content.

Line:441, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/internal/experimental/sync/DDiagramSynchronizer.java -> maybe those clearCaches-methods should be done in the finally to avoid memory leaks if an exception is raised.
