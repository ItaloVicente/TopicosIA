DESCRIPTION:

[427869] Remove DeleteDiagramElementsTriggerOperation mechanism

DeleteDiagramElementsTriggerOperation to remove diagram elements and
diagrams themselves which target semantic elements that were deleted by
the external action. We do this in a rather inefficient way:
* it uses a ChangeListener which installs a ContentAdapter on the model;
* the ChangeListener keeps in memory all added/removed/modified
elements;
* after the task's execution we use APIs like
TaskHelper.getDElementToClearFromSemanticElements() which iterate on all
the content of the representation models;
* if a tool executes N different Java actions, we do all of this N
times...

In addition, what this task does is inconsistent with what happens for
other tasks (that use pure ModelOperations):
* it does not take into account the "Automatic Refresh" setting (which
is bad);
* it removes representations whose target element has been removed
(which is good, and should probably be generalized).

The IExternalJavaAction2 interface should also be removed: it was
introduced only to allow for implementers to explicitly declare when
their actions do not delete any element so that we can avoid the costly
DeleteDiagramElementsTriggerOperation in these cases.

+2 for the actual code changes, but it looks like there was a problem with the refresh of the HTML version of the doc/release notes.
Line:20, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release Notes.textile -> It looks like the HTML version of the release notes was not refreshed as part of this commit.

Line:32, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/release_notes_vp.html -> Strange that this file would change (with not change in the corresponding source).
