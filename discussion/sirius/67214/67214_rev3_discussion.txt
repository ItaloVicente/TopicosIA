Line:188, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/DiagramPlugin.java -> Not saying it's wrong, but why is this needed here? What is so special about this new constraint (which is essentially !representationDescripton.getMetamodels().isEmpty()) that requires this that was not needed before?

Line:269, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/plugin.xml -> Bug #493330 calls for a warning.

It seems too harsh to raise an error in this first step (for 4.0), until we have more reasons to justify the constraint and more/better tooling to help specifiers.

Line:100, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/validation/AbstractConstraint.java -> Seems strange to have this here in the middle of an abstract class, as the code is only one in one concrete subclass. Or maybe it is in preparation for later patches on the subjec?

Line:61, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/validation/description/constraints/RepresentationDescriptionMetaModelsConstraint.java -> "odesign" is a legacy name, kept in the file extension for compatibily reasons, but the proper name we should use now to designate it is VMS.

Line:120, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/internal/validation/description/constraints/RepresentationDescriptionMetaModelsConstraint.java -> This part is out of scope of bug #493330, and at first glance it would only work for VSM which are loaded from already deployed bundles (i.e. not in the workspace), for which we never launch validation (and the scope of #4993330 is about "specifiers", so validation launched from the VSM editor on a VSM begin authored).
