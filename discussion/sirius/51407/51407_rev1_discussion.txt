Agreed on the change, but technically an API break, so must be documented in the release notes (plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.textile).

We may wait after 3.1 to merge this. While there is relatively little chance that this would break client code, this is still an API break, and given that the only benefit is to be just a little cleaner, the risk, while small, outwheigh the even smaller benefit.

For 3.1 we could simply deprecated the constant.

Given the fact that we already have reviews with API breaks waiting and more incoming (I have at least one more for today ready to be contributed), we were waiting for Eclipse Mars to be released. Is it possible today to contribute code on the master branch for the release of Sirius for Eclipse Neon M1, with API breaks? or is the master branch dedicated to the work on Eclipse Mars SR1? If this is the case, when will we be able to contribute potential API breaks in Sirius for Eclipse Neon? After Eclipse Mars SR1? SR2?

I can make the change in the release notes but if it is not the time to start contributing to Sirius for Eclipse Neon, I'll wait before working on additional API change tasks.
