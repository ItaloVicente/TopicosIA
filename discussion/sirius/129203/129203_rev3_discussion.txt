DESCRIPTION:

[535648] Improve Link Note delete lifecycle

Link notes are no longer automatically deleted when the linked
representation is deleted. This prevents unnecessary locks in
collaborative sirius and the user won't lose the note text. If
a linked representation is deleted, the note will indicate that
it was linked to a representation that has been deleted.

3rd patch is only formatting. Btw, thanks for providing the oomph setup, it's so much easier for contributors with this.

Weird that there's a different failing test in ps 3 given that it's only whitespace changes. Can we retrigger the build?

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2

The move to an eAnnotation does not change the problem identified by Laurent Redor: if I have a link note on diagram D1 targeting a diagram D2, when user deletes Diagram D2, the current behavior is to delete the reference to D2 on the eannotation in the D1 diagram : so D1 is modified which might not be possible on collaborative context (or on a more simple context with two airdfragments and D1 fragments in readonly for example)

It seems that for both implementations with the element targeting the other diagram or the eannotation, we need to relaxe the DanglingRefRemovalTrigger to avoid to clean those links and accept proxy/dangling refererence for link note. 

The eannotation case allow to differentiate link note from note i otherwise a link note whose element would be set to null will be identified a a standard note. Si it seems that the current implementation is safer than the previous one with note.element direclty set to the targeted diagram.

But the dangling reference was already handled by org.eclipse.sirius.business.internal.session.danalysis.DanglingRefRemovalTrigger.NOTATION_VIEW_ELEMENT_REFERENCE_TO_IGNORE_PREDICATE, now you must complete the DanglingRefRemovalTrigger with a predicate which relaxe the cleaning for your linked note annotation references

A migration participant is also needed to migrate existing link notes.

I am not sure I understand why this 'might' not be possible? I tested this with Team4Capella and this works. Which other contexts do I have to test?

But If I understand you, you don't want to ever set it to null, but keep a proxy reference. The only time it will be cleared is when the linknote itself is deleted. So I don't get this point.

What I mean to say is that if keeping the proxy-ref is really required as you say, then an eAnnotation intermediate isn't needed.

I see two contexts: Team for Capella and Capella with fragmented models (two diagrams from two different .airdfragments) on Clearcase (as deployed for some users).
You must have the same behavior than Sirius in manual refresh for diagram element with its "red crosses" when semantic elements have been deleted: 
 - A model with 2 diagrams. Diagram_1 has a link note referencing Diagram_2 (in file mode put them in two different airdfragments)
 - Delete Diagram_2. 
 _ With the Team add-on, it must not take a lock on Diagram_1, and if Diagram_1 was already locked by another user, the Diagram_2 deletion must not be forbidden
 - In file mode:  save. The aird fragment containing Diagram_1 must not be modified (check the file or use git)

 To allow this, you must not clean the eannotation but keep the proxy reference to the deleted diagram.
 That's why I gave you the pointer to DanglingRefRemovalTrigger (and some hints) in a preceding comment to allow Sirius to relax its cleaning.

My remark was more for other reviewer, as I understand the thing, the eannotation allows to differentiate a link note from a standard note. 
Without the eannotation, if some user action leads to having an element set to null, the note will then considered as a note, whereas with the eannotation it would be always identified as a link note.

Without the eannotation, if the cleaning is relaxed, we would have the element reference set (to a proxy) even when the referenced diagram is deleted, so the update action, label/style, edit part selection might continue to successfully identify the note as a link note. Additional bonus: no need for a migration.

For information, we have a deadline tomorrow for Sirius 6.1.0 RC4. Ideally, this gerrit must be merged today, to allow a cherry-pick on Sirius master and to be included in this version.
So it would be great if you have the time to fix it today.

I created a new change that uses the discussed approach here: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/130127/
I don't want to abandon this one yet though, might need to come back to it.

I have almost no contract time left to work on this. (I will try to help as good as I can in free time..), so here's a resume:

1) The patch in this form works fine with Team4 Capella, even if the annotation->representation reference is cleared and the referencing diagram is locked. Based on this test, I do not see the need to enhance the dangling href removal trigger to exclude this reference. Implementing the exclusion is almost trival, but I want to see a test that demonstrates why it is really needed.

2) Even if we avoid clearing the reference during deletion, it is cleared automatically during save. That means that a read only aird fragment which contains a diagram link note with a dangling ref to a deleted representation will be modified on save, so that's no argument to keep a dangling ref either.

3) This solution still requires a migration.
