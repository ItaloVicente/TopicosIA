Line:5, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.ext.widgets.reference/model/properties-ext-widgets-reference.ecore -> I would name it directly ReferenceDescription the "Ext" prefix can be weird for a specifier, he does'nt car if it is provided by EEF or Sirius. And so as we discuss before I would break the previous Reference Description to enrich other widgets with buttons and then remove it.

Line:106, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties/schema/descriptionConverter.exsd -> Example is missing

Line:106, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties/schema/descriptionLinkResolver.exsd -> Example is missing

Line:5, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.ext.widgets.reference/model/properties-ext-widgets-reference.ecore -> Agreed

Line:8, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.ext.widgets.reference/model/properties-ext-widgets-reference.ecore -> This does not really correspond to what is usually named "semanticCandidateExpression". Proposal: "referenceOwnerExpression" or "referenceHolderExpression"

Line:83, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.ui.properties/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/ui/properties/internal/converters/ConverterTests.java -> Should be commented-out by default.

Line:24, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/properties/api/DescriptionCache.java -> To me the name "cache" would imply we're storing the result of some expensive computation to amortize its cost. It does not seem to correspond to what this is.

Line:48, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/properties/api/IDescriptionConverter.java -> entered (or registered)

Line:55, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/properties/internal/tabprovider/AbstractDescriptionConverter.java -> Is this variable name relevant (for some reason I'm missing)? Or should it be more general?

Line:61, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/properties/internal/tabprovider/DefaultDescriptionWithInitialOperationConverter.java -> Shouldn't we break/return after this instead of going on and calling the super.convertEReference()?

Line:5, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.ext.widgets.reference/model/properties-ext-widgets-reference.ecore -> I almost entirely disagree.



The prefix "Ext" is used everywhere in order to establish a naming conventions for non standard widgets contributed by the various extension mechanisms. I agree that the specifier should not see the difference, that's why I changed the name in the plugin.properties (and I believed it should be changed there) using "Reference [ext]" instead of "ExtReferenceDescription". I agree that the suffix "[ext]" should maybe disappear but today we would have two reference widgets with the same and icons. I would change "Reference [ext]" to "Reference" when we are done with the removal of the existing reference widget because if we don't do it, for example for a lack of time, we would have two identical widgets with different behaviors (we won't do the removal of the existing widget in the same review because it will be quite large). I would agree that maybe today "Reference [ext]" sucks as a name (^^') and it could be replaced by "Simple Reference" or something like that right now but it is not related to the name of the EClass.



I disagree on the fact that the name of the EClass should because of the specifier. This name is not for the specifier, she/he will never see see this EClass, only developers will see it and it has been selected in order to keep a consistent naming conventions (including with EEF) for developers who will create custom widgets and/or who will try to manipulate it with IDescriptionConverters, IDescriptionLinkResolvers or IEEFLifecycleManagerProviders.

Line:8, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.properties.ext.widgets.reference/model/properties-ext-widgets-reference.ecore -> Let's go with referenceOwnerExpression then. I will make the change in EEF too.

Line:83, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tests.ui.properties/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tests/ui/properties/internal/converters/ConverterTests.java -> Done

Line:106, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties/schema/descriptionConverter.exsd -> I was waiting to code it and then I forgot :D

Line:106, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties/schema/descriptionLinkResolver.exsd -> I was waiting to code it and then I forgot :D

Line:24, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/properties/api/DescriptionCache.java -> Computing again the link between the Sirius element and the EEF element would be a quite expensive and complex computation...

Line:48, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/properties/api/IDescriptionConverter.java -> Done

Line:55, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/properties/internal/tabprovider/AbstractDescriptionConverter.java -> Nope, refactoring issue :)

Line:61, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.properties/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/properties/internal/tabprovider/DefaultDescriptionWithInitialOperationConverter.java -> Indeed :)
