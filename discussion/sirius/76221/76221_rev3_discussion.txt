DESCRIPTION:

DRAFT_JMA [496985] Tests to reveal problem of DnD of a regions container 

Unlike classical container, when a regions container is drag'n'drop from
a container to another one, it loses is size. This is probably due to
the layout specificity of the regions container (always in {-1, -1}, the
dimension is handled by its region children. 

Steps to reproduce: 
* Open VStackDiag with DnD 
* Dnd "cccc" from "aaaa" in diagram 
* KO: The new "cccc" container is auto-sized.
