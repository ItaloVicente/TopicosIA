Missing: technical details about how the actual service resolution will work.
Line:27, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/471900_openServiceImplementation/471900_openServiceImplementation.textile -> org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.ElementListSelectionDialog seems like a good candidate to reuse.

Line:35, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/471900_openServiceImplementation/471900_openServiceImplementation.textile -> Typo: EO[b]ject

Line:36, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/471900_openServiceImplementation/471900_openServiceImplementation.textile -> You'll also need the EAttribute corresponding to the expression, as a given EObject in the VSM may have several interpreted expressions (e.g. semanticCandiates and preconditionExpression), which will not always be invoked in the same context (possible types for "self", available variables and their types), and thus will no give the same service method resolution.

All in all, an triplet with:
* an EObject
* an EAttribute which refers to one of its attributes
* the actual value of the attribute
corresponds to an existing concept/type: EStructuralFeature.Setting.

It's probably better to reuse a well-known existing concept than to mulitply the number of arguments in the method.

Line:38, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/471900_openServiceImplementation/471900_openServiceImplementation.textile -> Why not reuse existing types from the platform/JDT, like ISourceReference?

Line:45, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/471900_openServiceImplementation/471900_openServiceImplementation.textile -> Not sure about the wording of the messages, but this can be tweaked later when the mechanism itself works.

Line:68, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/471900_openServiceImplementation/471900_openServiceImplementation.textile -> Precision: either in the "Properties" view or in the multi-line edition dialog (even though opening the multi-line dialog is probably overkill for a service: invocation, but it will become useful when we extend this to AQL expressions).
