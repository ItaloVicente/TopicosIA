DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Migrate NSURis from Viewpoint to Sirius

This commit adds a new migration participant which maps
nsURIs of all the Sirius EPackage with their current value.

In doing so, the IMigrationParticipant contract is revised so that
a participant can provide an EPackage instance from a nsURI.

Pending points :
* which version is meaningful ? is that the version of the .odesign
file format ? or the version of Viewpoint/Sirius itself?
Right now I declared my participant to the 7.0 version so that
it gets picked post 6.9.
* should I hardcode the nsURI target strings or directly use the
nsURI field on the EPackage implementation ?
Right now I used harcoded strings as it makes it easier : they are
all in one place, I don't have to split the participant for table and
tree.

Implementation can't be tested correctly right now as the metamodel
is in a broken state since the renaming (ownedSiriuss references...)

You added a MigrationParticipant for VSM, but nothing for representation files. The representation files have the same problem of migration.
This is perhaps due to the WIP state of this commit.
File Comment: plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/AbstractSiriusMigrationService.java -> Could you firstly make a commit just with formatting? It's difficult to see the difference in this class.
