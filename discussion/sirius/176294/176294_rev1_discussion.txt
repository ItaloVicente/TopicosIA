DESCRIPTION:

[570055] Update IconRefreshTests for this bug

This commit reveals the problem. The job is expected to fail on
org.eclipse.sirius.tests.unit.api.refresh.IconRefreshTests.

For that, in this commit:
* The VSM has been updated to add a conditional style to reveal the
problem. The style under the conditional style is exactly the same.
* The VSM has been updated to add a Node with label on border to confirm
that the problem is only for border node with label on border.
* The semantic model has been fixed (it was wrong).
* The diagram of the aird file has just been refreshed.
