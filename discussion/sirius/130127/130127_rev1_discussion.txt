DESCRIPTION:

[535648] Improve Link Note Lifecycle

Link notes are no longer automatically deleted when the linked
representation is deleted. This prevents unnecessary locks in
collaborative sirius and the user won't lose the note text. If
a linked representation is deleted, the note will indicate that
it was linked to a representation that has been deleted.

AFAIU: There's no need to touch the dangling href removal trigger, because as you said it already has a predicate to leave the view-->element reference untouched. The problem was that the delete representation command already cleared this reference by using SiriusUtil.delete before the trigger gets its chance to keep it.

This patch works without an intermediate EAnnotation, because I can distinguish between notes, deleted notes and undeleted notes by looking at the 'isSet' flag for the element reference. 

However, there is one problem I can't solve yet: Since the ref is now untouched, there are 0 events that would cause a refresh of the notes visuals if the referencing diagram is opened => One has to close/open the referencing diagram for the labels to change. Even a manual refresh doesn't trigger the delete label/icon to appear.

Another thing is that I still need to test this in Team, and I fear it won't work because Laurent mentioned a customized implementation of ViewImpl. If it doesn't work, then I need to combine this solution with the EAnnotation approach.

... and that is why the swt bot tests still fail. They expect the refresh to happen immediately.

I will review this new gerrit as soon as possible. For the "refresh", you can look at the org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.edit.internal.part.EditStatusUpdater that is used to "add" the red cross.

I tested in collab environment and proposed some changes.

The lifecyle is improved but the refresh of the icon/label is problematic.

Line:55, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/edit/parts/SiriusDiagramNameCompartmentEditPart.java -> I think that this icon should be changed as it is not adapted. Maybe the "representation" icon with overlay a broken chain (like https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/1093502/broken_chain_cutting_disconnect_freedom_link_icon). But it could be changed later.

So I think that the remaining work is to:
* integrate my propotions (if they are OK for you)
* add a mechanism (postcommit listener or something like that to refresh the NoteEditPart when its diagram is deleted)
* maybe to change the label and the icon (when the shortcut is broken)

Is the eIsProxy() check to make it work in team? In sirius classic, .aird resources discard dangling hrefs on save, so I can't see a case where eIsProxy() would be true? Btw, to debug this in team, can I just use the same org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui source plugin, or is it patched for team/closed source?

It's not clear to me how we can now distinguish between a 'normal' note and a deleted link note in team (without falling back to use the eAnnotation helper construct)

Yes, "org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui" is the same in team.
I tried to comment the code to explain the specific code for team environment. But it seems that it is not clear enough.

But you have to test it both in Sirius and team environment.

Do you not see that there's an ambiguity: 

A note with an unset element,

Okay thanks. I will test in both environments and get back to you. I still need to do some guesswork in team, because as it was said before, you seem to have implemented some 'tweaks' in the team version of getElement() which I don't have access to :/

Ok so here is the ambiguity:

In team, a normal note is one with an unset element (after the server restarts) But the same is true for a dangling note after the model is saved and reloaded, because AirdResourceFactory has this option set:
XMIResource.OPTION_PROCESS_DANGLING_HREF_DISCARD. When a model with a dangling link note is saved, the elem ref is discarded and we can no longer distinguish between a dangling link note and a normal note.

Side note: If dangling refs are discarded on save, the underlying file will change no matter what. IMO, for vanilla sirius, the read-only-fragment use case is effectively invalid because of that.

OK, so for the ambiguity, I've not verified but I trust you. So to remove this ambiguity, you could just add an EAnnotation to the Note by overridden org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.internal.view.factories.SiriusNoteViewFactory.decorateView(View, View, IAdaptable, String, int, boolean) and maybe reuse the ViewQuery.SPECIFIC_STYLES source key. This new data can then be used in SiriusNoteEditPart.isLinkNote()

Yes, ok. I already did so in the other patch (https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/129203/3/plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src-diag/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/internal/view/factories/SiriusNoteViewFactory.java). Is it better to override decorateView() or createView() like I did in the other patch? If I use this existing source key, are there no unwanted side effects?

I think decorateView() is better, as it is called during the createView(). I you override createView(), the code is called after decorateView().

> If I use this existing source key, are there no unwanted side effects?

This source key is already a Sirius specific key. So we can considered is as safe.

This solution doesn't work with CDO/Team. When the view->element reference is cleared (and it is cleared, even with this patch which tries to keep it), the DiagramNameCompartmentEditPart will be hidden (instead of showing the "Deleted Representation Message"). This is due to the special implementation of View.getElement() in combination with. DiagramNameCompartEditPart.setVisible().

Hi Félix, 

This should be handled specifically in org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.internal.edit.parts.SiriusDiagramNameCompartmentEditPart  -> with Laurent's proposal it will be possibile to know that we are on a linked note + with element == null

Yes, but if you look at the superclass implementation DiagramNameCompartmentEditPart.setVisible(), I don't see a way to 'unhide' it without having to copy the base implementation...
