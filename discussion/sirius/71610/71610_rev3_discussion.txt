activateMetamodels is called on ModelAccessor.
- Change notifyNewMetamodels to register MM in Sirius Interpreter
- add tests

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-2

With bug #481849 we're moving towards an approach with less "magic" where Sirius tries to approximate which MMs are needed, and instead encourage/force specifiers to be explicit in which MMs they need. If Sirius would continue to try to infer which MMs should be enabled based on completetly different sources, why would specifiers bother with configuring anything?

Anyway, the more global issue about which MMs are registered/visible at any point in time and in code is a very complex one. It's too late in the 4.0 cycle to change things in a way that may be reverted in a later version once we have thought more about it. I'll move this ticket to 4.1, where it may or may not be implemented, but at least it will be used as a source of concrete data to fuel the discussion about what should be done.

In addition, as mentioned in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=479726#c10, the code proposed here is only an approximation, true at a specific time but maybe not later.
