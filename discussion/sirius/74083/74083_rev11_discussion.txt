DESCRIPTION:

[493367] Display RepDescriptor in model explorer and change actions

* model explorer displays DRepresentationDescriptor instead of
DRepresentation
* Action (open, move, delete, rename, export, extract) are changed to
adapt to DRepresentationDescriptor (the EMF Command associated to the
action is not changed)
* Add DialectUIServices.canHandle(DRepresentationDescriptor) and change
DialectUIManager.canExport(DRepresentation) to
DialectUIManager.canExport(DRepresentationDescriptor) to support
ExportAction availability

Line:66, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/dialect/DialectUIManager.java -> Here canExport is modified to work with a DRepresentationDescriptor instead of a DRepresentation. Why isn't it a new method instead? In DialectUIServices, you added a new method for canHandle with a DRepresentationDescriptor as parameter.

Line:240, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/dialect/DialectUIServices.java -> the given representation. -> the given representation descriptor.

Line:135, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/actions/export/AbstractExportRepresentationsAction.java -> Shouldn't the ExportAction constructor take a list of DRepresentationDescriptor instead of DRepresentation now?

Line:65, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/action/DeleteRepresentationAction.java -> If the representation descriptors are also deleted that should be "the representation descriptors and their representations to delete". If not then it should be "hold the representations to delete"

Line:66, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/dialect/DialectUIManager.java -> yes it makes sense to keep export with DRepresentation signature

Line:240, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/dialect/DialectUIServices.java -> Done

Line:243, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/dialect/DialectUIServices.java -> no I meant represents the represention because DRepDescriptor is only a technical object. 
It is more important to speak about the associated representation.

Line:244, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/dialect/DialectUIServices.java -> idem

Line:97, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/actions/export/AbstractExportRepresentationsAction.java -> I prefer to keep Representation because it reprensets more than RepDesc what is physically behind. RepDesc is a technical object

Line:115, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/actions/export/AbstractExportRepresentationsAction.java -> changed "represents" the representation to export

Line:135, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/actions/export/AbstractExportRepresentationsAction.java -> No because, it is not necessary and above all it is really the representation we want to export and not the RespDesc.
Note that ExportAction is actually not an eclipse action but a WorkspaceModifyOperation. It is not to mixup with ExportRepresentationsAction

Line:84, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/actions/export/ExportRepresentationsAction.java -> see remark in AbstractExportRepresentationsAction

Line:200, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/SessionWrapperContentProvider.java -> Done

Line:316, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/SessionWrapperContentProvider.java -> Done

Line:194, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/action/DeleteRepresentationAction.java -> for the context of this ticket we keep the permission authority test on DRepresentation as DRepresentation is still owned by th DView.
In then further commit we'll switch test on DRDescriptor

Line:80, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/action/ExtractRepresentationAction.java -> Not necessary in the scope of this bug.It will be done in further commits.
The context of this bug is only to create and link the lifecyle of DRep with a DRDesc, make the Navigator based on DRDesc and to keep iso functionnal

Line:93, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/action/MoveRepresentationAction.java -> Ditto as ExtractRepresentationAction and ExportAction too :)

Line:2, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/navigator/OpenRepresentationListener.java -> Done

Line:36, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/navigator/filter/DanglingRepresentationCommonFilter.java -> Yes some clients could display a DRep in their own navigator
done
