DESCRIPTION:

[510040] Synchronization of session's editor state and session state

- Refactored ViewpointSelectionWizard page to have graphical components
in another class ViewpointSelectionGraphicalHandler. It allows to reuse
this components in other contexts.
- Created a new class DynamicVIewpointSelectionComponent using
ViewpointSelectionGraphicalHandler. This nerw class is used by the
session's editor default page to handle viewpoint
activation/deactivation dynamically whenever changes occurs either in
the session or in the graphical component.
- Add handling of save operation and dirty status for session's editor.
- Add a new interface IViewpointSelectionCallbackListener allowing to
provide a listener to ViewpointSelectionCallbackWithConfimation to be
warn about such cancellation
- Fix missing scrollbar when opening session editor from contextual
menu.
- Fix wrong viewpoint activation status when initializing viewpoint
block of the session's editor.

Line:87, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/SessionEditor.java -> Why not worked(2) direclty?

Line:1, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/viewpoint/IViewpointSelectionCallbackListener.java -> * Missing copyright header.
* This should probably be kept internal.

Line:53, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/viewpoint/ViewpointSelectionCallbackWithConfimation.java -> Does it make sense to allow instanciating this without a listener?

Line:159, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/api/wizards/page/ViewpointsSelectionWizardPage.java -> The whole class is API, so all these removals are API breaks and should be documented.

Line:87, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/SessionEditor.java -> better is to remove it. It is an artefact from previous test. My monitor only has one unit so I can only do one worked

Line:1, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/viewpoint/IViewpointSelectionCallbackListener.java -> It cannot be internal because this class is exposed in a new constructor of ViewpointSelectionCallbackWithConfimation  that is already API

Line:53, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/viewpoint/ViewpointSelectionCallbackWithConfimation.java -> Yes, no listener is needed when deselecting by using the wizard available with right click because the wizard is closed and we do not have to uncheck a checkbox. SO this is two distinct mods. I could remove it and replace the call to this constructor with the new and a null listener but it is API so maybe we are not the only one to use this constructor. So I don't think we should remove this constructor.

Line:159, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/api/wizards/page/ViewpointsSelectionWizardPage.java -> Some of the method removed had been added in previous session editor patch so they never was really API.
But it was indeed missing two protected method that was never meant to be removed. With the review patch, this class has the exact same protected and public methods so no changes to the release not should be made.
