A bunch of comments, but don't feel overwhelmed by those, these are actually pretty simple changes, pretty much always representing the same feedback.
1- use the mechanisms setup by EMF to support standalone execution when possible (notably the EMFPlugin pattern)
2- abstract calls to the platform in specific class which will have the "right behavior in standalone" : this will be way more sustainable even in the medium term as we won't rely on "the hope that some of the platform stuff is not called in the wrong context" or "the developper made sure to call Platform.isRunning()".

Please note that the standalone support has been investigated as part of the Bug 440865 which capture a bit of information regarding this task.
Line:246, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.common/src/org/eclipse/sirius/common/tools/api/resource/ResourceSetSync.java -> Same remark as in ViewpointRegistryImpl

Line:252, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.common/src/org/eclipse/sirius/common/tools/api/util/EclipseUtil.java -> Same remark as in ViewpointRegistryImpl

Line:151, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/componentization/ViewpointRegistryImpl.java -> we should probably mimic EcorePlugin.getWorkspaceRoot() in a dedicated class instead of relying on an exception and making sure we update all the calless through the code base.

It checks for the ResourcesBundle being available and/or a specific property "org.eclipse.emf.ecore.plugin.EcorePlugin.doNotLoadResourcesPlugin"

Line:68, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/session/AbstractSavingPolicy.java -> same remark as in ViewpointRegistry

Line:103, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/session/danalysis/DAnalysisSelectorService.java -> Instead of removing log entries we should make sure the log will work in standalone too. An easy way to achieve this is by making SiriusPlugin an EMFPlugin and adopt the same pattern EMF does, then we'll be sure the log is not failing in standalone and will have the proper behavior.

Line:76, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/AbstractSiriusMigrationService.java -> Here again, instead of scattering the code with if() statements, it would be more robust to have a wrapper method replacing all the calls to "Platform.getExtensionRegistry().getConfigurationElementsFor" which does the check and then return an empty table if the platform is not running.

Line:192, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/SessionManagerImpl.java -> Same remark as in the MigrationService

Line:1017, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DAnalysisSessionImpl.java -> Same remark as the removed log entry, SiriusPlugin should be an EMFPlugin.

Line:56, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/ResourceSaveDiagnose.java -> How is that related to the change to make the code work in standalone ?

Line:282, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/SessionResourcesSynchronizer.java -> Why did this go away ? How is that related to the standalone support?

Line:232, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/api/ui/RefreshEditorsPrecommitListener.java -> If you don't want to be blocked two steps further down the road, every call to Platform.getPreferencesService should be replaced by a dedicated method which will do the actual Platform.isRunning() check and have a sensible behavior in standalone (get the preference values from system properties ?)

Line:282, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/SessionResourcesSynchronizer.java -> This allows to do session saving with session resource URI being a file URI.

Line:232, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tools/api/ui/RefreshEditorsPrecommitListener.java -> Doing that in Sirius for all call to Platform.getPreferencesService() it to many works to have my test SaverTest works in standalone. This call is the single one which forbid me to do session creation/opening in standalone.
