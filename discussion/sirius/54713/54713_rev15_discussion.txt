DESCRIPTION:

[478080] Trigger SaveSessionWhenNoDialectEditorsListener in postcommit

Transform the SaveSessionWhenNoDialectEditorsListener into a post-commit
listener, in doing so :
- it gets triggered when the Session has finished processing all its
events from the workspace
- it doesn't have to analyze individual resource change events to detect
if the project is being renamed/moved/deleted
- it can directly ask for the session status (SYNC or DIRTY) and decide
upon that.

Bug: 478080

-1 even if the code seems technically ok: 
 .  CloseWithoutSavingTest is related to save, the error might be caused by the current change
 . The bugzilla is for 4.0.0, do not merge before branch 3.1.x is created.

Indeed the failure of CloseWithoutSavingTest is related to this change and can only be fixed by having a ReloadPolicy which limit the number of transactions during a reload. This is addressed by the next commit which has code not readable enough for my taste, I'll revert the order of the commit once this is cleared.
