DESCRIPTION:

[442337] Fix regression in representation change detection

The previous change in Ic5cbfa8d82d95a34b1ca4af216b3a468c9fe61a1 caused
a regression in the detection of representations creation and deletion,
with the modeling explorer which was not udpated in some cases, for
example when copying a representation from the context menu.

Before the change, when a representation is added or removed the
RepresentationChangeAdapter triggered an update in the UI, which called
back DialectManager.getRepresentations() to find the representations to
show in the tree. Because the old implementation of getRepresentations()
looked directly inside the ownedViews reference (which was just updated,
this is what triggers the adapter), it found the newly created
representation, which appeared in the UI.

After the change, when the UI refresh calls back
DialectManager.getRepresentations(), the cross-referencer that we use in
the new implementation has not yet been updated, because it appears
after the RepresentationChangeAdapter in the eAdapters() list. The newly
created representation is not seen, and does not appear in the UI.

The solution is to convert the RepresentationChangeAdapter into a
ModelChangeTrigger called on pre-commit, after all the model changes
have been done, and after the cross-referencer is up to date. This has
the side-benefits of avoiding the installation (and maintenance) of yet
another Adapter, and of triggering the UI refresh only after we have
reached a stable state. The notifications are still done in pre-commit
instead of post-commit, as existing code which listens for
SessionListener events may assume they are inside a transaction and try
to inspect and/or change the model.

There are still some open questions and potential regressions with this
version regarding the number of notifications we should send if several
representations where created or deleted, and regarding the behavior in
the case of a rollback or undo.
