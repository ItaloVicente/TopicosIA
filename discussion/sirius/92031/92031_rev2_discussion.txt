The current APIs for Viewpoint selection is a mess. I'd like to have the opportunity to re-design them properly at some point, but in the meantime I'd rather avoid exposing even more "ad hoc" things as APIs.

OK for introducing the listeners we need to react to the changes, but them should be kept as internal. We export all our packages (in terms of OSGi visiblity), so "internal" does not mean we can not use it from our own other plug-ins, just that we do not expose them to client code, and keep the option of modifying them without warning as we see fit.
Line:22, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.textile -> Typo: "dialog".

Line:253, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/DefaultSessionEditorPage.java -> It's not enough to initialize this once. Viewpoints can appear and disappear dynamically (e.g. the ones defined in the workspace).

Line:445, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/viewpoint/ViewpointSelection.java -> The method is static: I'd rather have it moved in a separate helper, kept in internal. We can still use it ourselves from the other plug-in but this avoid publishing an API that is not particularly well designed).

Line:22, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/doc/Release_Notes.textile -> Done

Line:253, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/DefaultSessionEditorPage.java -> True but I prefer to fix the problem in next patch were I already fix some other problems related to viewpoint block.

Line:445, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/viewpoint/ViewpointSelection.java -> Done
