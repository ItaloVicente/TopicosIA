Line:39, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/435507_SnapToGridForCreation/435507.textile -> We could mention here the possibility to create/correct a bug to properly disable the SnapToGrid on Sequence diagrams.

Line:70, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/435507_SnapToGridForCreation/435507.textile -> Note that the scroll on diagram has no impact on the grid: the scroll shift the diagram and its grid (the srcoll pane contains the diagram figure and its grid layer).

Line:119, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/435507_SnapToGridForCreation/435507.textile -> We should make attention to avoid any disturbing effect: after the node creation, the scroll bars should not be reset. Even if the scroll is not really considered, the node should be created on the closest grid crossing, but the real location is a scrolled one (current behavior), we have just to align the location to the global grid.

Line:123, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/435507_SnapToGridForCreation/435507.textile -> Note that if the container is in auto size mode, it will be automattically resized (it is true without the snap to grid creation).

Line:127, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/435507_SnapToGridForCreation/435507.textile -> I think the "needed. The impacted" should be replaced by "needed, the impacted". 

I propose an other formulation:
If the centered in visible part creation (marked as known limitation) is finally needed, the impacted code ...

Line:39, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/435507_SnapToGridForCreation/435507.textile -> I added this in "limits" section.

Line:70, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/435507_SnapToGridForCreation/435507.textile -> added

Line:119, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/435507_SnapToGridForCreation/435507.textile -> added

Line:123, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/435507_SnapToGridForCreation/435507.textile -> NOK. This sentence is confusing. The container is not automatically resized to align the created node to the first grid crossing.

Line:127, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/draft/435507_SnapToGridForCreation/435507.textile -> Done
