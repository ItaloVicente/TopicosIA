See the indivudual comments. Most are just style issues and not that important, but I'd like at least the ones about the helper code moved to EReferenceCustomizationValuePropertySection.java and DAnalysisSessionImpl.java to be addressed. The more the better.
Line:77, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.common.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/common/ui/tools/api/profiler/view/TimeProfiler2ViewLabelProvider.java -> Is this an artefact of the Gerrit UI or is the formatting broken here? I see a ");" by itself at the beginning of line 78 which should be at the end of line 77.

Line:120, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.common/src/org/eclipse/sirius/common/tools/internal/interpreter/ServiceInterpreter.java -> The error message is incomplete. It is not a full sentence and does not explain what the problem is. It should probably be something like "The receiver of the service call " + serviceCall + " is not an EObject."

Line:103, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/specific/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/internal/migration/SetGMFViewsToNillMigrationParticipant.java -> org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.diagram.core.util.ViewType.{NOTE,TEXT,NOTE_ATTACHMENT} can be used instead of hard-coding the strings. Unless we expect these to change in future versions of GMF (as the whole pour here is to use the names from the version we migrate from).

Line:155, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/properties/sections/description/ereferencecustomization/EReferenceCustomizationValuePropertySection.java -> Useless javadoc block for a trivial inline Function.

Line:199, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/properties/sections/description/ereferencecustomization/EReferenceCustomizationValuePropertySection.java -> These helper are completely general and have no reason to be hidden inside a PropertySection class. If they were in a separate class we could write real unit tests for them, but as it is we can't simply tests these non-trivial algorithms.

Line:155, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/session/SessionEditorInput.java -> Maybe it's just me but the combination of a default null value and later a silent catch (which does nothing but relies on the earlier initialization to set the correct value) looks confusing. How about something like this:

final Session sessionFromURI;
try {
   sessionFromURI = ...;
   ...
} catch (IllegalStateException e) {
   sessionFromURI = null;
   // maybe also log the error?
}

This makes it clearer that  "when an error occurs we return null" (IMHO).

Line:120, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/preference/DesignerPreferencePage.java -> "otherwise" instead of "Else", but the wording is confusing anyway.

Line:74, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/query/EClassQuery.java -> Why was this removed from a standalone API class where it could be useful to anyone and tested independently, and (unless I'm mistaken) moved inside a UI class (some PropertySection)?

Line:647, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DAnalysisSessionImpl.java -> See CopyOnWriteArrayList.addAllAbsent() to simply this and make it more robust.

Line:77, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.common.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/common/ui/tools/api/profiler/view/TimeProfiler2ViewLabelProvider.java -> Indeed it's an artefact of the Gerrit UI. During, the review of a file, you can change the "Columns" preference (100 by default).

Nothing has been changed in the code.

Line:120, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.common/src/org/eclipse/sirius/common/tools/internal/interpreter/ServiceInterpreter.java -> Done

Line:103, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/specific/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/internal/migration/SetGMFViewsToNillMigrationParticipant.java -> I replaced the three Strings by the GMF constants. I don't think that the value of these constants will be changed in future versions of GMF (too impacting).

Line:199, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.editor/src-gen/org/eclipse/sirius/editor/properties/sections/description/ereferencecustomization/EReferenceCustomizationValuePropertySection.java -> I split these 3 helper in EClassQuery, EClassesQuery, EStructuralFeaturesQuery.

Line:155, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/business/api/session/SessionEditorInput.java -> I'm agree.
I haven't add an error log because this is not the role of this report commit.

Line:120, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/preference/DesignerPreferencePage.java -> Done

Line:74, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/query/EClassQuery.java -> This has been removed because it is not a query an <code>eClass</code>.
This code has been moved through the review of file EReferenceCustomizationValuePropertySection (see comments on this file for more information). It is now in correct queries.

Line:647, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/session/danalysis/DAnalysisSessionImpl.java -> Done
