DESCRIPTION:

[DRAFT PERF] Avoid doublons calls to permission authority: 

 editInstance is called on the diagram in refreshOperation: no need to
call it in refreshEdgeMapping
 
 editInstance was called at the beginning of refreshBorderNodeMapping
but for containers and non border nodes, it is already called in
refreshOperation for direct diagram children and in
refreshMappingsInContainerMapping for other containment levels. The call
has been moved just before the recursive call of the method to check
each border node only once.
