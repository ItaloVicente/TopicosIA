Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> The variable "view" has been removed from the annotation placed on

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> This variable was never used in the evaluation of these expression and  make no sense in their context. 

Eventually the variable "tree" has been added as available variable for these expression. It was already available at evaluation time, but not exposed in the completion and not known from the validation as they were not declared in the annotations.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> preconditionExpression

or

samantic candidates and precondition expressions

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think you should check org.eclipse.sirius.tree.business.internal.dialect.common.tree.TreeItemMappingExpression.checkPrecondition(EObject, DTreeItemContainer), the variable tree is declared but will always be null as we look for a DTree in the smeantic element ancestors.
