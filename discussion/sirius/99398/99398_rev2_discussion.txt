Now the "link with editor" functionality of the Model Explorer view is
synchronized with aird editor. Selecting a model or an aird element
either in aird editor or Model Explorer will also selecting this element
in the other view.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I currently not reviewed the code but just tested the behavior of this feature. I noticed 2 "bugs":
* when you select a representation in the Models part or the same representation in the Representations part, the item selected in the Model Explorer view is not the same. Is it expected? Of course, I will say no.
* Open the aird editor, open a diagram, split the screen to see both editors, select a item in the diagram (the corresponding item is selected in the Model Explorer view), select another item In the aird editor: KO, the corresponding item is selected quickly but just after, the file is selected.

 Regarding the different selections pointing at different representations, it is working as wanted. The representations bloc represents the model explorer's aird item and its sub item plus the not activated viewpoints. And the models explorer is the exact same content as the one in model explorer so we link these elements between each others.

Regarding the other problem I am working on it.
Line:1, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/.settings/org.eclipse.core.resources.prefs -> no reason other that it was automatically done

Line:526, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/internal/graphicalcomponents/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> I agree it is not a good way. I removed it and modified the equals of ProjectDependenciesItem to always return true when comparing two item of this kind.

Line:975, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui.editor/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/editor/internal/graphicalcomponents/GraphicalSemanticModelsHandler.java -> Done

Line:697, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/graphicalcomponents/GraphicalRepresentationHandler.java -> Done

Line:719, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/graphicalcomponents/GraphicalRepresentationHandler.java -> Done

Line:104, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/item/AnalysisResourceItemImpl.java -> For hashcode it is not needed.
For Equals it is necessary to match object from different viewers that are different instances but show the same item.

Line:115, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/navigator/SessionLinkHelper.java -> Done

Line:199, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/common/navigator/SiriusCommonLabelProvider.java -> To make resource item of models block of aird editor matching resource item of Model explorer, they have to be the same. 

Previously the models block resource items not in project dependencies was not IFile like in Model Explorer but EcoreResourceFactoryImpl. 

I changed that so the linkage can work correctly. Now resources not in project dependencies are IFile.

In Model explorer it is the default label provider of CommonNavigator that was providing label for IFIle not the  SiriusCommonLabelProvider.

In models block of aird editor we only have a SiriusCommonLabelProvider as label provider so I had to add this standard IFile case.

Line:28, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/modelexplorer/ModelExplorerItemComparer.java -> Because it is now done in items implementation with better comparing precision to have a link with editor functionality working without code complexity not needed and potential bug avoidance when dealing with design in workspace and plugin.

Line:33, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/modelexplorer/SelectionProviderDelegator.java -> Well I don't really a need for making it API because this session editor provider can be retrieved generically from editor part with getSite().getSelectionProvider().
So anyone can retrieve selection from session editor just by using this method and register a listener to it also generically thanks to ISelectionProvider interface it implements.

Line:67, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/modelexplorer/SiriusDialectLinkWithEditorSelectionListener.java -> Done

Line:145, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.ui/src/org/eclipse/sirius/ui/tools/internal/views/modelexplorer/SiriusDialectLinkWithEditorSelectionListener.java -> The original code only deals with DialectEditor elements and Model explorer items linking. Not with Session editor linking.

But I modified the code to get things only in the getTargetsFromSelection method
