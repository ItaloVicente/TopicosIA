DESCRIPTION:

[423037] Handle migration

The XMI helpers use the factory instance of the given type to create the
instance and not the given factory when migration is required. 

Modify the NsURIMigrationParticipant to handle the filter package move.
Modify the other participants when needed to adapt their behavior to the
new metamodel structure.

Temporary commit, waiting for review.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Think to change the commit message: "...	Temporary commit, waiting for review."

Line:62, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/internal/migration/DiagramRepresentationsFileMigrationParticipantV690.java -> I think, these changes are only needed because some rebranding were made manually in our test case datas without using the standard migration. Can you confirm?

Line:24, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/DiagramSplitMigrationParticipant.java -> Replace "of th eidagram" by "of the diagram" and "into diagram.ecore" by "into a specific EPackage in viewpoint.ecore"

Line:29, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/DiagramSplitMigrationParticipant.java -> This migration participant is used for VSM and representations file. So it should not extends AbstractVSMMigrationParticipant (use AbstractMigrationParticipant instead).

Line:30, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/NsURIMigrationParticipant.java -> There is problem in this class with "manually rebranded" VSM. For example: org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi.PackageNotFoundException: Package with uri 'http://www.eclipse.org/sirius/description/filter/1.1.0' not found. (platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.sirius.sample.ecore.design/description/ecore.odesign, 6, 87)

This problem should probably not be handled in the code but directly manually changed in concerned VSM.

Line:13, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/description/OptionalLayersVSMMigrationParticipant.java -> See comment of DiagramRepresentationsFileMigrationParticipantV690

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done for next patch set.

Line:62, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/internal/migration/DiagramRepresentationsFileMigrationParticipantV690.java -> I confirm. 
The ...diagram.description.DescriptionPackage case is not really needed as it will be handlded by the super.getType(ePackage, name) in VSMExtendedMatadata.getType(ePackage, name). 
But it allows to be sure that an organize import or a manual modification will not "silently" change viewpoint.description.DescriptionPackage into diagram.description.DescriptionPackage and break the migration. (The automated tests should already detect the case).

Line:24, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/DiagramSplitMigrationParticipant.java -> Done

Line:29, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/DiagramSplitMigrationParticipant.java -> Done

Line:30, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/NsURIMigrationParticipant.java -> This case is handled in another commit, on the local branch I use to launch the automated tests (which contains these manually rebranded VSM). 
I do not plan to push this commit for the moment as this manually rebranded state should not be possible to obtain with a Siriys release. It occurs with VSM manually migrated before the availability of the Viewpoint to Sirius automatic migration which was included in the first public release of Sirius.

Line:13, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/description/OptionalLayersVSMMigrationParticipant.java -> Done

Line:30, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/migration/NsURIMigrationParticipant.java -> OK But currently, if you launch a runtime with the project org.eclipse.sirius.sample.ecore.design, the migration of this last fails.
