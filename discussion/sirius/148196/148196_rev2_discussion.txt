DESCRIPTION:

[550389] Convert Sirius diagram to ELK graph - Wrong node location

There was wrong location of node or container contained in container.
This delta corresponds to the insets of container. It is visible with a
space between the node and the edge in Layout Graph view. There were 2
mistakes:
    * The insets was added to the node, the child, and not to the
container.
    * The location must be set by ignoring the insets. Indeed, the
coordinates of an ElkNode must not considered insets. It is used by the
algorithm only.
