DESCRIPTION:

[427803] Remove dependencies tasks to diagram concepts.

* From ModelOperationTask, we now use
DialectManager.INSTANCE.createTask().
* From ExternalJavaActionTask, we now use
DialectManager.INSTANCE.getDeleteRepresentationTask().
** There is now a default DeleteDRepreentationTask, returned for tree
and table dialect and a specific one (DeleteDDiagramTask) returned for
diagram dialect.

Line:467, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src2/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/business/internal/dialect/DiagramDialectServices.java -> We might ask DiagramTypeDescriptorRegistry.getInstance().getAllDiagramTypeDescriptors() to create the tasks. 

They provide new mapping types, they could provide new ModelOperation.

Line:480, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src2/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/business/internal/dialect/DiagramDialectServices.java -> See previous comment.

Line:69, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/internal/helper/task/DeleteDDiagramTask.java -> We do not create DDiagramLink any more. 
See Bugzilla 427247 which propose to remove these concepts during cleanup.

Line:378, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.table/src/org/eclipse/sirius/table/business/internal/dialect/TableDialectServices.java -> Could you add all /** @inheritDoc */ ?

This could be added in AbstractRepresentationDialectServices

Line:269, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/dialect/TreeDialectServices.java -> Could you add all /** @inheritDoc */ ?

This could be added in AbstractRepresentationDialectServices

Line:317, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/dialect/DialectServices.java -> I am not sure we really need this method: see org.eclipse.sirius.business.api.dialect.DialectServices.deleteRepresentation(DRepresentation, Session).

We could simply create a DeleteRepresentationTask calling DialectManager..deleteRepresentation(epresentation, session).

Even better: we not not use the DDiagramLink concept, so there is no need to split the actual DeleteDDiagramTask but just rename it to DeleteDRepresentationTask and remove the references to DDiagramLink.

Line:523, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/dialect/DialectManagerImpl.java -> Could you add /** @inheritDoc */ ?

Line:534, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/dialect/DialectManagerImpl.java -> Could you add the /** @inheritDoc */ ?

Line:61, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/helper/task/DeleteDRepresentationTask.java -> We should create another issue to clean this method: I'm not sure we really need all this to cleanly delete a representation GMFUtil could also be deleted. We must check the behavior with the new dangling management.

Line:151, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/helper/task/ModelOperationToTask.java -> Laurent, i think this should be the first case: to allow dialects or diagram types to specialize the tasks for the core model operations.

Line:246, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/helper/task/operations/ExternalJavaActionTask.java -> Laurent, you missed this DeleteDDiagramElementTask.
It has no real java dependency to the diagram dialect excepted in the name. 

It simply reference the a predicate to avoid to delete notation.View.element links. This predicates check the classe and reference names to detect the expected reference.

we should merge the three internal DeleteXXXElementTask into the AbstractDeleteDRepresentationElementTask and rename it DeleteDRepresentationElementTask (it should directly use the notation predicate).

Line:249, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/helper/task/operations/ExternalJavaActionTask.java -> See comments on DialectServices, DeleteRepresentationTask and DeleteDDiagramTask : we should simply create a DeleteRepresentationTask here.

Line:467, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src2/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/business/internal/dialect/DiagramDialectServices.java -> OK but not possible before the split and not possible after the split. It is a feature request.

Line:480, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src2/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/business/internal/dialect/DiagramDialectServices.java -> See previous answer.

Line:69, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/internal/helper/task/DeleteDDiagramTask.java -> Yes but currently (until Bugzilla 427247 will be closed) we must handle them.

Line:378, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.table/src/org/eclipse/sirius/table/business/internal/dialect/TableDialectServices.java -> No because each Dialect should handle its representations. The dialect manager iterates on each dialect until one returns a DeleteDRepresentationTask. If this code is in AbstractRepresentationDialectServices, potentially the specific code for DiagramDialect will be never called.

Line:269, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/dialect/TreeDialectServices.java -> No because each Dialect should handle its representations. The dialect manager iterates on each dialect until one returns a DeleteDRepresentationTask. If this code is in AbstractRepresentationDialectServices, potentially the specific code for DiagramDialect will be never called.

Line:317, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/api/dialect/DialectServices.java -> The code of DiagramDialectServices.deleteRepresentation(DRepresentation, Session) is not really the same as DeleteDDiagramTask. And currently, as said in another comment of this review, we must handle DDiagramLink.
The goal of this global issue is not to clean code (or change the behavior).
So I prefer to create this new method in dialect. I have added a comment in bugzilla 427247 to remove the DeleteDDiagramTask and depreciate this new method when it will be closed).

Line:523, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/dialect/DialectManagerImpl.java -> Done

Line:534, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/dialect/DialectManagerImpl.java -> Done

Line:61, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/helper/task/DeleteDRepresentationTask.java -> OK

Line:151, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/helper/task/ModelOperationToTask.java -> Done

Line:246, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/helper/task/operations/ExternalJavaActionTask.java -> Yes I missed it. But what you said is not really in the scope of this issue because there is no java dependency.
This problem is to deal later.

Line:249, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius/src/org/eclipse/sirius/business/internal/helper/task/operations/ExternalJavaActionTask.java -> See corresponding responses

Line:467, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui/src2/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/ui/business/internal/dialect/DiagramDialectServices.java -> Yes, that's why I wrote "we might" and not "you should".

Line:69, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.diagram/src-core/org/eclipse/sirius/diagram/business/internal/helper/task/DeleteDDiagramTask.java -> I disagree, I have never seen an aird containing such DDIagramLink nor code creating them.

DDiagramLink are never created, I cannot retrieve their creation in versions I know (since 2008)

New details menus (navigation to and creation of other representation) displayed in DRepresentationElement's contextual menus are computed. This concept is an old sequels of a previous metamodel version.

Line:378, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.table/src/org/eclipse/sirius/table/business/internal/dialect/TableDialectServices.java -> AbstractRepresentationDialectServices should then return Options.newNone()

Line:269, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.tree/src/org/eclipse/sirius/tree/business/internal/dialect/TreeDialectServices.java -> AbstractRepresentationDialectServices should then return Options.newNone().
