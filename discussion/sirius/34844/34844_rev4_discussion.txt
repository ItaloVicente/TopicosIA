DESCRIPTION:

[430724] Improve IsModifiedSavingPolicy to avoid false positives

This adaptation of IsModifiedSavingPolicy is closer to the
SavingPolicyImpl strategy:
1. it uses the resource.isModified state as a basis to compute
what needs to be saved.
2. it browse the other resources to detect dependencies toward
resources which are modified
3. it filter this set of logically modified resources by serializing
them in a file buffer and comparing the result with the current file.

This strategy has the following characteristics :
- we avoid many serializations compared to the SavingPolicyImpl
  implementation by using the isModified boolean
- On the other hand we might browse the models, but this is made in a
  way that proxies should not be resolved. In practice this did not even
  came up in the profiling traces.
- we will never ever actually save the file if there is no change (just
  like the previous policy)
- If we *miss* a resource in the first step and don't consider it
logically modified whereas we should, its a bug and some resources might
not have been saved.

Also this commit makes sure only platform:/resources and file:/
resources are considered (which is important for CDOResources for
instance, we don't need to browse the model there, or Ecore resource
with http:// URIs, we don't need to send PUT on the Eclipse Server...)
It make sures non existing files will be saved anyway as their
"isModifed" status would not be enough for a resource which just got
created in memory for instance.
It also makes the IsModifiedSavingPolicy ignore resource.isLoaded
when deciding whether a resource has changes or not. This is necessary
to keep the same behavior as the reference policy.
