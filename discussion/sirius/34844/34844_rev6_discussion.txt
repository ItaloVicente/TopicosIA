DESCRIPTION:

[430724] Improve IsModifiedSavingPolicy to avoid false positives

This adaptation of IsModifiedSavingPolicy is closer to the
SavingPolicyImpl strategy:
1. it uses the resource.isModified state as a basis to compute what
   needs to be saved;
2. it browses the other resources to detect dependencies toward
   resources which are modified;
3. it filters this set of logically modified resources by serializing
   them in a file buffer and comparing the result with the current file.

This strategy has the following characteristics:
- we avoid many serializations compared to the SavingPolicyImpl
  implementation by using the isModified boolean;
- on the other hand we might browse the models, but this is made in a
  way that proxies should not be resolved. In practice this did not even
  came up in the profiling traces;
- we will never ever actually save the file if there is no change (just
  like the previous policy);
- if we *miss* a resource in the first step and don't consider it
  logically modified whereas we should, its a bug and some resources
  might not have been saved.

Also this commit makes sure only platform:/resources and file:/
resources are considered (which is important for CDOResources for
instance, we don't need to browse the model there, or Ecore resource
with http:// URIs, we don't need to send PUT on the Eclipse Server...).
It make sures non existing files will be saved anyway as their
"isModifed" status would not be enough for a resource which just got
created in memory for instance. It also makes the IsModifiedSavingPolicy
ignore resource.isLoaded when deciding whether a resource has changes or
not. This is necessary to keep the same behavior as the reference
policy.
