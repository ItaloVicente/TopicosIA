Line:22, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> Putting the info on the node's style means it will be "inherited" when the mapping is reused or imported in other contexts. I'm not saying it is wrong, but an alternative would have been to make the container decide which of its bordered nodes it wants on which side. It is probably more complex to implement though. But this alternative could be mentioned in the "Implementation choices and tradeoffs".

Line:40, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> While this makes sense technically because of the "clockwise" placement algorithm, it might be confusing to the end users to have their south border filled right to left.

Line:76, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> Also test when the node mapping is reused or imported in other contexts.

Line:10, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> to remove

Line:19, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> presents

Line:19, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> side(s) --> Indeed, I think that this spec should not limit at one side. But a choice between the four sides (1, 2, 3 or 4).

Line:21, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> I think that technical data are too early. If we are not in the context, it's difficult to understand.

Line:24, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> four check boxes (checked by default).

Line:25, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> There is no display change for other nodes.

Line:27, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> @DBorderItemLocator@

Line:29, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> The list must be comprehensive in the spec. 
* resize container (for example)

Line:30, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> why not named it (ExecutionItemLocator, CenteredBorderItemLocator, ...) to be as accurate as possible?

Line:45, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> all checkbox checked

Line:55, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> (except the Metamodel changes)

Line:59, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> borders

Line:76, plugins/org.eclipse.sirius.doc/specs/proposal/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes/440296_Required_side_for_border_nodes.textile -> Also test arrange all, arrange selection, resize of container (and all features listed in the sentence "...should not change the side on which these border nodes are placed even if it is closer.")
