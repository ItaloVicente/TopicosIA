DESCRIPTION:

[560543] Draw operand labels on a new OVERLAY layer so that they are always readable

The overall idea is to add a new "virtual figure" in a new printable
layer OVERLAY_LAYER which is placed on top of the others. When
painted, the figure finds all the operand label figures and asks them
to paint themselves at the proper location (even though they are
technically in a different layer).

The OVERLAY_LAYER is added in DDiagramRootEditPart. The "virtual
figure" is implemented by LabelsOverlayFigure and setup/teared down in
SequenceDiagramEditPart activate/deactivate inside this new layer.

There are several "subtleties" (or hacks, depending on the point of
view) to make this work however:

- LabelsOverlayFigure declares bounds that cover all the diagram to
  avoid clippping issues when drawing the actual labels. However, to
  avoid "capturing" clicks on the diagram it also overrides
  findFigureAt() to let them "pass through".

- If we let the operand labels draw themselves a first time normally
  as part of the operand's paintFigure() and *then* draw them a second
  time later in the overlay, we get slightly bolder labels. This is
  probably due to some very small difference in how
  LabelsOverlayFigure computes the labels position (maybe just some
  rounding error). The current workaround is to customize the
  implementation of operand labels in a new OperandLabel class which
  has a global flag to tell it if it should really draw or not. The
  flag is only set during the LabelsOverlayFigure painting, so the
  labels are only painted once.

- Finally, all of this works fine when displaying the diagram, but not
  when exporting them as images, because the export process only
  considers the diagram's primary edit parts, and so does not see the
  LabelsOverlayFigure (which is not associated to any edit part). To
  work around this, both SiriusDiagramImageGenerator and
  SiriusDiagramSVGGenerator override renderToGraphics() to paint an
  optional overlay figure *after* (and thus on top) the primary edit
  parts, if the diagram provides such an overlay (only SDEP does at
  the moment).
