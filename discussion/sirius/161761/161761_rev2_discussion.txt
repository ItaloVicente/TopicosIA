DESCRIPTION:

[DRAFT 560543] Draw operand labels on the CONNECTION_LAYER so that they
are always readable

The overall idea is to add a new "virtual figure" in the connection
layer which, when painted (above the rest of the diagram), finds all
the operand label figures and asks them to paint themselves at the
proper location (even though they technically in a different layer).

The "virtual figure" in question is implemented by LabelsOverlayFigure
and setup/teared down in SequenceDiagramEditPart activate/deactivate.

There are several "subtleties" (or hacks, depending on the point of
view) to make this work however:

- LabelsOverlayFigure declares bounds that cover all the diagram to
  avoid clippping issues when drawing the actual labels. However, to
  avoid "capturing" clicks on the diagram it also overrides
  findFigureAt() to let them "pass through".

- If we let the operand labels draw themselves a first time normally
  as part of the operand's paintFigure() and *then* draw them a second
  time later in the overlay, we get slightly bolder labels. This is
  probably due to some very small difference in how
  LabelsOverlayFigure computes the labels position (maybe just some
  rounding error). The current workaround is to customize the
  implementation of operand labels in a new OperandLabel class which
  has a global flag to tell it if it should really draw or not. The
  flag is only set during the LabelsOverlayFigure painting, so the
  labels are only painted once.

- Instead of adding a new layer, the LabelsOverlayFigure is put in the
  existing CONNECTION_LAYER. This means the labels are above most of
  the diagram (notably the executions), but *not* the messages, which
  are connections. To force LabelsOverlayFigure to always appear above
  the messages regardless of the order of figures in CONNECTION_LAYER,
  DConnectionLayerEx.paintChildren() has been overriden to paint its
  children in two successive passes: first the "normal" ones
  (edges/messages) and then the children marked with the new
  OverlayFigure interface, which is implemented only by
  LabelsOverlayFigure.

- Finally, all of this works fine when displaying the diagram, but not
  when exporting them as images, because the export process only
  considers the diagram's primary edit parts, and so does not see the
  LabelsOverlayFigure (which is not associated to any edit part). To
  work around this, both SiriusDiagramImageGenerator and
  SiriusDiagramSVGGenerator override renderToGraphics() to paint an
  optional overlay figure *after* (and thus on top) the primary edit
  parts, if the diagram provides such an overlay (only SDEP does at
  the moment).
