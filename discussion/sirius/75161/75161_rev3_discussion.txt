DESCRIPTION:

[493367] Fix unwanted semantic resource loading at session opening

* At session opening, in
SessionResourcesTracker.initialize(IProgressMonitor), the resources that
have been loaded before forceLoadingOfEveryLinkedResource() are ignored
to be potentially added as semantic resource on the session. The problem
is that, because of
DRepresentationDescriptorCreationMigrationParticipant, some semantic
resources are loaded in the aird loading step because of DRepresentation
target proxy resolution. This commit avoids the proxy resolution to fix
the issue.
