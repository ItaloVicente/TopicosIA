DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Pull checkpoint-creation code out from checkpoint-removal

- Allows enhanced testability in future patches on checkpoint-removal
- There is a lot of code duplication in the checkpoint-creation area.
  I'm addressing that too in follow-up patches and this is the very
  first step toward that.
