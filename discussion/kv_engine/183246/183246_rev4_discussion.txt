DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: DCP: Optionally produce SystemEvents with FlatBuffers values

Add a DCP Control option which changes the format of the value that is
sent with each system-event. Instead of the custom mcbp structures the
control enables FlatBuffers structures using the following schema:

  engines/ep/src/collections/events.fbs

With this commit, the KV DCP consumer now attempts to enable FlatBuffers
system events (requiring compatible producer).

The intention of this patch is to provide a cleaner route forward for
updating the metadata of a collection and to later permit modifications
to collection or scope metadata. The FlatBuffers code paths are less
burdensome to maintain compared to the custom mcbp structures added in
7.0.

The majority of the Collection DCP test coverage now uses the
FlatBuffers mode except for a small number of test that use more direct
calls into the DCP consumer, giving coverage of the mcbp defined
structures.

(6 comments)
Line:388, engines/ep/src/connhandler.cc -> I believe addStat assumes null-terminated string, which isn't the case with std::string_view.

Line:890, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> Style: how about adding a "using namespace mcbp::systemevent" in this function to avoid the repetition of the prefix and increase readability?

Line:902, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> Is the fall through for FlushCollection deliberate? If so suggest https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes/fallthrough

Line:937, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.h -> I think we should make `item` be a non-const reference then as the reader might
incorrectly assume it's not modified by this call, even though rc changes.

Line:1011, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.h -> Can we consolidate on std::string_view for the view of the data here? (I'd like to get rid of cb::const_byte_buffer when we get to C++20 and std::span can replace it).

Line:1234, include/memcached/protocol_binary.h -> Might be worth documenting the versions here - or linking back to the markdown docs for full details?
