DESCRIPTION:

MB-25011: Allow buckets to disable/enable xattrs

With full-eviction buckets the set/replace path may see a performance
hit because the read/modify/write semantics required to support xattrs
will see an increase in bg-fetches (where we first see if a key
exists to determine if the new value must inherit existing xattrs).

If a user has pre-spock full-eviction buckets this performance hit
could be an issue for them, if there application is as well pre-spock
then they have 0 xattrs and could get the performance back by
turning xattrs off.

This commit introduces for ep-engine a config switch and cbepctl
option to disable xattrs per bucket.

This works by the engine API gaining a new function "isXattrEnabled"
so that memcached can query the bucket for xattr yes/no.

With isXattrEnabled() returning false the following happens:

* SUBDOC commands with xattr paths will fail validation and see
  PROTOCOL_BINARY_RESPONSE_NOT_SUPPORTED
* SET/REPLACE will short-cut the read/mod/write logic and perform only
  a write (store_if with a alway true predicate).
* Any command with an xattr dataype will be invalid (e.g. set_w_meta)
* DCP will ignore request to open with xattrs, even replication, thus
  if xattrs did exist in the database, they won't be seen on DCP.

Testing:

This patch extends testapp so that it can toggle xattrs using the
set_param command and then adjusts the expected return codes when
xattrs are being used. Some xattr specific tests are adjusted to cope
with when getXattr triggers connection closing (hence they now
reconnect for each mutate/replace)

This also means that default engine now accepts
set_param for xattr_enabled only, this was the simplest way to get
the test harness working for all modes without further churn.
