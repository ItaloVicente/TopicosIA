DESCRIPTION:

MB-47636: Add support for limits and uuid in cbsasl.json

The rate limit properties will be provided through cbsasl.json.
This patch adds support for reading a file with the properties
specified.

The new per-user entry looks like:

    {
      "limits": {
        "egress_mib_per_min": 1,
        "ingress_mib_per_min": 1,
        "num_ops_per_min": 1,
        "num_connections": 1
      },
      "n": "username",
      "sha512": {
        "h": "base64 encoded sha512 hash of the password",
        "s": "base64 encoded salt",
        "i": iteration-count
      },
      "sha256": {
        "h": "base64 encoded sha256 hash of the password",
        "s": "base64 encoded salt",
        "i": iteration-count
      },
      "sha1": {
        "h": "base64 encoded sha1 hash of the password",
        "s": "base64 encoded salt",
        "i": iteration-count
      },
      "plain": "base64 encoded hex version of sha1 hash of plain text password",
      "uuid": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    }

The legal values for the limits are [1, uint64_t::max]. If no value is
set for a limit it is set to 0 (unlimited)
