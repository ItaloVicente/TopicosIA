Simple implementation of a histogram backed by an std::array, for use
with small integral types (most likely uint8_t).

Line:40, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.cc -> This is potentially more costly than a simple atomic increment; and in the real-world workload we expect, would we actually hit more than 2^64-1 count?

(i.e. do we "create" the need for this complexity here due to us taking a `count` argument which I assume is going to always be 1 in the use-cases we have planned right now?)

Line:58, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.cc -> What's the use-case for remove?

Line:85, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.cc -> Uncomment or delete.

Line:31, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.h -> I would suggest that the `MaxValue' param is expressed instead as a `Count` to match the semantics of std::array.

Line:48, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.h -> I don't know how much sense it makes to have default tparams for CountType - and possibly also MaxValue - while it might make some usages a little more terse, in general I feel like the user should be explicit about what they want.

Line:40, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.cc -> Real world, nope I doubt we will hit this - it waas mostly for symmetry (and in principle if using something other than uint64_t counts this could be reached more easily)

Line:58, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.cc -> For the MFU histogram, when an item becomes un-evictable (or is evicted) I intended to remove it's MFU from the histogram.

Line:85, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.cc -> Done

Line:31, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.h -> Done

Line:48, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.h -> Done
