(7 comments)
Line:24, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.cc -> How are negative counts going to be handled, particulary for getValueAtPercentile?

Line:33, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.h -> This can probably use relaxed memory ordering (given typical uses for a histogram) - or in Couchbase-land use the cb::RelaxedAtomic wrapper type.

Line:45, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.h -> Would it be more generic if we templated on scalar value (like std::array<>) then one could use this class for enumeration types which have some finite count less than 256.

Line:100, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.h -> Might not make a difference, but I doubt we need double precision if we are only having ~255 possible discrete values; could we use float instead (and is that any quicker?

Line:105, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.h -> `total` IMO is ambiguous - does that mean the number of samples, or the sum of all values times by their count?

What about `getNumberOfSamples` or similar?

Line:140, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/array_histogram_test.cc -> ... sentence seems to end early...?

Line:149, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/array_histogram_test.cc -> What's the runtime for this under TSan with this number of samples?

Line:24, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.cc -> I didn't intend to handle them at all; prior art either doesn't seem to care (hdrhistogram), doesn't let you decrement (platform histogram), or clamps individual buckets at zero and tracks more information per bucket to do something more sensible when computing percentiles in the presence of overflowed bucket _sums_, where possible (folly).

Silently clamping at zero/max seems like it could turn underflowing/overflow into "drifting", which is still not ideal, but would at least make it so percentiles aren't immediately useless if one bucket underflows.

Throwing seems like the strictest response and would mean we'd catch errors sooner, but might not be great if it ends up tearing down connections etc.

Actually intentionally permitting negative frequencies/counts as part of normal operation doesn't seem to play nicely with percentiles, conceptally. (OTOH negative _values_ could be supported easily if needed, but they aren't currently required).

Gone for clamping for now, but interested in your thoughts.

Line:33, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.h -> Done

Line:45, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.h -> Done - though this does now add the need for bounds checks that weren't necessary before when every representable value of the Value could be guaranteed to be a valid index into the array

Line:100, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.h -> Done

Line:105, engines/ep/src/array_histogram.h -> Done

Line:140, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/array_histogram_test.cc -> Gotta build suspense somehow Dave! Done

Line:149, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/array_histogram_test.cc -> 10s ish, aka too long. Dropping 👍
