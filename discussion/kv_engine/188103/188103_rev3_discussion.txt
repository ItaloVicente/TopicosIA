DESCRIPTION:

MB-55943: Expose the defragmenter task sleep time as a stat

We already have some visibility of what the defragmenter is doing, by
means of the _num_visited stats. Those are not a great proxy for how
frequently the defragmenter runs.

The visitation rate will depend of what the defragmenter is doing. If
we are visiting _and_ moving items, the visitation rate will drop,
because moving items is more expensive than just visiting.

Expose the raw task sleep times as stats.
