DESCRIPTION:

MB-30044: Make TaggedPtr<T> use explicit constructors

Add bool operator==(const TaggedPtr<T>& other) const to TaggedPtr<T>, so
that we can compare two TaggedPtr templates. As currently when comparing
two, they get cased to a bool() and then compared which is incorrect.

Also amend the default value of SingleThreadedRCPtr<T,P,D> to construct
the template Pointer passing it a nullptr apposed to just assigning a
nullptr e.g. use Pointer init = Pointer(nullptr) apposed to Pointer init
= nullptr.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)
Line:131, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> Might be simpler to split this into a zero-arg default ctor and a single arg taking a Pointer. That also avoids a branch in both cases.

Line:246, engines/ep/src/item.h -> Not sure we should be silently "promoting" a Blob* to a TaggedPtr; given the tag will not be set correctly (if someone accidentally passes a Blob* when the owning thing is a TaggedPtr the frequency count would be lost).

Prefer to have just the single existing replaceValue, in the instances where a TaggedPtr must be created I suggest that is done explicitly so we can see if the tag should be also set or not.

Line:503, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> A TaggedPtr isn't related to StoredValue::UniquePtr; this seems strange. 

Given the only think `purged` is used for here is to check some member variables, we should just use use a raw OrderedStoredValue*

Line:566, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Again - this is calling reset() in the context of setting the pointer to point to nothing - the same as variant 1 of https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr/reset

We shouldn't need to pass any argument to it.

Line:1081, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> As previous, this was correct as-is before.

Line:47, engines/ep/src/tagged_ptr.h -> I think if you want to tighten up type-safety, the simplest thing is just to remove this constructor and require callers to always specify the tag they want (ctor at line 51). That I think removes much of the boilerplate you've otherwise added, and still ensures that a TaggedPtr is always explicitly created where necessary.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:503, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> Again, I don't think this should be an owning pointer - certainly not at this line. We probably want to change the erase() at line 506 to be take ownership after it's removed from the seqList.
