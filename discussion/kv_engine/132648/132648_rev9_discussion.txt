DESCRIPTION:

MB-30044: Make TaggedPtr<T> use explicit constructors

Add bool operator==(const TaggedPtr<T>& other) const to TaggedPtr<T>, so
that we can compare two TaggedPtr templates. As currently when comparing
two, they get cased to a bool() and then compared which is incorrect.

Also refactor SingleThreadedRCPtr<T,P,D> to separate the single arg
constructor and default constructor which inits value to Pointer's
default value. Plus add reset() method that resets SingleThreadedRCPtr<>
without taking an argument and sets the value to pointers default value.

(3 comments)
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit cast (casted? I dunno, I've seen both used for past tense)

Line:606, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> I see from previous comments why the tag value is explicitly stated in several places. Would it perhaps be nice to make the "empty" tag value a constant or a struct tag like

 replaceValue({Blob::New(0), foo::NoTag})

or

 replaceValue({Blob::New(0), foo::NoTag{}})

or similar?

Best of both worlds - can't accidentally wrap a Blob* in a new tagged ptr and lose the original tag value, but also avoids magic numbers :)

Line:60, engines/ep/src/tagged_ptr.h -> This is equivalent to

 bool operator==(const TaggedPtr& other) const

though saving 3 chars isn't super important ;)

It might be relevant if we were to add a second template parameter with a default in the future and forgot to update this method, like

 template <typename T, typename U = foo>
 class TaggedPtr;

suddenly, two tagged ptrs of the same instantiation won't always be comparable

 TaggedPtr<int, bar> a;
 TaggedPtr<int, bar> b;
 a == b;

wouldn't compile because operator== is defined with `TaggedPtr<T>` which expands to `TaggedPtr<T, foo>` because foo is the default. In constrast, just `TaggedPtr` will continue to refer to the enclosing instatiation of `TaggedPtr`

Very contrived example, I know! And, given that it won't compile, it's wouldn't lead to bugs in that example, and would easily be fixed. Though, it might be a good habit/code style thing - IIRC something similar _did_ occur with Monotonic (or AtomicMonotonic or something, I forget) and comparisons were not done using operator== but with some implicit conversions (but that won't happen now either thanks to the explicit goodness! 😊)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:60, engines/ep/src/tagged_ptr.h -> Denterly some musings here :D. Think also given we only ever perform a shallow comparison of the pointers it makes sense to be able to compare any templated type :).
