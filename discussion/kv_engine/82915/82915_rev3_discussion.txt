DESCRIPTION:

Add slow commands as phosphor instant traces

We should expand on this to show to entire execution time of the
command. For now, however, this will do.

the change looks a bit premature... wouldn't it be just as easy to instrument conn_execute to add the correct probe initially?

We need to implement a "lazy" Phosphor trace which is only added for slow ops - otherwise we'd end up with extra unnecessary START events in the log.

I asked Ollie to do this as a minimal patch so we have *something* to catch these. We can expand later IMHO.

Hmm.. I'm used to the specualative tracing mechanisms in dtrace and thought we had similar things in phosphor....

Not yet. It's not *super* hard - you'd basically need an RAII-style object which records the start time locally (in the object), and in the destructor gets the end time; and if (end-start > limit) { phosphor_trace(start); phosphor_trace(end).

Given we don't yet have that (and Ollie was wrapping things up), I wanted to get something in.
