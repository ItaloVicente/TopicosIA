DESCRIPTION:

MB-33332: Rename OSV::deletedTime to OSV::completedOrDeletedTime

To purge completed prepares only after the metadata purge interval
we need to know when the prepare was completed (committed or aborted).
We do similar for deleted items, we set a deleted time on deletion
of the OSV and use this time in the HTTombstonePurger to determine if
we should purge the metadata (tombstone) for the delete. We can simply
re-use the field for completed time. Rename the functions to something
more appropriate. They will be used in a later change.
