File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Initial RFC mainly on the input parameter framing (where create has the most 'complexity')

mark down is rendered here https://github.com/jimwwalker/kv_engine/tree/ff3474f210bd30d6283f36ab1035359b0a3130c8/docs/range_scans
Line:241, docs/range_scans/create_range_scan.md -> I'll state that this is a class 1? uuid, iirc there seems to be two types of uuid, one of which has some kind of sub-structure and would actually be transmitted as a variety of u16, u32 each separately swapped in network order. Our UUID we can just state is not that type of uuid, effectively a 16-byte string

Line:23, docs/range_scans/continue_range_scan.md -> Might be worth clarifying if this is the time for the entire scan, of just for this next "chunk" of data to come back from KV-Engine.

Additionally would document what happens if either of those limits are exceeded.

Line:10, docs/range_scans/create_range_scan.md -> Given creating a range scan is _probably_ uncommon (compared to continue etc), and the fact there's a number of variants of format to encode, have you considered just using a JSON object in the value to specify the parameters? 

Makes it much simpler to specify optional things etc - and also allows future changes without changing the framing.

Main downside would be it's more expensive to parse; and possibly larger on the wire (but maybe not if we need fixed 32B header etc to specify various properties...)

Line:44, docs/range_scans/create_range_scan.md -> What's the legal range for this? 2^32 milliseconds is ~46 days, which feels a bit long...

Line:93, docs/range_scans/create_range_scan.md -> Similary here, allowing 4B samples seems a bit large...

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for the feedback, will gather some more comments and update.
Line:23, docs/range_scans/continue_range_scan.md -> Ack

Line:10, docs/range_scans/create_range_scan.md -> Yeah, so far in prototyping JSON input is what I'm planning for quicker development - but it seemed disjoint with the rest of the protocol so wrote up in a binary style to match.

Now collections did add some json inputs, e.g. dcp stream configuration came in a json doc - so maybe it's not so disjoint.

@trond what's your view?

Line:44, docs/range_scans/create_range_scan.md -> We will clamp this down to some sane bound, tbd

Line:93, docs/range_scans/create_range_scan.md -> big data is big! :D yep sensible bounds tbd, the u32 input here just helped alignment of the extra data and u16 seemed possibly too limiting.

Line:10, docs/range_scans/create_range_scan.md -> slcak with Trond and there's more examples than I knew of that use JSON input - so will propose and update (it should be speed development of that part)

Line:10, docs/range_scans/create_range_scan.md -> 👍

(Certainly for bread-and-butter data plane stuff I still think binary encoding is the way to go for max efficiency; but for "control-type" stuff like this - particularly given all the possible permutations something more flexible is probably a good initial choice. We can always do an optimised binary encoding down the line if it actually turns out it matters...)

Line:44, docs/range_scans/create_range_scan.md -> thinking upper limit of a few minutes (maybe just say 10) should be plenty of room and satisfy the unknowns - expectation is real usage would be tens of seconds ?
