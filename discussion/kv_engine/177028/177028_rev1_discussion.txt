DESCRIPTION:

MB-52728: Cookie: Simplify / tighten ewouldblock handling

Simplify the logic around when Cookie::ewouldblock is cleared - this
should only happen from Connection::processNotifiedCookie().

Add additional sanity checks that the status has already been cleared
where it previously was (unnecessarily) cleared.
