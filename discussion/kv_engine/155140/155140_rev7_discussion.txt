DESCRIPTION:

MB-46729: Remove implicit creation of the ExecutorPool

Make sure it is explicitly created before it is used. This is
mostly a "test issue" as the memcached core explicitly create
the pool before starting to accept clients (and shut it down
as part of shutdown)

Change-Id: I36786a844de7dea359bf0cb5ecba77b086e96f52
