DESCRIPTION:

Stripe HashTable statistics per LLC

Each HashTable now has an instance of each HT stat per Last Level
Cache.

Perf investigation while adding a new stat indicated a reasonable
level of contention when updating statistics in
HT::Statistics::epilogue.

Perf with striping per LLC on a machine with two LLCs demonstrated
improved performance in HashTable microbenchmarks.

A stripe per core (e.g., default CoreStore) demonstrates better
performance, but it is currently deemed that the potentially large
memory usage would be unacceptable - at this time, the statistics are
144 bytes per vbucket.

Notably, the HTStatsEpilogue benchmark appears significantly better
with a stripe per core, however that benchmark is not reflective of
normal behaviour.

Line:170, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Damn I meant to add comments before uploading. Now they are corelocal one copy can go negative as long as the total is >=0. I'm not happy about losing that check here though.

Line:170, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Ok - that's fair enough (and one of the downsides of this kind of sharding. a comment would be good :fonzie:
