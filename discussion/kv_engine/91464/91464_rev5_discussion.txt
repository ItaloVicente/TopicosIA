DESCRIPTION:

MB-28749: Unify memcached-XXX-test binaries into memcached_testapp (re-apply)

The memcached testapp tests are split into ~35 different test
binaries. This was primarily done to allow tests to run in parallel
(to speed up CV test time).

Because the testapp tests can run in an embedded mode where they run
an embedded memcached; each test binary essentially contains the whole
of memached. As a result there's two major disadvantages to this
approach :-

1. We need to link ~35 different executables every time any common
   code changes.
2. We need space for ~35 different executables which are 99% the same.

In the case of (2), the binary size of each test can become very large
when building with various diagnostics - for example each binary is
~140MB each when building with UndefinedBehaviourSanitizer. That
totals close to 5GB for all the testapp binaries.

To reduce these sizes, combine the memcached testapp tests into a
single binary.
