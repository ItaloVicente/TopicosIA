DESCRIPTION:

MB-25517: [2/n] Remove dead code related to KVBucket::reset()

KVBucket::reset() is intended to used during CMD_FLUSH and during
bucket initialize to delete all disk files if warmup is not preferred.
But it appears that the code intended for bucket initialize does not
do what it is supposed to do and also we do not support CMD_FLUSH
and hence the code is redundant.

This commit gets rid of the redundant code.
