DESCRIPTION:

MB-25517: [2/n] Remove dead code related to KVBucket::reset()

KVBucket::reset() is intended to used during CMD_FLUSH and during
bucket initialize to delete all disk files if warmup is not preferred.
But it appears that the code intended for bucket initialize does not
do what it is supposed to do and also we do not support CMD_FLUSH
and hence the code is redundant.

This commit gets rid of the redundant code.

Line:215, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> When EPBucket::reset() notifies the flusher, diskDeleteAll is not set to true. Hence flushVBucket does not really flush all the data in the disk.

Hence I think, EPBucket::reset() is never called (in initialize)

Line:353, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> I don't think this is ever called as this does not seem to delete all data on the disk

Line:215, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> If you're not 100% sure, we could add an assert (actually throw an exception) here for now, at least then we'll know if our assumption is incorrect (instead of potentially doing the wrong thing here).

Line:353, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> It might be called by Ephemeral, as that has warmup disabled. However it probably shouldn't matter.

Line:215, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> I am 100% sure that 'diskDeleteAll' is always false now (since we don't do CMD_FLUSH anymore) and hence the piece of code inside the 'if condition' is never executes

Line:353, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Yup,
1) it shouldn't matter in Ephemeral as there is nothing to reset during init.
2) In EPBucket I understand from seeing previous code that reset was never actually deleting the disk files and hence I think we never expected 'config.isWarmup() == false' in EPBucket
