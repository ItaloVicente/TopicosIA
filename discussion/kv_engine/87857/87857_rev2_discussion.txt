DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Clear ewb flag in thread notification

As a preparation for supporting multiple commands per
connection we should clear the ewb flag whenever we
notify a connection.

Move the logic for executing the command into Cookie::execute
to allow it to be called for multiple cookies for the same
connection.
