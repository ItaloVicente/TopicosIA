DESCRIPTION:

MB-25632: Allow slow op threshold to be customised

This patch removes the hardcoded threshold limits for various
commands, and place all of them in a JSON file with the following
syntax:

{
  "version": 1,
  "comment": "User supplied comment for the file (optional)"
  "default": {
    "slow": 500
  },
  "command-name": {
    "slow": 100
  },
}

The version field is mandatory and dictates the format of the fields
the parser should expect (to allow us to modify the content and still
be able to read the files in an upgrade scenario).

The comment is optional and ignored by the parser.

The field "default" is optional and contains the entry when there
isn't specified a value.

The rest of the file should contain entries per command. Each of
these entries contains a single filed "slow" which contains the
threshold for that command (we might want to add other fields
later on).

If the value for slow is specified as a number, it is specified
in milliseconds. If the value is specified as a string it may
also contain one of the following specifiers:

    ns / nanoseconds
    us / microseconds
    ms / milliseconds
    s / seconds
    m / minutes
    h / hours

ex:

 "compact_db": {
    "slow": "30 m"
 }

Line:125, daemon/ioctl.cc -> Given this is an end-to-end SLA (includes whatever time the underlying engine etc takes), it doesn't feel like it's specific to mcbp. For example; if we still had greenstack (or another protocol in future), this would still be applicable.

Maybe drop or change the "mcbp" prefix?

File Comment: etc/couchbase/kv/opcode-attributes.d/override-2.json -> This looks like a test / example file - do we actually want this installed by default?
File Comment: etc/couchbase/kv/opcode-attributes.json -> Probably worth adding a comment to this specifying it's the default file?
Line:4, etc/couchbase/kv/opcode-attributes.json -> For ease of use for humans, I think it's worth making the unit mandatory. To the reader it's not clear if this is nano, micro or milliseconds...

Line:87, protocol/mcbp/libmcbp/sla.cc -> If you use acquire/release (http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order) then I everything should be correct.

Line:125, daemon/ioctl.cc -> Done

File Comment: etc/couchbase/kv/opcode-attributes.d/override-2.json -> It is not installed by default.. there is no install target for this file
File Comment: etc/couchbase/kv/opcode-attributes.json -> Done
Line:4, etc/couchbase/kv/opcode-attributes.json -> Done

Line:87, protocol/mcbp/libmcbp/sla.cc -> No.. because what I do is:

1) initialise everything to the default value
2) set whatever timeout the user specified for that given command.

If someone calls this code between 1 and 2 they'll get the "wrong" entry. But that isn't really very problematic as all they'll see is potential som "incorrect" values being reported.
