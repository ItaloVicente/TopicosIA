DESCRIPTION:

MB-51681: Replace full CM scans with variables updated in-place

Instead of looping through every checkpoint owned
by the CheckpointManager and summing the individual
stats, create CM-level variables which are updated
in-place by Checkpoint MemoryCounters.

Change-Id: I369046cc1d966204e92a35c45799acd01d1d7b70
