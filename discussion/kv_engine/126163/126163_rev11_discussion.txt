DESCRIPTION:

MB-37319: Add configuration for Point in Time Recovery (PiTR)

This commit adds 3 new configuration parameters:

   pitr_enabled
   pitr_max_history_age
   pitr_granularity

pitr_enabled is the master switch to enable / disable PiTR. When
disabled compaction will clear all old revisions within the database.
When enabled the two new configuration parameters is used:

pitr_max_history_age controls how far back in time we want to be able
to jump back to. By default this is set to 24 hours. During compaction
all database revisions up to this point will be nuked.

pitr_granularity controls the number of intermediate revisions of
the database we keep from pitr_max_history_age up to the current
time. It is used as a delta from pitr_max_history_age and all
database revisions which falls into one delta will be squashed
into 1 revision.

Line:771, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I think having different units for history_age and granularity might be problematic - particularly for testing if we want to quickly test small datasets.

Perhaps just use seconds for both?

Line:783, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Could you expand this a little; what granularity means here.

Line:771, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I guess we could use that (I see the value for testing)..

The reason I went with hours here is because of how you calculate the oldest time and the different "stages" as part of compaction. I don't really think 1 sec granularity is very useful for people (great selling point and for demos, but....):

  1. It'll significantly grow the database (its 337,5M _per vbucket just for the header blocks). 
  2. When things go wrong and people want to roll back in time... how do they know that they need to roll back to 02:14:31AM and not 02:14:32AM. and would it be so "bad" to have to roll back to 02:14:00. (and do people want to stay offline so long to figure out the exact second they want to roll back to). 

With hours I always counted from the "beginning" of the current hour, causing lets say 10 minute granularity would always be on the same "offset" from the starting point.. when using second (oldest 86400 from "now" and then every 600 second from that point would cause the "bars" to differ for each run. anyway that can be fixed :)

Line:783, engines/ep/configuration.json -> will do

Line:771, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I'm not suggesting we'd actually use a value less than 1 hour in production (maybe we'd never expose a knob with anything less than 1 hour) - so I don't think there's any issue about database size (unless the small value was used).

Having said that, I _do_ think "hours" might be too course in some production systems - for very high write loads keeping an hours worth of data if we allow 1 second granularity (3600 B-trees) might be too long - so at the very least I think we should have minutes for this.
