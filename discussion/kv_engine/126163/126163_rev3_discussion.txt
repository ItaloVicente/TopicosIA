DESCRIPTION:

Add configuration for Point in Time Recovery (PiTR)

This commit adds 3 new configuration parameters:

   pitr_enabled
   pitr_max_history_age
   pitr_granularity

pitr_enabled is the master switch to enable / disable PiTR. When
disabled compaction will clear all old revisions within the database.
When enabled the two new configuration parameters is used:

pitr_max_history_age controls how far back in time we want to be able
to jump back to. By default this is set to 24 hours. During compaction
all database revisions up to this point will be nuked.

pitr_granularity controls the number of intermediate revisions of
the database we keep from pitr_max_history_age up to the current
time. It is used as a delta from pitr_max_history age and all
database revisions which falls into one delta will be squashed
into 1 revision.
