DESCRIPTION:

Merge branch 'neo'

* neo:
  MB-51606: Don't throw if PDM of dead vBucket tries to ack
  MB-51606: Update seqno ack to send outside state lock
  MB-51606: Pass VB State lock to VBucket::sendSeqnoAck()
  MB-51606: Pass VB State lock to PDM::notifySnapshotEndReceived()
  MB-51606: Pass VB State lock to DM::notifyLocalPersistence()
  MB-51606: Notify DM for persistence of dead vBuckets
  MB-51606: Split setupConsumerAndPassiveStream fn into components

This merge was merged with strategy -s ours as all of these patches
have since been reverted in the neo branch pending a bug fix and I
didn't want to block catching up the neo to master merges on that
fix.
