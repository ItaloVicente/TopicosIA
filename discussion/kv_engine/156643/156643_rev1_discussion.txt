DESCRIPTION:

MB-29928: Switch fragmentation scoring/weighting to use high-water mark

The justification for this change is based on current KV behaviour
and some input from a few 'random' real life log snapshots.

1) Current behaviour of KV's item-pager is to try and keep memory
below the high-water mark, at times of memory pressure it will attempt
to move memory to the low-water mark. The defragmenter cannot affect
mem_used, but it can affect the bucket's resident memory. Here we
allow the defragmenter's sleep to become most aggressive when
the resident memory is close/above the high-water mark.

2) It's not uncommon for users to have their mem_used between
the low and high water marks. This change means that the defragmenter
won't just be at it's most 'aggressive' for the users that are happily
between the two, only when they approach the high-water mark will
the scoring/weighting become higher.

Line:230, engines/ep/src/defragmenter.cc -> Looking at this again, why is are the watermarks relevant to fragmentation? Shouldn't this just be the ratio of RSS to mem_used ?

Line:230, engines/ep/src/defragmenter.cc -> I observed that fragmentation alone is not ideal, I had an empty bucket with greater than 20% and both auto modes just started running the defragger aggresively, yet they have no impact on fragmentation.

So I looked at the water-mark 'weighting' for a couple of reasons

1) It's indicative of there being something to defragment, raw resident item count could also be something here, but point 2 was considered as well.
2) When the bucket has plenty of free-space, the defragmenter just doesn't really need to be so aggressive, e.g. if we're 20% fragmented but using only 10% of quota, it doesn't seem like we have a need for the ramping up of fragmentation rate. However if mem_used (and RSS) approach the water mark (currently low), then 'reclamation' via aggressive defragmentation is more worthy use of our time.

Switching from low to high here seems more in-keeping with how we use those water marks for mem_used managment (and how some users also make use of their quota).

Line:230, engines/ep/src/defragmenter.cc -> Thanks for the detailed explanation - I was reading over the code and just wondered why mem_used / RSS was insufficient - makes sense.

Might be worth adding your above comment into the code - I think that would help any futures readers of this function.
