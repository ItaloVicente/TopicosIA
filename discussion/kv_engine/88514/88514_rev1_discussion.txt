Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think this comments need to explain why, because that's what I've been trying to figure out  (it doesn't match the description in the doc).

The argument I can think of right now is that passive is the new "default" mode for buckets, but people might not have upgraded their clients to use this feature and hence most traffic will still be uncompressed which will cause us to have to inflate every document we just warmed up every time we serve it until they're paged out?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> In 'passive' mode, documents are stored as provided by the client. On a restart (thus resulting in a warmup), we don't maintain any state of whether this was initially sent in as 'compressed' or not. If we went ahead and retrieved as compressed, an uncompressed document, that could be KV-engine actively compressing the document which seems more of an 'active' mode characteristic. Hence, in 'passive' mode, store it as uncompressed.
