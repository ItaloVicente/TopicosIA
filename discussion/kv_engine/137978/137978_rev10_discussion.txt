DESCRIPTION:

MB-39505: Add privilege checking to StatCollector interface

CBStats must limit which scopes/collections stats are returned for
based upon the privileges of the authed user. This was checked through
use of the cookie.

Prometheus stats require the authed user to have the Stats privilege,
allowing the collection of _all_ system stats, including all scopes and
collections. Prometheus collectors do _not_ have a cookie to test
privileges on.

Code using StatCollector can no longer rely upon a cookie being
available, so add support for privilege checking through the
StatCollector interface, to allow differing implementations.

Line:118, include/statistics/cbstat_collector.h -> self nit, not sure it's worth another CV pass but noting in case there are other things to change too

Line:100, statistics/cbstat_collector.cc -> I didn't manage to follow through where testPrivilegeForStat() is called from, but do we want to leak (back to to the user) the presence / absence of collections based on what privs they have? i.e. could a malicious actor use the difference between no_access and unknown_{collection,scope} to infer existence?

Line:100, statistics/cbstat_collector.cc -> It's useage comes in in a later patch (thinking about it it should probably be squashed into one, so this code isn't merged without being defended by the existing scope/col priv tests).
Originally this just returned a bool, but doOne{Scope,Collection}Stats returned the status from testPrivilege all the way back to the caller (and the patch using this interface instead failed to store a correct status _at all_).

Returning the status _here_ was to avoid changing that behaviour.

I _believe_ the Fail/FailNoPrivileges distinction is intentional:

>            // They don't have that scope at all, but do they have any
            // collection privileges which will determine  the error code.
            status = collectionPrivilegeExists
                             ? PrivilegeAccessFail
                             : PrivilegeAccessFailNoPrivileges;


I am under the impression that Fail means "user is aware of this scope/collection because they have other privileges, but they lack the specific one they need for this op" vs "user has no privileges for this collection, keep it hidden from them". That's all decided by the privilege database checking side of things, and this just plumbs through the matching exception.

Line:100, statistics/cbstat_collector.cc -> Ok, thanks. I think it is worth squashing those two patches to ensure test coverage etc.
