DESCRIPTION:

MB-33389 [SR]: Wrap VBucket::durabilityMonitor in SynchronizedPtr<>

The durabilityMonitor member of VBucket (a unique_ptr) can be changed
when a vBucket changes state from active <-> replica. Additionally,
forthcoming patches to persist the replicationTopology (owned by
DurabilityMonitor) require additonal calls through the
durabilityMonitor unique_ptr.

We therefore need to synchronise access to the DurabilityMonitor.

Do this using folly's SynchronizedPtr<> wrapper - from the folly
documentation:

    `SynchronizedPtr` is a variation on the `Synchronized` idea that's
    useful for some cases where you want to protect a pointed-to
    object (or an object within some pointer-like wrapper). If you
    would otherwise need to use
    `Synchronized<smart_ptr<Synchronized<T>>>` consider using
    `SynchronizedPtr<smart_ptr<T>>`as it is a bit easier to use and it
    works when you want the `T` object at runtime to actually a
    subclass of `T`.
