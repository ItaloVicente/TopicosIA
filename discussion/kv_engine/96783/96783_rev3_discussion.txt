DESCRIPTION:

Fix readyQ data race in StreamTest.BackfillOnly

The backfill task pushes items to the Stream::readyQ. So, it is
necessary to acquire a lock to the streamMutex when accessing
the readyQ while the backfill task is still executing.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can you tag this with the same MB as you made the previous change?

Line:1300, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Technically we probably should also acquire the lock here.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> No MB for the previous change (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/96617/), is it ok to link the change itself?
