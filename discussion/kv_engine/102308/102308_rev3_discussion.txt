DESCRIPTION:

Defend against futureQueue being broken

As seen during investigation of MB-32181 it is possible for the
ordering invariant of FutureQueue to be broken if a tasks' waketime is
modified without re-heapifying the FutureQueue.

To try to defend against any future issues this patch:

1. Moves the GlobalTask::wakeUp method to protected - care is needed
   when using this; it's only safe if the task is going to be
   re-scheduled (to re-sort the heap).

2. Adds a assertion to check the invariants of the futureQueue - that
   all items are in order. Given this is potentially expensive O(N)
   tasks, and that failure throws an exception it is only enabled if
   CB_DEVELOPMENT_ASSERTS compile-time flag is enabled.
