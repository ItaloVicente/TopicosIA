DESCRIPTION:

MB-55269 Add db_history_file_size stat

db_history_file_size is the on disk size of the history that is retained
by a kvstore. It is reported in the diskinfo stat group.

Also clarify in the docs that db_data_size won't include unfragmented
data that is part of the history.

ns_server will use it to compute couch_docs_fragmentation as:
((db_file_size-db_history_file_size)-db_data_size)/
(db_file_size-db_history_file_size)

Change-Id: I48736ebf6a2a12367f363061fb63ce8af4823943
