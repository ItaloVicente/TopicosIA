DESCRIPTION:

MB-55672: Convert RangeScan to perform network IO on frontend

Before this commit the "send" of the data read by a RangeScan was
occurring on the IO task. With this commit now all data read by
a RangeScan is "sent" by the frontend executor.

RangeScan's are converted to follow the established notify IO complete
pattern.

* Front-end executor receives a client's range-scan-continue request
* ep-engine schedules an IO task
* IO task scans until something triggers the task to yield and passes
  a engine_errc status via notifyIOComplete
* Front-end executor now "sends" all data that was placed into a buffer
  by the IO task.
* range-scan-continue is now.
  * Done: The continue reached a client requested limit.
  * Done: The continue reached the end of the range.
  * Done: The scan was cancelled, by error or by request.
  * Continued: None of the above occurred and the scan is scheduled
    for more scanning.

With this change some of the RangeScan state management is simplified
in that the RangeScanOwner does all of the state changes in response
to the status of a continue - no longer does the IO task drive the
state to be Cancelled/Complete.

With this change the performance of a RangeScan (as measured by the
rangescan tool) is reduced. Even though the internal scan buffer is
still 8k in size, prior to this change between the send of each 8k
there was no delay waiting for the IO task to be rescheduled. Now
each time the buffer is full and requires sending there is a the cost
of scheduling and waiting for the task to run again.

Some numbers from the rangescan tool suggest that with this commit
there is a ~7% reduction in rangescan throughput.

Single node, 16 vbucket 420MB of data returned by the scan.

Time to perform key scan (no limits), average of 5 runs.

------|------
37.8s | 40.6s

This difference can be removed by increasing the RangeScan buffer size
and will be done in a later commit.
