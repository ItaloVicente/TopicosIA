DESCRIPTION:

MB-43238: [BP] Don't expire committed items if prepare exists

We shouldn't expire committed items when prepares exist as this
will cause DCP to be torn down when the replica returns an error
when it tries to process the expiry (as a SyncWrite is in flight).

This is only an issue with expirations due to access.
