DESCRIPTION:

MB-49040: Modify a scope when the Manifest is different

As vbuckets switch to active they always perform a
VB::Manifest vs Manifest 'compare'.

Q: Do the vbucket have all (and equal) scopes/collections from the
   Manifest?

This check is now updated.

Q: Do the scopes have the same data-limit value as the Manifest?

This check is needed because data-limits are not replicated in scope
creation events - so a replica VB::Manifest will not directly be given
the current limit when it is created via 'replicaCreateScope' - so
at the promotion to active the correct limit will be applied.

However because the scope DataLimit is actually stored in the
ScopeSharedMetaData, only when a bucket has replica only vbuckets
will this code be required (this occurs when we add a node to a
cluster). Secondly the very first vbucket which switches to active
will update the ScopeSharedMetaData and all vbuckets after that now
have the correct limit.

This change also requires that the data-limit in the
ScopeSharedMetaData be synchronised as it could be read by any thread
whilst another is doing an update.
