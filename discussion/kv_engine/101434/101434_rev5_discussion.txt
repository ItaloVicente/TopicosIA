DESCRIPTION:

Change mis-leading name of notifyAllPausedConnections function

The notifyAllPausedConnections actually only notifies those connections
in the pendingNotifications queue.

As we have already have a function named notifyPausedConnection (which
adds to the pendingNotifications queue) I wanted to avoid using the name
notifyConnections.  Therefore I am using processPendingNotifications as
the function name.

Line:90, engines/ep/src/connmap.h -> The name is quite self-explaining, maybe worth adding a comment saying e.g. where we are adding the connection and what is going to process them?

Line:1515, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> It seems wrong (if we want to keep the previous behaviour), shouldn't it be scheduleNotifyIfNecessary() ?

Line:244, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> We need amend this comment

Line:246, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> Good to add a comment

Line:393, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> I write the following as note, we don't have to change anything in this patch.

I've noticed that we have 2 different behaviour in the way we notify:
1) when we process buffered items (I know that we are going to remove that) in the DcpConsumerTask, we notify the connection (ie, no schedule)
2) here (frontend thread) we schedule

Note sure about a couple of things:
- maybe we do this before calling notifyIOComplete from a frontend thread could lead to deadlock by lock inversion with the thread.mutex and another lock (if we have it on the same code path, I have to check)
- I don't expect any relevant perf degradation here if the other parts of the system are working fine, but we would delay the notification if the ConnNotifier is slow

Line:1286, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> We have exactly the same in DcpConsumer, is it doable to move both into the base class ConnHandle ?

Line:188, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> Maybe add small comment

Line:90, engines/ep/src/connmap.h -> Done

Line:1515, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> agreed - is fixed in later patch.

Line:244, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> Done

Line:246, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> Done

Line:393, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> I think its probably fine to make everything a scheduleNotify - but agree need to check.

Line:1286, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Tried this but can't because of shared_from_this.  It becomes a very big change, so something to look at in a separate patch.

Line:188, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> Done
