DESCRIPTION:

Change mis-leading name of notifyAllPausedConnections function

The notifyAllPausedConnections actually only notifies those connections
in the pendingNotifications queue.

As we have already have a function named notifyPausedConnection (which
adds to the pendingNotifications queue) I wanted to avoid using the name
notifyConnections.  Therefore I am using processPendingNotifications as
the function name.
