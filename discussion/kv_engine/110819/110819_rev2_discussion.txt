DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Use persisted vbucket_state when flushing

Currently we base any vbucket_state changes on the in-memory
vbucket_state when flushing. This is not just error prone, but it's
also problematic when we want to persist the HighPreparedSeqno (HPS).
Currently this will reset the HighCompletedSeqno (HCS) to 0 as we leave
it defaulted (0) when return the in-memory vbucket_state. This then
causes the update of the on disk vbucket_state to overwrite the
HighCompletedSeqno.

We should instead base any changes to the vbucket_state on the on disk
vbucket_state so that we do not overwrite unchanged values
unintentionally.
