DESCRIPTION:

Fix NotifiableTask default sleep time

Snoozing a task for INT_MAX seconds is treated as "sleep forever"
by GlobalTask.

NotifiableTask provides an overridable `getSleepTime()`, which
defaulted to

 std::numeric_limits<size_t>::max()

This value is larger than INT_MAX, but is not treated as "sleep
forever".

Instead, it is used as a duration relative to now(). This is likely to
overflow, and would not lead to the expected behaviour.

Fortunately, this is benign as no existing task relied on this sleep
time - the only subclass overrode this default.

Fix by updating the default sleep time.

RFC: should global task check for >= INT_MAX?

Or maybe it would be good to pull the magic "sleep forever" value out into a constant.

Line:46, executor/notifiable_task.h -> I'm tempted to have this return the macro `INT_MAX` for ease of grepping (we should really change it all to an integer chrono amount at some point...)

Line:46, executor/notifiable_task.h -> Will change.

On greppability though, how'd you feel about a constant like

 constexpr int GlobalTask::forever = INT_MAX;

e.g.,

 snooze(forever);

Line:46, executor/notifiable_task.h -> I'd rather just fix it "properly" - I'm nervous of messing around with the current definition of INT_MAX == forever as we actually do a double-to-int equality which apparently works but feels very brittle.

We should just change all snooze() calls to take a clock::duration type instead really.

Line:46, executor/notifiable_task.h -> Roger - will INT_MAX for now, and raise an MB for a proper fix down the line.
