DESCRIPTION:

Add WITH_TRACE macro to ease debugging

Problem:
Consider DurabilityMonitorTest::assertNumTrackedAndHPSAndHCS
This method contains ASSERT_*s and is used widely in DurabliltyMonitor
tests.
When an assert in this method fails, the error provided reports the
line inside the method (quite logically), not the call site.

Solution:
Google Test provides a SCOPED_TRACE which adds a message and line
number to any failed asserts (etc.) while it is in scope. For
convenience, add a macro WITH_TRACE which creates a SCOPED_TRACE in a
scope wrapping the argument. Not ground breaking, but makes debugging
tests with lots of repeated calls to the same asserting method easier.

As mentioned, not an important change, but if it is going to be useful multiple times might as well get it reviewed :shrug:
We may already have an existing convention for this

Line:32, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.h -> IMHO I'm not sure this really adds much, given the extra level of indirection / customisation we are adding to GTest:

- It's an extra Couchbase-specific thing which isn't documented in the normal GoogleTest docs.
- It's not (currently) documented here!
- It doesn't add much abstraction - the user is saving pretty minimal text and as currently written has lost the ability to add their own label to the scope. In the example you print you could have just written:

 {
     SCOPED_TRACE("label");
     assertNumTrackedAndHPSAndHCS(0, 0, 0 /*expectedHCS*/));
 }

Agree with Dave - not worth while
