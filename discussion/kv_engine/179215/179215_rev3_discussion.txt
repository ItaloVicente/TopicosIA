DESCRIPTION:

MB-52054: Make CheckpointCursor::getRemainingItemsCount() O(1) from (n)

This patch is intended to reduce the cost of calling
CheckpointCursor::getRemainingItemsCount(). As it currently has to walk
though the Checkpoint's items to calculate the number of items left.
This is problematic this method is called frequently as part of stat
calls. So we want to reduce any unnecessary work.

To do this we've modified the Checkpoint class to record the number of
non-meta items inside the checkpoint and CheckpointCursor to record the
number of non-meta items that it's seen that are still within the
checkpoint i.e. we will dec the non-meta seen number for any items that
have been expelled from the checkpoint.

This patch also updates relevant unit tests to only check for the number
of non-meta items.

Line:1951, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> This is incorrect, as expelledItems in general is meta+nonMeta items expelled from the checkpoint.

The only way for keeping an exact count of non-meta items at expel is to scan the expelledItems container, which is a O(N) operation. Even if we execute that operation without holding the CM::queueLock, that potentially slows down the expel operation, which is better to avoid as that might increase our mem-recovery times and thus extend TempOOM time-windows where frontend ops are rejected.

I recall that we discussed that I'm already on solving the same problem (as part of MB-52276).
Actually I had already made this part O(1) by avoiding any need of distinguishing between meta/nonMeta items in the Checkpoint item count. I had to revert the change at https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/176541, see the various MBs for the motivation.

Line:1951, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Partial correction on my comment.
We already do a O(N) (without holding the CM::queueLock) scan of expelled items at caller, see CheckpointManager::expelUnreferencedCheckpointItems for details.

In theory we could compute the number of meta/nonMeta items within that exiting loop.

But the general idea of MB-52276 still applies. We don't need to re-introduce the extra complexity of maintaining a numNonMetaItems counter for making CheckpointCursor::getRemainingItemsCount() O(1).
