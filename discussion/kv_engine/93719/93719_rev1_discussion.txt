Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I don't like the part where calling the macros no longer contains the semicolon. A workaround for that is to use the common:

    do { \
        if (ok) { \
            .... bla bla ... \
        } \
    } while (false)

That being said, wouldn't it be better to deal with this where we use a nullptr for the cookie? These trace macros is intended to be used for client driven operations, and I don't think it makes sense to call them from a context without a client context? (the cookie's should be treated as a gsl::not_null<const void*> everywhere)

I noted that the backtrace from the crash (https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-29501) occurred when warmup was issuing a background fetch - where there isn't a cookie.

In addition to Trond's suggestions, we can address this issue by making the TRACE_BEGIN() call in VBucketBGFetchItem's constructor be optional based on if cookie is null, instead of pushing the if() check down into the macro.
