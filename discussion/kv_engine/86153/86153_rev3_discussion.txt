DESCRIPTION:

MB-27036: Extend the scope of conn shared_ptr while logging in stream

When a stream object uses a the connection logger object for logging
it should ensure that the connection object is alive. For this,
the Stream::getLogger() should also return the shared_ptr for the
connection object (along with the logger obj), so that the connection
object is not deleted while logging.
