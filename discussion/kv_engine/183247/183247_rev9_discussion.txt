DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: Update SystemEvent to include history configuration

Update the schema in events.fbs to include a new bool field for storing
the collections history setting.

DCP will now include the value a collection was created with and
provided the consumer/producer have negotiated FlatBuffers events the
replica is updated to read this value when processing a
CreateCollection.

Line:17, engines/ep/src/collections/events.fbs -> Perhaps add a caveat that they were not stored in flat buffers format until 7.2 ?

Line:17, engines/ep/src/collections/events.fbs -> This data and these fields has always stored using flatbuffers format since 7.0. 

The addition of history is 7.2

The new ability to see system events in this format over DCP is also 7.2 - but that is mentioned in the control.md document 

Does that cover it or is there any better commentary to add?

Line:17, engines/ep/src/collections/events.fbs -> Ah sorry, I was thinking of the DCP format, I'd forgotten they were already flatbuffers on disk :disappear:
