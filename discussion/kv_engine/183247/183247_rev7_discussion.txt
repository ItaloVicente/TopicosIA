DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: Update SystemEvent to include history configuration

Update the schema in events.fbs to include a new bool field for storing
the collections history setting.

DCP will now include the value a collection was created with and
provided the consumer/producer have negotiated FlatBuffers events the
replica is updated to read this value when processing a
CreateCollection.
