DESCRIPTION:

MB-30041: Convert Filter to nlohmann::json

Replace cJson processing with nlohmann::json

As part of the conversion, clean-up the construction

1) No need to create std::string for the input, json::parse
uses iterators so can accept a const buffer

2) Swap use of byte_buffer for char_buffer

Note dcp_open API is to be updated and that commit will
fully change use of byte_buffer to char_buffer, this commit
only changes the Filter constructor.
