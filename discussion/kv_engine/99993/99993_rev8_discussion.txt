DESCRIPTION:

MB-31391: Ensure manifest uid is incrementing

Add a check into the set_manifest path to ensure that we
cannot decrement the manifest uid. Also, ensure that a manifest
is the same if the manifest uid does not change.

Leaving this as WeaklyMonotonic for now. It is possible to change the bucket level manifest uid to a strictly Monotonic value, however, we use manifest uids in VBucket manifests and these are not strictly monotonic in the case where we send multiple collection additions or deletions and only update the manifest uid when we send the last one. I could separate the types, but I think this may lead back to the confusion Jim had where we have multiple manifest uid types

File Comment: engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/test_manifest.h -> Actually don't think I need this in this patch anymore, I removed the scope based tests. There's another patch somewhere that introduces this where necessary
