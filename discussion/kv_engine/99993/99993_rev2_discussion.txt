DESCRIPTION:

MB-31391: Ensure manifest uid is incrementing

Add a check into the set_manifest path to ensure that we
cannot decrement the manifest uid. Also, ensure that a manifest
is the same if the manifest uid does not change.

Line:70, engines/ep/src/collections/manager.cc -> This is potentially a bit slow. O(n^2) + O(m^2) where n is size of scopes and m is size of collections because we are using unordered_map. For a small number we are fine, but could be an issue for many collections and/or scopes. 

Also, what if we get a manifest with a load of scopes that have no associated collections? We don't have a scope limit in the same way that we have a collection limit so we may want to put something in to prevent the user from shooting themselves in the foot

Line:67, engines/ep/src/collections/manager.cc -> Do we need this check? Or could we force manifestUid to be strictly increasing?

Line:70, engines/ep/src/collections/manager.cc -> as discussed, comparing is less interesting, we'll trust ns_server on this, just log if the uid is not > current and error as you are!
