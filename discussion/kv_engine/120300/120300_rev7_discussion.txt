DESCRIPTION:

MB-37280: Move OutstandingItems struct from ActiveStream to its own file

We want to merge OutstandingItemsResults (used in ActiveStream) and
ItemsForCursor (returned from CheckpointManager) as they are logically
the same thing.
As first step, move the old OutstandingItemsResults into its own file
and rename it to OutstandingItems.
