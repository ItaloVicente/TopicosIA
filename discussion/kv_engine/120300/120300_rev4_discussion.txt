DESCRIPTION:

MB-37280: Move OutstandingItems struct from ActiveStream to ep_types.h

We want to merge OutstandingItemsResults (used in ActiveStream) and
ItemsForCursor (returned from CheckpointManager) as they are logically
the same thing.
As first step, move the old OutstandingItemsResults into ep_types.h and
rename it to OutstandingItems.
