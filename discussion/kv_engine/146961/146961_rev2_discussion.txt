DESCRIPTION:

MB-41257: Abort warmup if we fail to make KVFileHandle to vbucket file

During Warmup::loadCollectionStatsForShard() we try and collect
collection's stats from disk. As a prerequisite of calling
KVStore::getCollectionStats() we need to pass it a ref to a KVFileHandle
that will allow us to access KVStore for the current vbucket. If
KVStore::makeFileHandle() returns a nullptr this was cause us to de-ref
an invalid pointer.

To prevent this check the output of KVStore::makeFileHandle(), if its
nullptr then abort warmup as we're unable to access the data file on
disk. Which will cause problems further down the line in warmup.
