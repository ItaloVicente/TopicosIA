DESCRIPTION:

MB-28492: Allow running verbose mode from testapp tests

Due to the layered architecture of spdlogger where we build
up a chain of sinks where we send the log message, each of
these sinks may filter only a subset of the messages.

When running in production we don't want the console logger
to log below the warning level, as ns_server is the consumer
and it can't keep up with the amount of data we would otherwise
log. ns_server's solution to that is to "drop" the log, so
we'd rather just log at a rate it can consume.

Running in unit-test-mode we do however want to be able to
send more output to the console so we need to set the filter
level to trace (note that the filter set by the logger
on top would cause the events to be filtered out unless
verbosity is bumped)

Line:162, logger/spdlogger.cc -> Isn't this too verbose now for the normal "production" case?

I think we should probably simplify this / return to the configuration we used to have - the logger client (memcached.exe for testapp tests; ep_unit_tests_main.cc, etc) should simply issue a call to set the level to whatever level it desires.

Line:162, logger/spdlogger.cc -> No, look at line 201 that's where we set the level for the entire logger.. so unless you bump the level there we'd drop the log there...
