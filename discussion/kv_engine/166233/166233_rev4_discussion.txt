DESCRIPTION:

MB-49036: Allow ReviveDocument to be used with durability

`subdoc_executor` ensures that a subdoc operation with ReviveDocument
set is not operating on a document which is Alive (not deleted).

However, as part of `subdoc_update`, the document state was overwritten
with Alive prior to performing an Add.

With a non-durable operation, this did not lead to issues; with a
durable op it is expected that the operation will ewouldblock, and
later be resumed.

Once the sync write has completed, `subdoc_executor` will be executed
again, and would fail the operation with

 SubdocCanOnlyReviveDeletedDocuments

as the state had been set to Alive.
