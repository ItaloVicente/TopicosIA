DESCRIPTION:

MB-47933: Abort warmup if KVStore scan errors encountered

During investigation of MB-47790, it was found that a similar issue
exists with Warmup - namely that if any disk errors (e.g couchstore
file corruption) are encountered during disk scans, those errors are
not correctly detected and propagated, meaning that Warmup continues
onwards, ignoring the missing data.

There are four phases of warmup which perform range scans (and are
affected by this in slightly different ways):

* LoadPreparedSyncWrites: If a scan() error occurs here then one or
  more prepares can be skipped and not loaded from disk. This
  potentially results in dataloss of SyncWrites which were previously
  Committed (assuming they were committed but the commit wasn't
  persisted to disk before the restart).

* KeyDump (Value-Eviction): If a scan() error occurs here then all
  keys not yet scanned are not loaded into the HashTable; and are
  considered not to exist - effectively data-loss.

* LoadingData (Value-Eviction): If a scan() error occurs here then all
  values not yet scanned are not loaded. This is essentially benign;
  while residency ratio will be lower than expected there's no loss of
  data. A subsequent backfill to read the value (post-warmup) will
  likely also fail (assuming disk error isn't transient) and should
  result in auto-failover if disk failures enabled as a trigger.

* LoadingKVPairs (Full-Eviction): Similar to LoadingData; data will
  not be loaded during warmup, but give it's full-eviction would
  trigger a bgfetch if a client subsequently requested a particular
  document which wasn't loaded at warmup.

Address this by correctly checking for any errors during scan for all
three phases, if any errors encountered them stop warmup at that
point.
