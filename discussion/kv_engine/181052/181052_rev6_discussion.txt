DESCRIPTION:

MB-53920: Rename Full into FullAndNeedsRecovery

In preparation for reintroducing Full by different semantic.
When reintroduced, Full will indicate a state where the overall
checkpoint allocation in the system has hit the CheckpointQuota but we
don't want to trigger mem-recovery from CM.
