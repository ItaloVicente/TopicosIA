DESCRIPTION:

MB-33389: Remove support for old (pre-5.0) vbstate upgrade

In preparartion for refactoring of vbucket_state serialization /
deserialization, and adding support for persisting replication
topology, remove support for parsing persisted vbucket_state from
before v5.5.0.

Details: A number of vbucket_state fields which were not part of the
original struct and were added over time. Previously these were
permitted to not exist (i.e. if the couchstore file was from an
offline upgrade from a version which didn't support the field).

However for v6.0.0 we only support upgrade (offline or online) from
v5.0.0 or later - therefore all fields which are supported (written)
by 5.0.0 can be assumed to exist.

This patch just updates the test helpers which write "downlevel"
_local/vbstate docs to add all fields which are guaranteed to be
present in v5.0.0 upwards. Subseequent patches which refactor the
serialization / deserialization of vbucket_state can then assume they
are always present and hence simplify the work needed.
