DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Initial RangeScan infrastructure

This commit adds very basic RangeScan support and supporting tests.

A RangeScan object is defined which is an object that is intended to
be created in response to a range-scan request command. The object
itself will then be driven through various states by a mixture of
I/O tasks (opening and scanning disk) and frontend threads requesting
create/continue/cancel.

A RangeScans object is defined that will be the owner of all scans
against a vbucket, forming the controller of the lifetime of scan.

The code in range_scan_test shows the current abilities of this commit,
configuring a scans for various ranges and also checking a number of
invariants regarding the ordering of client operations.
