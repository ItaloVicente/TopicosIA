DESCRIPTION:

MB-48038: Don't execute CursorDrop/CheckpointRemoval if not needed

Similar to http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/160153 where we
avoid to attempt any checkpoint mem-recovery if the memory state in
checkpoints doesn't require it, here we avoid to attempt CursorDrop
/ CheckpointRemoval if the previous ItemExpel step has already
release enough memory.

This patch also fixes a bug introduced at
http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/160152 that may cause a
CheckpointVisitor to be constructed with memToRelease=0, which may fail
some assertion and crash memcached.
