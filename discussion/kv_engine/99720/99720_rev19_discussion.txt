DESCRIPTION:

MB-27235: Increase frequency count on mutations

Whenever we update the value of an item in the hash table we want to
increase its frequency count.

This will ensure that items that are frequently mutated are identified
as being hot and so less likely to be selected as a candidate for
eviction.
