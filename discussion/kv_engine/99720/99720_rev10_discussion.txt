DESCRIPTION:

MB-27235: Increase frequency count on mutations

Whenever we perform a set, replace or add we want to increase the
frequency count of the item if it already exists in the hash table.

This will ensure that items that are frequently mutated are identified
as being hot and so less likely to be selected as a candidate for
eviction.

Line:289, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> As the comment says "this should increase the frequency count", so probably we should check the freq_counter at every cycle

Line:296, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Maybe we could use EXPECT_LT ? 
so we check also that the freq_counter is changing in the expected direction

Line:303, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> ditto

Line:310, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> ditto

Line:317, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> ditto

Line:324, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> ditto

Line:289, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Because we use a statistical counter - we cannot guarantee that the counter will increment after 1 set.  Have added a comment to explain this.

Line:296, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Done

Line:303, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> see comment above
