DESCRIPTION:

MB-27235: Increase frequency count on mutations

Whenever we perform a set, replace or add we want to increase the
frequency count of the item if it already exists in the hash table.

This will ensure that items that are frequently mutated are identified
as being hot and so less likely to be selected as a candidate for
eviction.
