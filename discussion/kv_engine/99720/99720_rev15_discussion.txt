DESCRIPTION:

MB-27235: Increase frequency count on mutations

Whenever we update the value of an item in the hash table we want to
increase its frequency count.

This will ensure that items that are frequently mutated are identified
as being hot and so less likely to be selected as a candidate for
eviction.

Line:941, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Nit: actually a reference but...

Line:300, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Isn't it possible (however unlikely) that 10 sets could be insufficient to increase the freq counter value?

If so, I suggest you restructure the test to call store_item() in a while loop until the freq Counter changes from the initial value - perhaps with a backstop limit (1M iterations?) so we don't hang if there is some bug?

Line:307, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Same here.

Line:941, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Done

Line:300, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Yes agreed, change the code as suggested.  See backstop limit to 1000 as that should be a lot more than required.

Line:307, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Done
