DESCRIPTION:

MB-27235: Increase frequency count on mutations

Whenever we perform a set, replace or add we want to increase the
frequency count of the item if it already exists in the hash table.

This will ensure that items that are frequently mutated are identified
as being hot and so less likely to be selected as a candidate for
eviction.

Line:876, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Nit: I'd probably rename this to something like `updateFreqCounter()` or `markValueAccessed()`.

The "attempt" (as I read it) implies that the function might not succeed; whereas the fact it's a probabilistic counter is really an implementation detail; the caller doesn't really need to know that the raw internal value might not change.

Line:939, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Please document this new method.
