DESCRIPTION:

MB-54866: Inject non-elided task and bucket names on the call stack

Adds a new utility class called DebugVariable which uses folly's
compiler_must_not_elide to allow values to be kept around on the stack,
and uses that to put the name of the taskable and the name of the
task that is being run on the program stack, so that they are available
in crash dumps.
