DESCRIPTION:

MB-26470: Active stream to hold only a weak_ptr to producer conn

Currently active stream holds a shared_ptr to its producer conn
and the producer conn holds shared_ptr to all its streams.
When a DcpConnMap is deleted without explicitly closing all its
connections, there is a cyclic reference between producer conn
and its streams.

Hence, this commit converts the shared_ptr (to producer) held by
the active stream to weak_ptr. It also adds a test case that
demonstrates the memory when run with address sanitizer.

Line:357, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Style: You don't need to explicitly construct a std::string - you can assign to std::string from a string literal.

Line:363, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> (Possible follow-up task) Note this should logically never happen - it's a state which isn't valid for active streams. 

The correct way to address IMHO would be to change `state_` so it's a member of each subclass (ActiveStream, PassiveStream etc), and then use a different StreamState for each subclass. That would allow you to remove all of this code.

Line:491, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> If we can't get the producer, I assume that means that the stream is in the process of being shutdown - in which case shouldn't we just return from the function as this point?

Line:618, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> As previous - if we can't get a producer, shouldn't we return immediately?

Line:893, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Don't put else after return - https://github.com/couchbase/memcached/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#don-t-use-else-after-a-return

Line:1210, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Same comment as previous.

Line:1448, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Same comment as previously.

In fact you can simplify this a lot - 

 std::string connHeader = producer ? producer->logHeader() 
                                   : "DCP (Producer): **Deleted conn**""

Line:1699, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Style: You can remove a bunch of duplication by re-writing this to a single condition:

 bool inverse = false;
 if (force || itemsReady.compare_exchange_strong(inverse, true)) {
     producer->notifyStreamReady(vb_);
 }

Line:428, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> Please document this function.

Line:41, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_ep_engine.h -> Remove this - suggest you instead wait on the appropriate state (sleeps in tests are always a pain - that sleep might not be long enough, and if you make it longer and longer the test will just end up running slow).

Line:2167, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Can you make use of the existing mock (SynchronousEPEngine) to simplify the task handling here - and not require the creation of the new MockEPEngine)?

Whatever you decide, we need to have this test enabled as otherwise it's basically a waste of time - we aren't demonstrating the race.

Line:507, programs/engine_testapp/mock_server.cc -> Not sure removing these is safe - I think you'll introduce races elsewhere.

Line:357, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Done

Line:363, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Yup, will make a note for the follow-up task

Line:491, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> I wanted to keep the change minimal. But I see no harm in returning from here if producer is not found. Will change to do so

Line:618, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> This function is called from producer->step() and hence producer is always present here.
Ideally we should have passed the producer reference along the call stack, I tried doing the change that way, but saw that it would lead to lot of code changes.

And also, since this function is under the stream lock, let it just run fully as it is updating bunch of stats/variables after getting the nextQueuedItem().

Line:893, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Done

Line:1210, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Again here, since this is endStream, that is, stream will transition to dead subsequently, I think it should run irrespective of the producer being there or not.

Line:1448, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Done

Line:1699, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Done

Line:428, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> Done

Line:41, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_ep_engine.h -> Deleting this class

Line:2167, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Ok using SynchronousEPEngine now

Line:507, programs/engine_testapp/mock_server.cc -> Sorry, I was supposed to delete the lock I added in mock_notify_io_complete(), but deleted this by mistake.
Will fix it

Yes, ASaan will flag an error if the ActiveStream holds a shared_ptr (not weak) to the proudcer
Line:618, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> I can maybe just do for the call stack of this function, but it will not serve the purpose because same is true with all the stream functions called from the producer.

So I think, passing producer for all the stream functions called from the producer can be another refactor task.

Line:618, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Ok - while I'd prefer not to introduce this complexity here I concede it might increase the scope of this patch significantly.

How about this - leave the structure as-is; but add throw a logic_error if producer is null, so we verify our assumptions (and will know if you're wrong ;)

Unless it's absolutely huge, I'd suggest making that change - then it's clear to the reader that the producer is guaranteed to be valid - and it simplifies the code here. 

(IMHO it's better to make a large number of "simple" code changes, if it results in overall cleaner code, particulary in complex areas like resource ownership.
