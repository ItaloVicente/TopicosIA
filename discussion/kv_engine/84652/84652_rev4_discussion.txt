DESCRIPTION:

MB-26470: Active stream to hold only a weak_ptr to producer conn

Currently active stream holds a shared_ptr to its producer conn
and the producer conn holds shared_ptr to all its streams.
When a DcpConnMap is deleted without explicitly closing all its
connections, there is a cyclic reference between producer conn
and its streams.

Hence, this commit converts the shared_ptr (to producer) held by
the active stream to weak_ptr. It also adds a test case that
demonstrates the memory when run with address sanitizer.
