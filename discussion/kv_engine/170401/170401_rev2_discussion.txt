DESCRIPTION:

MB-49489: Add Magma bloom filter memory quota

Currently magma's bloom filters use ~1 byte per key
and can't be evicted. They are accounted for in sizing magma's
write cache and block cache ie. if bloom filters exceed the
10% magma memory quota, block cache quota is set to zero and
write cache will only store one batch at a time.

At very low dgm, it is possible for the bloom filters
to consume a significant proportion of the bucket memory
quota. If we have lots of small items, it can result in a case
where bloom filters consume most of the bucket memory quota
before we hit the 1% dgm mark and we hang.

This change adds an additional bloom filter quota after
which magma will start permanent background eviction of
the bloom filters. This will significantly affect performance
and should only kick in to avoid hanging. The quota is set
to 40% of the bucket quota to prevent the hang, in tests
we found that we hang once the bloom filter memory usage
reaches around 75% of quota.
