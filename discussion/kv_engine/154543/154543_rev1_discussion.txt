DESCRIPTION:

MB-46592: Catch exceptions that may occur inside logExecutionException

The MB identified that calls to "toJSON" whilst handling an "execute"
exception have been seen to throw a further std::exception, this is
not caught and leads to memcached being terminated.

The fix wraps the code that is building a detailed exception in
a try/catch which then leads to a simpler attempt of logging
the error.

Line:662, daemon/connection.cc -> Not a big deal, but I don't really see what the lambda function adds over just changing the catch... to be std::exception?

Line:662, daemon/connection.cc -> yep, ps2! I'd missed bad_alloc's relation to std::exception - simpler in ps2

Line:681, daemon/connection.cc -> Suggest we also add a global catch (...) to ensure nothing else takes us down.
