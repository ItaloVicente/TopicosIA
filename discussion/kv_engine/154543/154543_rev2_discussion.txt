DESCRIPTION:

MB-46592: Catch exceptions that may occur inside logExecutionException

The MB identified that calls to "toJSON" whilst handling an "execute"
exception have been seen to throw a further std::exception, this is
not caught and leads to memcached being terminated.

The fix wraps the code that is building a detailed exception in
a try/catch which then leads to a simpler attempt of logging
the error.
