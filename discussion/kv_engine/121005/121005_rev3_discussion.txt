DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Add ability to explicitly position a cursor in CM

This patch exposes a new CM::positionCursorAt() interface for allowing
the user to perform an explicit cursor-move.
That is supposed to happen when the user call
getItemsForCursor(CursorMove::DEFERRED), which returns also the deferred
position for cursor.

Line:1015, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Is this sufficient? If the cursor has moved between checkpoints, won't the cursor counts in the old and new checkpoint need decr/incr? Otherwise the old checkpoint will remain reffed when the cursor isn't actually "in" it anymore?

Though alternatively, in the case of the persistence cursor, move assignment might keep it all tidy -

e.g.,
 void doTheThing(CheckpointCursor&& theCopiedCursor) {
     *persistenceCursor = std::move(theCopiedCursor);
 }

With something a bit like that you could rely on the move assignment to decr the old checkpoint before replacing itself with the copied cursor. An incr wouldn't be needed explicitly, when the cursor was copied it did an incr, and would have decr/incred every time it moved from one checkpoint to the next.

Line:1015, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> You're right, this is definitely not sufficient as the result of this operation should be equivalent to doing incrCursor() up to the new position.

Line:1015, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Double checked on this, and it seems ok that we just set the position.
At CM::getItemsForCursor():

1) we copy the cursor -> this incrNumCursor for the current checkpoint
2) we move the copy -> this incr/decrNumCursor for all checkpoints traversed
3) the copy is destroyed -> we decrNumCursor for the last checkpoint visited by copy

It seems correct. Note that we must increase the numCursor in checkpoints to prevent checkpoint removal until the deferred-move is performed.

Line:1015, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Sticking with the simplest solution for now: 

    while (cursor.currentPos != pos) {
        incrCursor(cursor);
    }

The work for making the numCursors count correct on checkpoint is not that complex but quite risky. Also, this code is used only at persistence so IO will always dominate on this (note that the time spent in this while-loop is proportional to numItemsForCursor; also, we are not supposed to have many checkpoints around in a healthy system).

Line:1015, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I'd be wary - not sure that it is an issue, but cursors can get moved around under you e.g.,

 kv_engine/engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc:290

Will move a currentPos backward when replacing the currently-pointed-to item.

Haven't checked it is possible, but I'd be cautious of events lining up just right to lead to one cursor "jumping" over the other.

Line:1015, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Actually I m more concerned about deduplication..
What happens if:
1) M:1
2) CM::getItemsForCursor(DEFERRED) -> it returns iterator to M:1
3) front-end enqueues M:2 -> deduplicates M:1
4) CM::positionCursorAt(M:1)
?

The problem is that many things can happen in the checkpoint once we have released the CM::queueLock at step (2)..

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1015, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Triple checked :)


- Yes, the incr/decr done by moving the copy is correct and necessary for what I ve mentioned above


- No, just replacing the position here is not enough as it messes up the cursorCount on checkpoints. That the reason why come checkpoint removal tests fail by "checkpoint not removed" in the follow-up patch where I use this code
