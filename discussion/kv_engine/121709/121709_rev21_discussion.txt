DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Introduce the "backup persistence cursor" in CM

We introduce the concept of "backup persistence cursor" for getting rid
of the (old) broken VBucket::rejectQueue.

The main reason behind the rejectQueue was the way getItemsForCursor()
works:
  1) move the cursor forward
  2) pick-up the item
  3) repeat (1) until we get all (or up to a limit) items for cursor
  4) return items
Given that the cursor has moved, if the flusher fails we cannot rely on
the CM for retrieving again the same items.
So, the rejectQueue was used at flush to re-queueing all the items of a
failed flush-batch and pulling them from the queue when re-attempting
the flush.

With the new backup pcursor we do exactly the same as before in
getItemsForCursor(). But (only for persistence) we register a copy of
the cursor before the cursor move. Then:
  1) if flush succeeds, we just remove the copy
  2) if flush fails, we reset the pcursor to the copy

That allows to rely entirely on the CM for re-attemping the flush after
failure.

In this patch the backup cursor is already used at
EPBucket::flushVBucket. That fixes the issue tracked in this MB (ie, new
persisted vbstate could be lost at re-attempting flush after storage
failure at replica). The fix is covered by test.

@todo in follow-ups:
 - test backup pcursor placed at different queue_op
 - test backup pcursor and reset at Checkpoint deduplication
 - test all pcursor reset code-paths at flush
 - remove all the reject-queue code

Line:42, /COMMIT_MSG -> Do we have all these done now?

Line:176, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> I'm a little nervous in changing the name of a cursor once it is created, given various things in CheckpointManager use a name to manage cursors. 

What's the reason for adding this?

Line:368, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> As per previous comment I think we should avoid the setName method. Just add a constructor which takes two parameters (existing Cursor, new name).

Line:379, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> An Expects() is like an assert() - it could be elided if not enabled at compile-time. Therefore don't put anything with side-effects inside an Expects().

Line:805, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> This feels over-complex - this is a lot of extra logic to basically say "are there non-persistence cursors in oldest closet checkpoint?"

This is also why I suggested adding a property to the CheckpointCursor object - "isDroppable" or similar which is false for persistence and persistence-backup. Then code like this can simply be done in terms of testing for properties.

Line:165, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Why a unique_ptr? can't we use value semantics here?

Line:238, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> The 'P' almost gets lost in the name here. Suggest spelling Persistence out fully to make it more readable.

Line:459, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Style: prefer naming boolean functions with an `is` or `has` prefix or similar (methods should read as verb phrases - doFoo, hasBar, isBaz...).

Line:577, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> as previous - please expand.

Line:21, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Can we remove this from vbucket.h? The interface of VBucket shouldn't care about CheckpointManager.

Line:581, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> As per above comment, if this is forcing us to pull in all of checkpoint_manager then maybe move PendingFlushHandle into checkpoint_types.h or similar.

Line:42, /COMMIT_MSG -> Almost all covered in the follow-ups.

The only partial coverage is for the first point (backup cursor placed and reset at any queue_op). We have coverage for backup cursor placed at mutation and set-vbstate, and we check that pcursor is reset correctly in those cases.
Note that the logic for creating and resetting the cursor deals with iterators, queue_op is not involved at all. But I can definitely expand at http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/121950/.

Line:368, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> fixing

Line:379, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> fixing

Line:805, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I think that I can simplify a bit this function.
I gave a try to isDroppable in Cursor but it leads to changing more code around (register() functions etc..), while avoiding cursor-dropping for backup-cursor is a 2-line change (see getListOfCursorsToDrop() above)

Line:165, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Some points:

1) As a RAII resource, PendingFlushHandle calls back into the CM in the dtor.

2) An instance of PendingFlushHandle is created in CM and returned back to the caller.

3) We want to trigger the callback only once and only at the caller.


So, an instance of PendingFlushHandle has logically a single (unique) owner. The callback must be triggered only when the owner goes out-of-scope.


We could implement that by move-semantic. But, a pure move is not enough, as is doesn't prevent the dtor (of move-from object) from being executed.
So, we would need to add further state to the Handle (something like 'bool valid'). In the dtor we perform our operations only if valid==true. At move, we set valid=false for the move-from object.


But look: what I ve just describe is exactly the move-semantic of a std::unique_ptr !


Here we could probably rename PendingFlushHandle to SomethingElse, and then:

    using PendingFlushHandle = std::unique_ptr<SomethingElse>;

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:805, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Mmm I've (re)tried to simplify this logic but that seems the minimum amount of checks.

But, how Cursor::isDroppable is going to help here?
It seems to me that the logic in this function would stay pretty much the same.
