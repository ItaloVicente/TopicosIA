DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Introduce the "backup persistence cursor" in CM

We introduce the concept of "backup persistence cursor" for getting rid
of the (old) broken VBucket::rejectQueue.

The main reason behind the rejectQueue was the way getItemsForCursor()
works:
  1) move the cursor forward
  2) pick-up the item
  3) repeat (1) until we get all (or up to a limit) items for cursor
  4) return items
Given that the cursor has moved, if the flusher fails we cannot rely on
the CM for retrieving again the same items.
So, the rejectQueue was used at flush to re-queueing all the items of a
failed flush-batch and pulling them from the queue when re-attempting
the flush.

With the new backup pcursor we do exactly the same as before in
getItemsForCursor(). But (only for persistence) we register a copy of the
cursor before the cursor move. Then:
  1) if flush succeeds, we just remove the copy
  2) if flush fails, we rollback the pcursor to the copy

That allows to rely entirely on the CM for re-attemping the flush after
failure.

In this patch the backup cursor is already used at
EPBucket::flushVBucket. That fixes the issue tracked in this MB (ie, new
persisted vbstate could be lost at re-attempting flush after storage
failure). The fix is covered by test.

@todo in follow-ups:
 - test backup pcursor rollback at different queue_op
 - test backup pcursor and rollback at Checkpoint deduplication
 - remove all the reject-queue code

We must check that the backup copy is placed at the empty item

Line:382, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I didn't even think of any optimization here, just focus on correctness for now.
Note that this code is executed only at flush and only in the case of flush failure.

haven't looked at the tests yet
Line:25, /COMMIT_MSG -> long line

Line:393, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> comment about how this is necessary for ref counting

Line:535, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> would be nice do this in getItemsForPersistence()?
I guess you didn't because we don't take queueLock until getItemsForCursor though

Does all this logic about backup cursors belong in CheckpointManager? It feels like it's probably something which should just be done in flushVBucket(), using primitives provided by CheckpointManager (e.g. copyCursor / assignCursor)

In other words, CheckpointManager shouldn't need to know anything about the whole concept of rollback, just expand some of the things you can do with cursors like copy / reassign them.

Good point.
I would say that most of the logic (register/remove cursor) belongs to the CM.
But I imagine that with "all this logic" you refer to the logic that triggers the creation of the "backup cursor".
Currently the CM triggers the creation of backup-cursor (every time a move of pcursor is requested)

Actually we have an asymmetry here: the flusher knows about the backup cursor as it has to remove it at some point.. but the creation of the backup cursor is not triggered by the flusher.

Maybe you want to fix the asymmetry by exposing an explicit CM::registerBackupPCursor() ?

At that point the flusher will do:
1) CM::registerBackupPCursor()
2) CM::getItemsForPersistence()
3) CM::removeBackupPCursor() or CM::rollbackPersistenceCursor() (depending on whether the flush succeeds or fails)

Mmm re-thinking about it, and probably what you described is something that would apply more to DCP than persistence.
Logically the CM owns the persistence-cursor.
Technically the CM own every cursor (also the DCP ones). But, ActiveStream triggers the creation of its cursor (eg, AS also provides the name for that cursor), while the persistence-cursor lifetime is entirely managed internally in the CM. The p-cursor is created at CM::ctor.

I think that what you described would be surely the right thing to do if the p-cursor lifetime was managed like the DCP cursor lifetime. Eg, the flusher registers a p-cursor into every CM of vbuckets that it manages (as per sharding), etc..

I'm not saying that what you propose is wrong. Just that what I do in this patch for backup-pcursor follows the same logic of what we do with p-cursor.
That's true at least at cursor creation. Actually removing the backup cursor needs to be triggered by the flusher as the CM doesn't know what to do otherwise (removing the backup-cursor or rolling back to it?).
