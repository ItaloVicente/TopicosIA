DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Introduce the "backup persistence cursor" in CM

We introduce the concept of "backup persistence cursor" for getting rid
of the (old) broken VBucket::rejectQueue.

The main reason behind the rejectQueue was the way getItemsForCursor()
works:
  1) move the cursor forward
  2) pick-up the item
  3) repeat (1) until we get all (or up to a limit) items for cursor
  4) return items
Given that the cursor has moved, if the flusher fails we cannot rely on
the CM for retrieving again the same items.
So, the rejectQueue was used at flush to re-queueing all the items of a
failed flush-batch and pulling them from the queue when re-attempting
the flush.

With the new backup pcursor we do exactly the same as before in
getItemsForCursor(). But (only for persistence) we register a copy of
the cursor before the cursor move. Then:
  1) if flush succeeds, we just remove the copy
  2) if flush fails, we rollback the pcursor to the copy

That allows to rely entirely on the CM for re-attemping the flush after
failure.

In this patch the backup cursor is already used at
EPBucket::flushVBucket. That fixes the issue tracked in this MB (ie, new
persisted vbstate could be lost at re-attempting flush after storage
failure). The fix is covered by test.

@todo in follow-ups:
 - test backup pcursor rollback at different queue_op
 - test backup pcursor and rollback at Checkpoint deduplication
 - remove all the reject-queue code

Hmm, patch was updated while I was reviewing, some of these might not apply :P
Line:99, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> I'm curious as to what clang-tidy would suggest regarding arg by-cref and copy vs by-value and move :shrug: (thinking about the modernize-pass-by-value check).
(not a -1 at all, just thinking about what is favoured)

Line:400, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Hmm, I'm wondering if we could get away without a make_shared by just swapping the two existing cursors - something like

 auto* copy = cursors.at(backupPCursorName).get();
 std::swap(*copy, *persistenceCursor);

 // Remove old pcursor
 Expects(removeCursor_UNLOCKED(copy));
 persistenceCursor->setName(pCursorName);

If that works, it saves altering pCursor too :shrug:

As far as I can tell that should be "safe" given that no one else should be concurrently using either cursor

Line:204, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Might be worth putting "persistence cursor" the first time it is mentioned in a doc comment then abbreviate it after that, for the sake of clarity e.g., for future new joiners

Line:211, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> What should a caller do if this method returns false? If failure is truly exceptional here, throwing might be a good call.

Edit: from reading the .cc it looks like it would only return false if the cursor is null - it seems like it would be a fair precondition to expect the cursor exists if this method is called

Line:473, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> todo :P

Line:545, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> nit "re-attempting"

Line:691, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> The explanation of why there is a backup cursor is great, but I'm not sure about having a comment refer to the way things "were before".

With the rejectQueue going away, specifically noting it here means new readers might go off digging to find out what it did to understand the context of this - and this comment might be around for years :P

The parts describing what it does now and why are plenty of information :)

Line:2440, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Could check that the pos iterator == the original pos iterator (but that might be a bit belt and braces)

Thanks for review James, I put a -1 on this as needs to be reviewed in some parts.
Line:400, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Mmm need to double check but I think that with a swap we don't get the numCursors right in checkpoints.
Also, CM::pCursor and CM::persistenceCursor must be both reset.
Note that this is execute at persistence and only if flush fails, so perf here is a minor issue.

Line:400, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Just on the point of numCursors being correct, if move is implemented as a true logical move
e.g.,


 CheckpointCursor b = std::move(a);

leaves you with 1 valid cursor (b) and one invalid moved-out-of invalid cursor (a)

then, starting with two valid cursors a and b

 std::swap(a, b);

(which if unspecialized relies on move assignment IIRC)

will leave you with exactly two valid cursors afterward.
A temporary may be created in the process, but there will _not_ be more than two _valid_ cursors at a time. considering a trivial swap implementation

// two valid cursors: a in ckpt 1, b in ckpt 2
CheckpointCursor tmp = std::move(a);
// two valid cursors: tmp in ckpt 1, b in ckpt 2
a = std::move(b);
// two valid cursors: a in ckpt 2, tmp in ckpt 1
b = std::move(tmp);
// two valid cursors: a in ckpt 2, b in ckpt 1

If the cursors are swapped, there are the same number of cursors in each checkpoint they were in before and after.

But it's perfectly fine as-is, it was simply a suggestion for clarity when reading :)

IIRC CM::pCursor is essentially just a weak ptr, and CM::persistenceCursor is a raw ptr; after

 std::swap(*persistenceCursor, *backupPCursor);

pCursor and persistenceCursor will both point to the same object _as each other_, the same location in memory as before, but since that object has just been swapped, the object they point to has the data which _used_ to be in the backup cursor.

Which can be contrasted with just swapping the pointers

 std::swap(persistenceCursor, backupPCursor);

But I'm just mentioning this here to explain my understanding of why it would "do the right thing", not to suggest it needs to change.

It it is entirely fine as it is currently :)
