DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Introduce the "backup persistence cursor" in CM

We introduce the concept of "backup persistence cursor" for getting rid
of the (old) broken VBucket::rejectQueue.

The main reason behind the rejectQueue was the way getItemsForCursor()
works:
  1) move the cursor forward
  2) pick-up the item
  3) repeat (1) until we get all (or up to a limit) items for cursor
  4) return items
Given that the cursor has moved, if the flusher fails we cannot rely on
the CM for retrieving again the same items.
So, the rejectQueue was used at flush to re-queueing all the items of a
failed flush-batch and pulling them from the queue when re-attempting
the flush.

With the new backup pcursor we do exactly the same as before in
getItemsForCursor(). But (only for persistence) we register a copy of
the cursor before the cursor move. Then:
  1) if flush succeeds, we just remove the copy
  2) if flush fails, we rollback the pcursor to the copy

That allows to rely entirely on the CM for re-attemping the flush after
failure.

In this patch the backup cursor is already used at
EPBucket::flushVBucket. That fixes the issue tracked in this MB (ie, new
persisted vbstate could be lost at re-attempting flush after storage
failure). The fix is covered by test.

@todo in follow-ups:
 - test backup pcursor rollback at different queue_op
 - test backup pcursor and rollback at Checkpoint deduplication
 - remove all the reject-queue code

Line:88, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> @DR
The original idea was to use a generic CursorHolder that stores a Cursor* and operate on that.
I m abs happy with that solution, but actually we want to use this class only for managing the lifetime of the backup-pcursor, so this seems a feasible alternative.

Note about the naming: CursorHolder is good for the original solution. I don't like CursorCallback for this (as it doesn't mean anything ! ), looking for inspiration for a good name :)

Line:88, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Couple of suggestions:

* PendingFlushHandle - then you could rename the method to signal failure as `markFlushFailed()
* StagedFlushHandle - similar name for signalling failure.

... or anything else you think is better...
