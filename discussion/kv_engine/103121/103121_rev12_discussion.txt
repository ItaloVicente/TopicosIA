DESCRIPTION:

MB-31266: Count system events

Update the hash-table stats to include items which
are system-event items, for ephemeral buckets this
enables us to provide an more accurate curr_items
statistic which is not inflated by the system
events.

A deleted system event (tombstone) is still tracked
as a system event, no differentiation of alive/deleted.

For persistent buckets more work is needed and is tracked
as MB-26334.
