DESCRIPTION:

MB-25820: Don't generate two responses for streamRequest

If a streamRequest is made to a dead vbucket we generated two results
(ENGINE_SUCESS) followed by the correct result (NOT_MY_VBUCKET)

The reason was that we perform addFailoverLog, before checking if the
vbucket is dead.  addFailoverLog has the side-effect of invoking a
callback function, which is passed as a parameter to addFailoverLog.
The callback function invokes mcbp_response_handler and so generates
the response (ENGINE_SUCCESS).  We then continue the execution of the
streamRequest method and generate the second response
(ENGINE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET).

This patch separates out the invocation of the callback function from
addFailoverLog. (addFailoverLog is renamed getFailoverLog).
The callback invocation is then moved to after all of the error
checking cases.

A test is added to ensure that in the dead vbucket senario the callback
function is not invoked.

General approach looks good; couple of implementation suggestions.
Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> sp: SUCCESS

Line:343, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Given you're changing this, would be more idiomatic Modern C++ to just have getFailoverLog() return the vector of entries.

Line:449, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Style: you can also use failoverEntries.data() - which is perhaps clearer.

Line:283, engines/ep/src/failover-table.cc -> Style: You can save the temporary (and also make the code simpler) by constructing each value into the vector directly:

 data.emplace_back(entry);

... or if you want to go full-on functional, simply construct the vector from iterators to the start and end :)

 std::vector<vbucket_failover_t> result{ std::begin(table), std::end(table) };

Line:211, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Does this need to be static - can't we do with a normal member variable?

Line:449, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Done

Line:283, engines/ep/src/failover-table.cc -> As discussed will use: result.emplace_back(entry.vb_uuid, entry.by_seqno);

Line:211, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> unfortunately needs to be static as its used inside the static function fakeDcpAddFailoverLog.  Have added a comment to clarify why its static.
