DESCRIPTION:

MB-47009: Disable filtered streams and sync-replication

Following the changes to fix MB-47009 it's noted that sync-writes
and filtered streams have little to no test coverage and some issues
to address in the code, particularly around the lack of seqno advance.

Raised MB-47877 to track any work for enabling these two features.
