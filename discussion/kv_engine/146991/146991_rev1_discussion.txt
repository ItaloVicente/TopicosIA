DESCRIPTION:

MB-44079: Add new committed states

Add two new committed states so that we can identift which committed
items can be purged and which cannot. CommittedViaLogicalCompletion
is a new state which will be used for committed items received in
disk snapshot after a prepare has been received in the same disk
snapshot. CommittedViaPrepare and CommittedViaLogicalCompletion
commits will not be able to be purged (marked stale) in a future
patch. Only commits in the CommittedCanBePurged state will be
eligible for purging (marking stale)
