DESCRIPTION:

MB-34091: Manually ack seqnos for new secondChain nodes

It is possible for a new node (will exist in the new topology)
to ack before ns_server gives us a new replication topology.
ns_server does this so that we do not block SyncWrites on vBucket
streaming on the new node as this could take a long time and cause
the SyncWrites to time out. However, this means that a new node can
ack before it exists in our replication topology.

Store a map of acks for nodes that we do not know about, and use this
map on setting of the replication topology to manually ack each new
node at their highest acked seqno. This will ensure that our SyncWrites
do not timeout waiting for the secondChain to be satisfied.

Re: GC

Bit of a pain because collections allows for multiple streams per vb so I did this off disconnect. 

Have not addressed other issues yet but will.

True, however replication streams (the only ones which will be sending seqno_ack) are one per VB.

Yes, but the ActiveStream (I think) has no way of knowing if it is being used for replication. As far as I can tell we only get that information from the ConnHandler name

We use the same name for both actually so I could use that to filter in ~ActiveStream, it would however mean needing a reference to the consumerName per ActiveStream too

The producer knows it as it's negotiated via a DCP_CONTROL message - see supportsSyncReplication

Ahh cool, I thought that supportsSyncRep was only in the ConnHandler, didn't realise it was also in Streams. Will update, thanks!
