DESCRIPTION:

MB-34091: Manually ack seqnos for new nodes

It is possible for a new node (will exist in the secondChain)
to ack before ns_server gives us a new replication topology with
the secondChain. ns_server does this so that we do not block
SyncWrites on vBucket streaming on the new node as this could take a
long time and cause the SyncWrites to time out. However, this means
that a new node can ack before it exists in our replication topology.

Store a map of acks for nodes that we do not know about, and use this
map on setting of the replication topology to manually ack each new
node at their highest acked seqno. This will ensure that our SyncWrites
do not timeout waiting for the secondChain to be satisfied.

We also need to think about GC'ing the set of outstanding ACKs - what happens if a node is never added to the topology?
Line:751, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> This code is (virtually?) identical to the firstChain code. Please pull into a common helper function.

I was thinking about the GC last night. I think if we just reset after each topology change then I think that should be fine for any typical rebalance for which we would expect sync writes to work. We could also remove unknown acks on consumer disconnect instead.

I originally wanted to put a seqno in each Consumer but it meant a little more work and making things like KVBucket::setState care about even more transitions and pass a vector of name/seqno down to the DM. Maybe it's not such a bad idea for GC though

Line:711, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> The comment below is ok, but it would be good to point out that (by-logic) the unknownSeqnoAcks map cannot contain the FirstChain's active.
Which is the reason why you'll never update the HPS in this block by calling processSeqnoAck for the Active.
Note also that calling processSeqnoAck for the Active would be wrong (as essentially we would end-up updating the HPS wrongly).
Could you please add a check to avoid that in processSeqnoAck ?
