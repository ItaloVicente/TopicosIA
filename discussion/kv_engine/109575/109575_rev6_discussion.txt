DESCRIPTION:

MB-34091: Manually ack seqnos for new secondChain nodes

It is possible for a new node (will exist in the new topology)
to ack before ns_server gives us a new replication topology.
ns_server does this so that we do not block SyncWrites on vBucket
streaming on the new node as this could take a long time and cause
the SyncWrites to time out. However, this means that a new node can
ack before it exists in our replication topology.

Store a map of acks for nodes that we do not know about, and use this
map on setting of the replication topology to manually ack each new
node at their highest acked seqno. This will ensure that our SyncWrites
do not timeout waiting for the secondChain to be satisfied.

Line:789, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> This seems wrong.
If you find the node in firstChain, then you remove the ack from queue. Then, you'll miss to update secondChain if the same node is in secondChain.
Am I wrong?

Line:789, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Consider the case where we normally call ADM::State::processSeqnoAck. We do not call it for both chains even though a replica may exist in both. It should be okay to ack twice, but the logic is simpler this way as we only need to ack once

Line:789, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Oh fine, forgot the that processSeqnoAck() updates the tracking for both chains.
