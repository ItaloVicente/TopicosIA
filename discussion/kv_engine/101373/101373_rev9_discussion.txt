DESCRIPTION:

MB-30916: Fix the QueueDirtyWithManyClosedUnrefCheckpoints benchmark

A (known) regression has been introduced in MB-30916, and then spotted
in MB-31834 before we could merge the fix.
The latency regression is caused by deallocating checkpoint memory under
CM::queueLock in the CheckpointRemoverTask. When the number of
checkpoints is high, then the frontend thread may be waiting a long time
before acquiring the lock.

This benchmark guards the latency of frontend DCP operations on Consumer
in the case where the CheckpointManager contains many closed-unref
checkpoints (i.e., checkpoints eligible for removing).

Note that CBNT is supposed to track only the custom 'AvgFrontEndLatency'
metric for this benchmark, so the CBNT test list is updated accordingly.
