DESCRIPTION:

MB-54666: Replica correctly processes Disk|History snap with duplicates

No logic change necessary in PassiveStream / Checkpoint so far, test
coverage added.

Replica vbuckets are already resilient to duplicates in Disk snapshots.
First, PassiveStream doesn't enforce any restriction on that.
Also, replica checkpoints don't maintain any key-index (so deduplication
is disabled by default). That also means that mutations for the same key
(that are receined within the same logical snapshot) are queued into the
same physical checkpoint (ie, no extra checkpoint created for handling
the duplicates).
