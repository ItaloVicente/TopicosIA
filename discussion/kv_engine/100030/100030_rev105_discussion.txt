DESCRIPTION:

MB-26887: Add new methods to copy or chain data to send pipe [3/7]

Add two new methods to McbpConnection to either copy the data to
the send buffer, or add a reference to the buffer with a cleanup
function to call when libevent is done with the data.

Line:778, daemon/connection.cc -> Should this function be called with an empty data element? Would it not be better to simply throw std::invalid_argument if a user tries to call in this way (if they accidentally tried to chain an empty buffer then it's probably better to flag flag instead of silently ignoring it).

Line:785, daemon/connection.cc -> I think std::bad_alloc is too generic an exception here - if the caller if expected to do something about the exception, it should probably be something differerent they can explicitly catch.

Line:805, daemon/connection.cc -> If you change the prototype of the function to be an by-value unique_ptr, then that will enforce that this function assumes ownership (see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-uniqueptrparam).

Line:21, daemon/connection.h -> Do we need the full sendbuffer.h header here? It looks like a forward definition of SendBuffer would suffice...

Line:30, daemon/sendbuffer.cc -> Suspect this might become a bottleneck. Could you replace it with an atomic increment of clients ? - Or maybe use std::shared_ptr which already handles the increment / decrement & safe destruction.

Line:56, daemon/sendbuffer.h -> As per previous comment, change to by-value then it enforces this object now owns `itm`.

Line:57, daemon/sendbuffer.h -> Do we need this? Isn't the view always going to be the same?

Line:103, daemon/sendbuffer.h -> Suggest you replace this with a StringSendBuffer which sends std::string.

I say this because it'll likely be easier to use, and also for small strings (less than ~20 bytes) you don't need the extra heap allocation due to the Small String Optimisation.

Line:778, daemon/connection.cc -> Done

Line:785, daemon/connection.cc -> Lets look into that at a later time (if we want to try to add "graceful" recover in this case). We currently always tear down the connection for "write failures"

Line:805, daemon/connection.cc -> Sure (note that we'd still need to manually release the reference here instead of letting the unique_ptr do that as libevent is the one calling the C callback method when its done sending it)

Line:21, daemon/connection.h -> Done

Line:30, daemon/sendbuffer.cc -> Flipping to shared_ptr is a huge task and not something I'd like to do right now.

I'd like to postpone changing this logic until the end of the refactor.

Line:56, daemon/sendbuffer.h -> Done

Line:57, daemon/sendbuffer.h -> Without this the class would need to call down into the engine in order to figure it out. In most of the use cases we've already done that. 

As we evolve the engine interface to be more C++ we could use a real Item class passed along and we could have member functions to do this.

Line:103, daemon/sendbuffer.h -> I believe that the reason I added this was that I had a use case for it somewhere (where the data was already stored in a std::unique_ptr<char[]>..

Lets just keep it along for now and get rid of it at a later time.

Line:785, daemon/connection.cc -> ok

Line:30, daemon/sendbuffer.cc -> That's fine. I suggest we make a note of this code however, as I suspect it'll end up having a notable performance impact when we come to tune things.

Line:57, daemon/sendbuffer.h -> ok

Line:103, daemon/sendbuffer.h -> Sure, but if we end up using it a bunch a think we should consider replacing with StringSendBuffer to potentially save an allocation (and make easier to interoperate).
