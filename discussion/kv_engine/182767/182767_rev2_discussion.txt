DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: Fix VBucketManifestTest.duplicate_cid_different_scope

The test passes but not for the reason it is expecting. The test
tries to add the same collection but in two different scopes. This
update function returns a failure not because of the duplicate but
because no checkpoint events are created. The fix now ensures a
manifest with duplicate collections is used and triggers a validation
failure.
