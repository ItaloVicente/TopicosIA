DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: Fix VBucketManifestTest.duplicate_cid_different_scope

This test currently passes, but not for the reason it is covering.

The test expects a manifest update to fail, it does, but only because
no system-events were generated from the update. The test was
expecting an validation failure to due to a duplicate collection
(collection in different scopes).

Add the "shop1" scope before adding the collection and the test now
covers the intended validation path.
