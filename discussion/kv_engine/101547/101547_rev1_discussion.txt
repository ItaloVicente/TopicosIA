Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This doesn't really reflect what this patch does - yes it ultimately gets to turning them on, but that's not very useful subject when trying o quickly scan the changeling.

Suggest something more explicit as to what this changes.

Line:813, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> I'm a bit confused as to why we need this - given at line 805 we know this vBucket exists in the vbMap; why are we adding it here - what exact error are you trying to fix?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:813, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> using addBucket was a mistake. I just need to increment the vBucket state counter for the new state which addBucket did for me along with some other stuff that shouldn't have done anything.  Updated with an incVBStateCount method that just increments the counter
