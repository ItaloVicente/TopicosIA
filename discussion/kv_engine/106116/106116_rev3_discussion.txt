DESCRIPTION:

Push OpenTrace trace from a dedicated thread

To avoid OpenTracing to potentially block the front-end
threads while the OpenTracing module performs the operations
we'll push the context to a "list" and process those entries
in a dedicated thread.

NOTE: The code assumes that only a subset of the commands
requests OpenTracing otherwise we'll probably get lock
contention (and should migrate over to a "per thread"
list).
