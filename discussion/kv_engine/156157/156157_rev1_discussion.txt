DESCRIPTION:

MB-39745: Make RocksDBKVStore::getVBHandle const

Currently we use the same function get or create a VBHandle if one
does not exist in RocksDBKVStore. We should only be creating a
VBHandle at warmup/vBucket creation though so read only paths should
always get a VBHandle that already exists.

Split the function into two, a get and a create portion, so that read
only users can use a const correct get function and write path users
can use the getOrCreate portion. Warmup creates the vbHandles manually
already so no change is needed there.
