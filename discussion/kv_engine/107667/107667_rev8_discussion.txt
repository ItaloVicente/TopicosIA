DESCRIPTION:

MB-33715 [SR]: Track only high_prepared_seqno in ADM

The original design for Durability allowed out-of-order commits.
To achieve that, the DurabilityMonitor at Replica needed to ack both
memory/disk seqnos, and the DM at Active had to track both as well.

After design review (see DesignDoc for motivation) we have to ensure
In-Order Commits. Now a Replica acks a single strictly-monotonic
quantity (the high_prepared_seqno), so the Active needs to track a
single seqno per Replica.

Note: we don't have a full implementation of high_prepared_seqno yet. So
(as for Replica) the Active acks a Prepare only when it is persisted
(even if it is Level=Majority). That is just a temporary (but
semantically correct) pessimization.

Line:3, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> ?

Line:58, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> If this is only called infrequently (e.g. for stats etc) then safer to return a value - consider if the topology changed between someone calling this method and then attempting to use the returned value.

Line:145, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> How would this ever happen? I.e. why would a replica acknowledge greater than what seqnos the ADM knows about?

Line:271, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> The member variables of this should probably be protected or private - otherwise as soon as you call wlock() you can modify any state and break invariants.

Line:3, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Mmm, this is the old durability_monitor.cc.
Need to change it since couple of patches ago.

Line:145, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> Given the current design, you are right, as:
1) we track a single seqno
2) Replica acks as soon as SW is locally satisfied (ie, *not* at snapshot boundaries)

In fact, in my initial version of this patch I had completely removed all the "NodeAckSeqno" stuff (given that at this point write-seqno and ack-seqno will always coincide).
Here I just preferred to defer to a follow-up patch to avoid noise.
Happy to fix here if you agree.

Line:271, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> If I hide them, then DurabilityMonitor cannot access them and we need to revert this change back to when we had a double access-level for most of the DM functions, e.g.:

size_t DM::getNumTracked() const {
    return state.rlock()->getNumTracked();
}

size_t DM::state::getNumTracked() const {
    return trackedWrites.size();
}

Line:271, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> Ah ok, I didn’t spot that:)

Maybe add a comment to the top level State struct explaining why everything is just public.

Line:145, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> I forgot a point here: high_prepared_seqno accounts non-sync writes.
If a Replica blindly acks high_prepared_seqno (which is what we are doing I think), then the ack'ed seqno could *not* be present in the DM's tracked-writes.

It sounds like we need to keep this, probably better we reconsider that after we have implemented the new ack-logic at Replica.
