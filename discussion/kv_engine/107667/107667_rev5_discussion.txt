DESCRIPTION:

MB-33715 [SR]: Track only high_prepared_seqno in ADM

The original design for Durability allowed out-of-order commits.
To achieve that, the DurabilityMonitor at Replica needed to ack both
memory/disk seqnos, and the DM at Active had to track both as well.

After design review (see DesignDoc for motivation) we have to ensure
In-Order Commits. Now a Replica acks a single strictly-monotonic
quantity (the high_prepared_seqno), so the Active needs to track a
single seqno per Replica.

Note: we don't have a full implementation of high_prepared_seqno yet. So
(as for Replica) the Active acks a Prepare only when it is persisted
(even if it is Level=Majority). That is just a temporary (but semantically
correct) pessimization.

Line:167, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Remove

Line:191, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> As an aside, do we currently ensure that the current node (active) has always persisted a mutation - i.e. "majority" must always include the active node?

Line:228, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Might be worth expanding the comment to explain what the bool represents.

Line:605, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Comment needs updating to not refer to disk / memory.

Line:141, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> tracking

Line:150, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> I think it's worth keeping the larger comment you had before (or some variant of it) to make explicit the difference between NodeWriteSeqno and NodeAckSeqno

Line:152, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> Should we rename this to getHighPreparedSeqno or similar?

Line:187, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> Remove

Line:200, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> Remove

Line:150, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> Done

Line:152, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> The idea was to keep it generic as we may change what a Replica acks in the future. E.g., in the current design a Replica acks the high_prepared_seqno as soon as it is updated; maybe in the future we will need Replica acks at snapshot boundaries, or something else..
But, happy to use the "prepare-seqno" naming if that's your preference.
