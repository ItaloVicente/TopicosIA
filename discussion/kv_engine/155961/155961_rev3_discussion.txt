DESCRIPTION:

MB-29928: Implement auto controller logic for the defragmenter

Two types of controller that re-act to changes in fragmentation.
Both of the controllers though don't use just fragmentation, but
calculate a value that uses the low water mark as input. This
means we don't ramp up defragmentation if the bucket is using
very little memory.

1) auto - Use a 'static' and predictable calculation for converting
fragmentation into a reduction in sleep time.

2) auto_pid - Use a PID controller to calculate reductions in
fragmentation.

Mode 1 means that as we get more fragmented the sleep reduces. As
fragmentation returns to a lower value the sleep time increases.

Mode 2 means that once fragmentation goes over a threshold the PID
controller computers corrections for the sleep time, the longer (in real
time) we are over threshold the more we reduce sleep time. Not only is
time a factor, but also the more fragmented we become (further away from
the minimum) the PID will more aggressively reduce the sleep time.
