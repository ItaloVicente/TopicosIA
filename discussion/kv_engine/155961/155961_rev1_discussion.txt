DESCRIPTION:

MB-29928: Implement auto controller logic for the defragmenter

Two types of controller.

1) auto - Use a more predictable calculation for converting
fragmentation into a reduction in sleep time.

2) auto_pid - Use a PID controller to calculate reductions in
fragmentation.

Mode 1 basically means that as we get more fragmented the sleep
reduces, as fragmentation returns to a lower value the sleep time
increases.

Mode 2 means that once fragmentation goes over a threshold the PID
controller produces changes to the sleep time, the longer (in real
time) we are over threshold the more we reduce sleep time. This mode
also means that going further away from the threshold also produces
larger reductions in sleep time.
