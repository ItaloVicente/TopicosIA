DESCRIPTION:

MB-54279: Pause / Resume: Unlock vb_mutexes from locking thread

As part of EPBucket::prepareForPause(), all of the vb_mutexes are
lock()ed - and left locked:

a) To ensure that any in-flight VBucket writes have completed and
b) To inhibit and new writes from occurring.

Then, when the EPBucket is resumed all the vb_mutexes are unlock()ed
which allows VBucket writes to resume.

However, EPBucket::prepareForResume() is not called on the same thread
which called prepareForPause() - prepareForPause() runs on a
background NonIO thread whereas resume runs synchronously in the
front-end thread. As such, we are incorrectly unlocking a mutex from a
different thread than the one which locked it - which is Undefined
Behaviour - from cppreference.com[1]:

    void unlock();

    Unlocks the mutex.

    The mutex must be locked by the current thread of execution,
    otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

This is helpfully reported by ThreadSanitizer:

    WARNING: ThreadSanitizer: unlock of an unlocked mutex (or by a wrong thread) (pid=58528)
        #0 pthread_mutex_unlock <null> (libtsan.so.0+0x3bf9a)
        #1 __gthread_mutex_unlock(pthread_mutex_t*) c++/10.2.0/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bits/gthr-default.h:779 (memcached+0x5b594f)
        #2 std::mutex::unlock() c++/10.2.0/bits/std_mutex.h:118 (memcached+0x602555)
        #3 EPBucket::prepareForResume() kv_engine/engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc:2575 (memcached+0x84b94f)
        #4 EventuallyPersistentEngine::resume() kv_engine/engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc:7002 (memcached+0x7d52d3)
        ...

Fix by changing how we achieve inhibition of future VBucket writes:

- Introduce a EPBucket::paused flag which is set in prepareForPause
  after all vb_mutexes have been acquired (and hence all in-flight
  VBucket writes have finished), but then unlock all vb_mutexes before
  returning from prepareForPause().

- When attempting to acquire a locked VBucket, check new paused flag
  before attempting to acquire the vb_mutex - if paused is set then
  block / return early (for try() variant).

This keeps the required pause behaviour but avoids keeping vb_mutexes
locked and having to later unlock (on a different thread).
