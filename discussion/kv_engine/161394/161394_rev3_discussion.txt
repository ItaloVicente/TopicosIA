DESCRIPTION:

MB-48094: Make MagmaKVFileHandle store pointer to Magma::Snapshot

Make MagmaKVFileHandle store a pointer to the current Magma disk
snapshot. Which if unavailable due to a read only error will just get
the in memory snapshot.

This patch also refactors MagmaKVStore::getCollectionsManifestUid()
and MagmaKVStore::getCollectionStats() to use the magma snapshot pointer
to read data from local store. MagmaKVStore::getBySeqno() is also
implemented in this patch, using the MagmaKVFileHandle snapshot pointer.
