Patch Set 2:

Note we are going to conflict here for the test programs with http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/155205 (cb_add_test_executable).

One possible solution, which allows top-level "cb_xxx" functions everywhere, but only enables PCH for the kv_engine stuff would be to define a custom (directory-level) CMake property via define_property / set_property (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/define_property.html) on the kv_engine directory.

Something like CB_PRECOMPILED_HEADER_TARGET - which would have value "kv_pch" or similar. Then cb_add_test_executable would (in addition to the stuff I had in the above patch) also check if the given target has a CB_PRECOMPILED_HEADER_TARGET property, and if so use that for the PCH target to reuse.

Thanks for the heads up.

For context I think I'll rename "add_executable_with_pch" to "kv_add_executable_with_pch"/"kv_add_executable_pch".

A simple CB_PRECOMPILED_HEADER_TARGET wouldn't just work as we need to select the object with the correct fPIC flag. I get the feeling that using the same fPIC setting everywhere won't just work but haven't looked into it as selecting one of two targets was the path of least resistance. Perhaps a CB_PRECOMPILED_HEADER_TARGET and CB_PRECOMPILED_HEADER_PIC_TARGET would be fine, we only seem to need the two types of precompiled header target at the moment. This feels less clear/consistent though than creating a "kv_add_test_executable_with_pch(target)" which lets any future user just chain up the cmake "...add_executable..." functions as they'd need to be aware of the directory level properties (although comments could explain it away to some extent).

Ideally a target should just set once the fact it's PIC (or not) and the fact it wants to use precompiled headers (or not) and things "magically" work. The idiomatic CMake way to do that is setting appropriate properties on it, potentially wrapping the decision of what to set where in a suitable function.

Regarding the PIC / non-PIC - you can have a single library target but which has different files to use for different properties - see for example http://review.couchbase.org/c/tlm/+/151983/1/cmake/Modules/FindCouchbaseFolly.cmake although that might get complicated.

The problem I see with 'kv_add_test_executable_with_pch()' is when we need _another_ orthogonal property on a target - then it get very wordy / the matrix of options expands a lot. 

The other approach would be to how Jim enabled Unity - just have a function which adds the appropriate property to an existing target  - which you already have with kv_enable_pch().

(Note I _need_ to use a function for cb_add_test_executable as I have to affect how the actual target is defined; adding EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL to the underlying add_executable() call - in your instance I don't believe you need kv_add_executable_pch or similar given you're just applying properties after the fact.

True, I debated whether or not the "...add_executable_with_pch()" was a good idea or not when I was rebasing your original changes vs just adding "kv_enable_pch()" to all the targets. It felt easier to remember to add pch to new targets with this method so I went with it. I think to keep the cmake simple I'll just set kv_enable_pch() everywhere instead (same style as unity build)
