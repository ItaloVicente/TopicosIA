DESCRIPTION:

[testapp] Dump part of the log for test failures

When trying to clean up with an error exit code try to dump
the last 8k of all log files found (we're cycling on 200MB
so we should only have a single log file).

That may give the user a clue on why the test failed (this
won't work very well if you run all tests in memcached_testapp
as a single batch, but our CV runs each test suite in a separate
process so the log file won't get that big anyway)
