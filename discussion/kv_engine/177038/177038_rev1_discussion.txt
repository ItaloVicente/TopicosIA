DESCRIPTION:

MB-52067: BG Fetch always return success for no_such_key

If completeBGFetchForSingleItem returns no_such_key, consider it
unconditionally to be successful, this notifyIOComplete will always
see success allowing the front-end worker to revisit the engine and
determine how to proceed.

Note in terms of the MB triggering this fix, kv-engine generally never
needed this change because the VBucket owned bloomfilter decided if
the get would be successful, bypassing the need for a bg-fetch at all.
Now with magma as the KVStore, the VBucket owned bloomfilter isn't
enabled, hence we reach the bg-fetcher and a combination of bg-fetch
and hash-table visit are required to decide if a key exists or not.
