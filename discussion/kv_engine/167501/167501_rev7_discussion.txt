DESCRIPTION:

MB-50061: Update vBucket docCount on logical insert

Rather than update the dropped stats doc count to adjust by the
correct amount we must instead treat the first mutation in a
collection as an insert if a doc with the same key was written to
the old generation of a collection. We cannot adjust the dropped
stats count as we race with a concurrent purge of the collection.
