DESCRIPTION:

MB-30865: [2/n] Require CID encoded as leb128

Assumes that a collection enabled client will encode
a leb128 CID in index0 of the key-bytes.

* validates that the min klen is 2
* validates that something follows the leb128 data, i.e.
  the incoming packet cannot just contain 2 bytes of leb.

Line:1746, daemon/connection.cc -> I think const_char_buffer has begin() / end() methods on it which would slightly simplify the code here.

Line:58, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> Might be nice to pull this out into a helper method in unsigned_leb128.h - I expect they'll be other places where we want to check with have a valid / complete LEB128 value.

Line:93, include/mcbp/protocol/unsigned_leb128.h -> Suggest shuffling this comment up to the new maxSize constant.
