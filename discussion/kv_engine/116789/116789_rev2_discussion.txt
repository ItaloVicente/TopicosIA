DESCRIPTION:

MB-36563: Move resolvedQ to trackedWrites before getting cookies

When we transition state away from active we need to notify any
clients of in-flight SyncWrites with ambiguous. This is necessary
to not keep around connections. We do this by calling
getCookiesForInFlightSyncWrites. This drains the resolvedQueue and
throws away the items though which is a bug as we need to put them
into trackedWrites so that we can transition to PDM if appropriate.
Without the items in trackedWrites we will throw exceptions as we
cannot find the correct SyncWrite to complete.

Line:475, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Is replacing the resolvedQueue object potentially racy? What if someone tried to access the resolvedQueue while it's being destructed / constructed here?

I think it's safer to just add a reset() method to ResolvedQueue which can set the highEnqueuedSeqno to zero.
