DESCRIPTION:

MB-46750 Do blind write for initial disk snapshot

To maintain item counts, a KVStore does a lookup on every write to know
whether a write is an update or insert. This lookup can be avoided in a
DCP backfill scenario when a vbucket is being streamed right from the
start (seqno 0). Since the disk snapshot won't have any duplicates, a
lookup on the consumer side isn't required and we can safely do blind
writes i.e. writes without lookups while maintaining item counts. This
scenario commonly occurs during rebalance.

LSMs like Magma benefit from this optimisation as it can now do writes
without reads while still maintaining item count. On showfast HIDD 250M
rebalance out test, this improves performance by 22%, with rebalance
time going from 16.5mins (0.0.0-2265) to 12.8mins.

A new Magma stat called NInserts is also exposed via ep stats to measure
the number of blind writes issued.

I've added tests that Ben had suggested. If there's any more we'd like to have, let me know.

Line:48, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> Not sure of the name (but these things are hard to capture) - blind to me would mean doing something without information. A normal insert with more matches blind as you have to read before you can write - here you're doing the opposite, you have information the key doesn't exist to avoid a read.

A GuidedWrite?

Line:48, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> Or just a name that more captures what the effect is

"WriteWithoutRead" 

"NoRead" "SkipRead"

Line:896, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Whitespace-only change - please revert.

Line:454, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> This probably warrants a comment explaining the rationale here.

Line:48, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> Indeed. 

One thing to consider - I don't think this is really a Yes/No (True/False) kind of type - it's more like Insert vs Upset; given we have prior knowledge that it _must_ not previously exist.

Line:37, engines/ep/src/vb_commit.h -> Please document the new argument. (I know the existing args are not documented but please at least document the new one.

Line:7218, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Not clear why this test is being changed; could you explain please?

Line:861, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_reflection_test.cc -> Is DCPLoopbackStreamTest the correct fixture here? The optimisation is solely related to replica (Consumer) behaviour as I understand it, so this is probably better in a DCPConsumer test.

Line:48, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> Sure I'd be happy to change it. How about we name the type:

  WriteOperation { Insert, Upsert } ?

I picked BlindWrite since it is a common term in LSM theory, where writes are done without lookup.

> you have information the key doesn't exist to avoid a read
> given we have prior knowledge that it _must_ not previously exist

In the current scenario, yes this is a requirement - we must know the key does not already exist to safely issue Inserts. In a future scope, Inserts could also be used if we start supporting relaxed item counts as a feature, where we get accurate count only after a full compaction.

Line:7218, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> We stream a create and a delete of a key in the same snapshot, which isn't allowed. We should send the delete in a new snapshot. Blind writes uncovered this, since it doesn't do a lookup, the final item count stays at 2 instead of 1.

  dcp->mutation 0 (item count 1)
  dcp->mutation 1 (item count 2)
  dcp->deletion 0 (item count stays at 2 since the delete isn't matched with an existing key)

I'll add the context in the commit message.

Line:861, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_reflection_test.cc -> Sure I could move them. Would SingleThreadedPassiveStreamTest be the right place? 

I chose loopback as per Ben's suggestion. He wanted these tests to be generic DCP backfill tests to improve our general coverage. Link to the chat on kv-magma: https://couchbase.slack.com/archives/CF4FTNFEC/p1622548243220500

Line:48, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> WriteOperation sounds good. While "BlindWrite" might be standard terminology for LSMs, kv_engine itself is agnostic to the underlying KVStore so I don't think using LSM-specific terminology for generic concepts is suitable language here.

> In a future scope, Inserts could also be used if we start supporting relaxed item counts as a feature, where we get accurate count only after a full compaction.

That's fine - but I'd argue that BlindWrites are more of an implementation detail of _how_ Magma avoids the cost of item counting if that's disabled, which I think still means the "BlindWrite" terminology should be limited to Magma / MAgmaKVStore at most.

Line:7218, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Ack. A brief comment inline in the test is probably best, then the reader there sees why a new snapshot marker is being added.

Line:861, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_reflection_test.cc -> So certainly in the general case LoopbackStreamTest is a good fixture for things checking the end-to-end (Producer -> Consumer) flow, but given this feature only relates to the Consumer (replica) vBucket I think it's adding unnecessary complexity to test it via LoopbackStreamTest.

SingleThreadedPassiveStreamTest looks like a sensible place.

Line:861, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_reflection_test.cc -> Sure. Do we still want to test overwrites, purged writes, deletes, resurrections (generic DCP scenarios)? Or write tests for this feature?

Line:861, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_reflection_test.cc -> For this patch I would focus on tests covering this new feature.

I don't know the context of the discussions you had with Ben, certainly having more test coverage in the loopback tests is always a good thing, but they probably belong in their own patch.
