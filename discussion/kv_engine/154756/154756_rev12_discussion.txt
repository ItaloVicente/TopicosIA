DESCRIPTION:

MB-46750 Do blind write for initial disk snapshot

To maintain item counts, a KVStore does a lookup on every write to know
whether a write is an update or insert. This lookup can be avoided in a
DCP backfill scenario when a vbucket is being streamed right from the
start (seqno 0). Since the disk snapshot won't have any duplicates, a
lookup on the consumer side isn't required and we can safely do blind
writes i.e. writes without lookups while maintaining item counts. This
scenario commonly occurs during rebalance.

LSMs like Magma benefit from this optimisation as it can now do writes
without reads while still maintaining item count. On showfast HIDD 250M
rebalance out test, this improves performance by 22%, with rebalance
time going from 16.5mins (0.0.0-2265) to 12.8mins.

A new Magma stat called NInserts is also exposed via ep stats to measure
the number of blind writes issued.
