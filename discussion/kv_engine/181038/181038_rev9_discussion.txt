DESCRIPTION:

MB-53898: Reduce impact of Expiry by compaction by batching BgFetch

Problem:
In workloads that heavily utilities TTLs on documents and are in a very
low resident bucket, can cause front end reads to time out.

Cause:
This is due compaction generating a large number of bgfetches which need
to be performed before any front end bgfetches. These compaction expiry
bgfetches can get into the size of ~200K requests in some situations.

Fix:
To fix this we should batch bgfetches so that service each vbucket more
equally. Also when selecting items or the bgfetch batch we should
select bgfetches from the front end over bgfetches for expiry by
compaction.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> "utilise" ?

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> "...so that we can service each vbucket..."
            ^^^^^^

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think we have some complexity issues with the current implementation of how we get up to 1000 items to bgfetch...
Line:158, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> This is potentially racy / unnecessary - another front-end thread might be the reason why the vbucket now has pendingBGFetchItems.

I would suggest instead...

Line:286, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Do we need this new compactionItem member - is the token now sufficient?

Line:339, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> How would we not have a bucket here?

Line:346, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> This is potentially problematic as we have just made transferring ownership of the bgfetch items O(n) instead of O(1) previously - note this is true even when the number of items is below the limit.

In addition to the extra time this takes, it also means the bgFetch queue is locked for an extended period and hence front-end clients cannot add new requests to it.

I think we need to look more at the data structures in use here, and/or the approach used to copy up to 1000 items out of it...

Line:478, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Whitespace-only change - please revert.

Line:652, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> I think you can avoid the duplication in these methods - just return the original signature but check the type of the item being fetched and use that to decide which queue to add it to. 

Or, if you prefer to keep the two signatures (which /does/ avoid RTTI lookup), then just have a common helper function which does all the actual work once you've selected the queue to use.

Line:286, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> I think you can avoid the duplication in these methods - just return the original signature but check the type of the item being fetched and use that to decide which queue to add it to.

Line:392, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> Suggest documenting why there's two different queues here.

Line:94, engines/ep/src/vbucket_bgfetch_item.cc -> I believe you are modifying the input (rhs.bgfetched_list) here. That's probably ok, but it's non idiomatic and might catch out readers that the thing being added is being modified.

As such, I would avoid using 'operator+=' here and instead define a named function;  it may want to take the rhs argument as vb_bgfetch_item_ctx_t&& - i.e. move-from it.

Line:5914, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Suggest documenting why is this skipped for value-eviction.

Line:5924, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> I suggest you configure the bgfetchBatchSize value down for this test; 1000 is quite a large number and should end up resulting in the test taking a while to run (esp under Asan / UBSan etc).

Line:286, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> We're checking if we've completed another request before this on for the same key. If this has happened then the item in the hash table will have been replace by the real value instead of it being the tmp item.

I'll expand the comment to clarify this.

Line:339, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> not all of our tests set KVBucket and some of them leave it nullptr. I think we could refactor it to a ref for the master branch but seams a little intrusive for neo?
