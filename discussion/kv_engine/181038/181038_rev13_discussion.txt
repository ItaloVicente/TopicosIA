DESCRIPTION:

MB-53898: Reduce impact of Expiry by compaction by batching BgFetch

Problem:
In workloads that heavily utilise TTLs on documents and are in a very
low resident bucket, can cause front end reads to time out.

Cause:
This is due compaction generating a large number of bgfetches which need
to be performed before any front end bgfetches. These compaction expiry
bgfetches can get into the size of ~200K requests in some situations.

Fix:
To fix this we should batch bgfetches so that we can service each
vbucket more equally. Also when selecting items or the bgfetch batch
we should select bgfetches from the front end over bgfetches for expiry
by compaction.

(21 comments)
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Only reviewed up to ep_vb.cc; got a call now but here's some initial comments.
Line:168, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Nit: This isn't a percentage right now, it's a ratio. Suggest changing the config suffix to "_ratio" (we have more "ratio" config params than "percentage" currently).

Line:95, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> Why "btFetch" - should this be "bgFetch" ?

Line:97, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> Note this change (passing an item at a time to completeBGFetchMulti instead of converting to vector and passing entire vector) seems independent to the core batching change.

Given the patch is already pretty big, suggest splitting this change into its own patch.

Line:101, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> Shouldn't btFetchMutltiSize always be greater than zero? i.e. if it was zero that implies zero items were fetched?

Line:152, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> Are we missing a call to wakeUpTaskIfSnoozed() here (see above at lines 141-142)?

Line:98, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> This is likely to be slow / introduce contention - calling any methods on Configuration require taking a single mutex, and then searching an (ordered) map to find the value - see Configuration::getParameter().

This is essentially why we have individual classes in ep-engine cache the current value of config parameters, and use Listeners to update those caches if/when the config value changes.

Line:295, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> "is has been performed" doesn't make sense to me...

Line:298, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Why do we need to check two different CAS / token values? This function appears to be specific to compaction (completeCompactionExpiryBgFetch), so I would have assumed we could set a single "token" value.

Line:357, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> It appears this is counting how many clients (front-end connections) have requested this single key. Do we actually care about how many different people have asked for a key?

We only lookup each key from disk once (and then callback once per client); so if we are limiting how many bg fetches we perform, I think it's fine to request say 1000 *documents* in a single run, even if each document has been bgfetched by say two clients?

Line:363, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Currently we are performing two searches of lhs, in the case that the given item does not exist in lhs - once in the find() call at line 358, and again at line 359 where operator[] has to locate a place to put the item.

I think you can reduce this to one search by using try_emplace[1] to insert an empty element for the given key; if the element already exists then the iterator to it is returned and you can use that directly to call merge() with.

[1]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map/try_emplace

Line:371, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Similar to previous comment, this is going to be costly if you're calling getBffetchBatchSize() on every call to this function.

Suggest caching the batch size in this class, and adding a listener to update it when it changes.

Line:375, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Consistency: Sometimes these are referring to as "compaction" fetches, otherwise "backend" - suggest sticking with one term (compaction IMHO is more explicit so I'd use that).

Line:387, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> This could be a negative quantity (if more items were in queue chunk than maxItems - say if the configuration variable was changed to a lower number after the items already existed in the queue chunk).

As such, suggest changing the calculation to use a signed quantity (ssize_t ?) and skipping the moveRequests for compaction fetches if result is <= 0.

Line:391, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> This feels like an optimisation which should be in moveRequests() itself.

Line:399, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Style: I feel it might be clearer if you restructured this and removed a bunch of the conditional checks on what was in each frontend / compaction queue; and just tried anyway - given we always want to fetch front-end if exists, then fill up any leftover capacity with backend. 

For example:

 vb_bgfetch_queue_t itemsToFetch;
 bool itemsRemaining;
 
 if (!frontEnd->empty()) {
     itemsToFetch = frontEnd->pop();
     itemsRemaining = !frontEnd->empty();
 }
 if (itemsToFetch.size() < maxItems) {
     // do the logic to move up to maxItems to itemsToFetch from compaction queue...
     itemsRemaining |= !backEnd->empty();
 }
 
 return {itemsToFetch, itemsRemaining};

Line:395, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> Please document this class.

Line:418, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> Q: What is the behaviour if the queue is empty?

Line:428, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> Why do we need this (as a non-const method)? It somewhat breaks the encapsulation of the queue - a user could add more items to the batch than are permitted for example.

Line:463, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> Style: "src" & "dest", or "input" / "output" or similar are probably clearer than "lhs" and "rhs" - more closely matches the names in STL for moving items (e.g. https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/move).

Line:465, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> Nit: "limit" might be a better name - "num" implies that number will always be moved, which isn't the case if the source has fewer items in it.

Line:101, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> Indeed it would mean no items are fetched but technically it's a valid path as doFetch() can be called with no items to fetch.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:98, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> While revision 15 has addressed the performance problem I was trying to highlight, it makes the use of the class very tightly-coupled with ep-engine / something which must pass a callback for something which changes rarely (if ever) - i.e. the max batch size of the queue.

I would suggest a simpler / more consistent approach - just give BatchBgFetchQueue ctor a simple size_t of the batch size to use; plus a mutator which allows it to be changed (probably only when the next item is attempted to be inserted).

Deal with dynamic limit changes in the same way as other vBucket-level config params - via VBucketConfigChangeListener which can iterate all vbs in the map and directly update their size.

This gives you something with minimal overhead and simplest code in the common case (limit isn't changed).

Line:363, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Think try_emplace will cause is to perform more allocations than necessary as we'll be copying data instead of just moving it will extract and insert. Though the point of keeping around the find's itr does still make sense
