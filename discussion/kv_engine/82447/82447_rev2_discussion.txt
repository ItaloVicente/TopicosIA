DESCRIPTION:

MB-25733: ewouldblock_engine: Remove disconnected connections from map

The ewouldblock_engine maintains a per-connection "inject" record, to
specify what errors (if any) should be injected for a given client
connection.

The connection_map which manages these is keyed on the address of the
Connection object (the cookie).  In long-running tests where
connections are created, disconnected and re-created, it is possible
that a cookie may be re-used. Given that ewouldblock_engine never
removes elements from the connection map, this can result in a
connection which re-uses the same address in memory having errors
injected into it unexpected, if that address is the same as a previous
connection.

The effect of this is one can see spurious failures in tests using
ewouldblock_engine.

Solve by having EWB_Engine register an ON_DISCONNECT callback with the
server, and using that to remove connections from the map when they
are disconnected.
