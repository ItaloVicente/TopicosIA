DESCRIPTION:

MB-30302: Update bespoke loggers in EP Engine to use BucketLogger

Update the code that uses bespoke instances of the old Logger
to the new BucketLogger. This includes Couch-KVStore, DCP,
KVStore, and RocksDB-KVStore.

Add BucketLogger functionality to prepend given prefix messages
and ids to logs messages.

Create MockBucketLogger for kvstore_test

Not 100% about the approach on this, but didn't want to create a new spdlogger for each message logged after a connection dies (see the old log messages at the end of the active, notifier, and passive stream files). 

Couple notes, .c_str() calls in these changes are required, as strings cannot be passed through variadic templates. Removed incorrect %.*s conversions to {}*s which would make log calls have incorrect number of params.

(18 comments)

General approach looks good - big simplification of the logging. However, this patch has got pretty large and wide in scope.

Consider splitting this patch into two (or more) sub-patches - one which introduces the new functionality in the bucket logger; and then subsequent patches which switch over to using that for chunks of the areas in the code - ConnHandler; Couchstore, etc.

Some more specific comments below:
Line:76, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.cc -> This seems like an overly-complex API - given the prefix is an arbitrary string; why not just have the caller just specify the complex prefix ("ID : name") they want to use?

Line:88, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.cc -> Can you check the ordering of this - I think we currently have the bucket name in front of everything.

Line:119, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.cc -> I suggest you re-strucuture this - this class shouldn't be mangaging multiple "global" objects (one is "ok" but even then not ideal).

For example, if the ActiveStream class needs a global (static) logger; than have /it/ own that logger; and initialise it on the first creation of an ActiveStream object - similarly for Notifier / Passive Streams.

Line:46, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> I'd probably drop this sentence - while it might reflect the current usage, given this is a generic helper class; documenting the current usage is only likely to become outdated as other callers use it / existing usage changes.

(Your IDE can generally tell you all the places which call a method / constructor.)

Line:47, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> Prefer to use a plain std::string here; and then move it into the prefix member variable. That way we don't have to pay for a copy of the string if it's an rvalue.

Also consider if we have a simpler API by removing this constructor; and just exposing a setPrefix() method.

Line:49, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> Nit: This line is redundant.

Line:55, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> Style: List constructors in order; with default first.

Line:61, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> Abstraction is a bit unclean here - why is this public?

If it should be, public members should be listed after methods.

Line:39, engines/ep/src/connhandler.cc -> Much terser to use `bucketLogger.warn()` instead.

Line:233, engines/ep/src/connhandler.cc -> The caller probably doesn't care that much about the type of the logger - suggest you just change the implementation of the existing `getLogger()` method to return a BucketLogger; and update callers as appropriate.

Line:201, engines/ep/src/connhandler.h -> Would be nice to remove all the old usages as part of the same change; so we don't have the complexity of two types of logging at the same time.

Line:276, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Here and elsewhere - we can just change to use bucketLogger directly; and have it manage the prefix.

Line:20, engines/ep/src/dcp/notifier_stream.h -> The notifier stream class shouldn't need to include the active stream header (we try to minimise as much as possible how many headers are included - especially from .h files as that bloats the build time).

See how you can restructure this to avoid the need for this.

Line:129, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> Style (here and elsewhere, but only just spotted it here) - this is a good place to use `auto` to simplify the code (given the type is implied by the RHS):

 auto logLevel = spdlog::level::level_enum::info;

You could also consider a `using namespace spdlog::level::level_enum` or similar in the .cc files to simplify the code.

Line:19, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.h -> Similary here - the header shouldn't need to know about the consumer class.

Line:4046, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Note `stat_key` isn't guaranteed to be null-terminated; so you need to do something like construct a const_char_buffer; or in fact use the `statKey` which is assigned a couple of lines below.

Line:139, engines/ep/src/executorthread.cc -> This is a std::string so you can remove .data()

Line:22, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> Again, you don't need this header. prefer a forward declaration here.

Line:76, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.cc -> Current order is ID, Engine name, Prefix so would be more complicated to split these for printing

Line:88, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.cc -> Checked ordering, we currently do ID - Engine - Prefix so corrected to this

Line:119, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.cc -> Done

Line:46, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> Done

Line:47, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> Done. Removed and made call setPrefix

DCP BucketLogger changes - http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/97271/
