DESCRIPTION:

MB-52311: [2/n] Pause / Resume Bucket: BucketManager support

Implement pause & resume commands in BucketManager.

Commands are implemented as far as the EngineIface, whose default
implementation is to return 'not_supported'. Specific engine
implemenations behave as follows:

* Default engine 'supports' pause & resume - insofar as it returns
  'success' as it has no on-disk state.

* EWouldBlock engine passes the call down to the underlying engine.

* ep-engine for now has a stub implementation which returns 'success'
  - this will be filled in in subsequent patches.
