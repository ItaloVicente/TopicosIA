DESCRIPTION:

MB-52311: [2/n] Pause / Resume Bucket: BucketManager & ep-engine

Implement pause & resume commands in BucketManager, and for
ep-engine.

ep-engine notifies the KVStoreIface of pause / resume(), but KVStore
support is not yet implemented - see next patch in sequence.

Change-Id: I53f491a21f5a1e701bafd16ea7b3dd54ab5f786c

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> It would be a cleaner patch if you moved all of the ep-engine related stuff into the next patch which implements the pause feature in ep-engine. As the patch stands now it implements the right logic in the core _and_ adds some partial hooks into ep-engine (but not everything).
Line:569, daemon/memcached.cc -> Not related to this, but we should probably consider changing this to Debug as it is quite noisy...
