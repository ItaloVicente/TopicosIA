DESCRIPTION:

MB-52311: [2/n] Pause / Unpause Bucket: quiesce disk

WIP: Basic wiring of pause & unpause commands down into each
KVStore. Magma should be complete, Couchstore needs to wait on
compaction completing.

TODO:

1. Currently Pause / Unpause do not wait for in-flight commands to
complete; this should probably be done by using a similar approach to
DeleteBucket.

2. Pause / Unpause do not "play nice" with Bucket Delete - i.e. a
   Bucket Delete request occuring while the bucket is in the Pausing
   state (not yet Paused) is probably not going to work correctly.

3. Expand testcases - the memcached_testapp test only runs for
   couchstore (IIRC), which isn't the intended backend. We probably
   want serverless_testapp variants - however I didn't initially do
   that as we don't in general care about having a full cluster for
   this test (it can work fine single-node).
