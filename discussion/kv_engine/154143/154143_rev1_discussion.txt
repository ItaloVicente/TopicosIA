Line:363, include/statistics/stats.def.h -> I think we should either keep both or none of bg_wait and bg_load - they go hand-in-hand and only having one is of limited value.

Line:365, include/statistics/stats.def.h -> Not sure access_scanner is much use (esp given the other ones we have removed...)
