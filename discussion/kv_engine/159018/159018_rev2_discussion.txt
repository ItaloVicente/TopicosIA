DESCRIPTION:

MB-47009: When resuming a filtered snapshot, check we reach the end

In the MB a stream is resumed, but has a snapshot end greater than the
start-seqno, if the mutations in the range start to snap-end are
filtered away the stream remains dormant and the client assumes the
end has yet to be reached.

We now check for this situation when generating a memory snapshot and
ensures snapshot+seqno advance gets the client to the snap-end seqno.

Line:1288, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> wrong comment - i mean sync-write/repl enabled. I've a follow-on patch to disable filter + sync-write as it has 0 testing and i'm sure doesn't work because you still need seqno advance if a snapshot ends on another collection
