DESCRIPTION:

MB-50110: Reset CheckpointMemRecoveryTask to SNOOZED only at return

Currently the task is set to SNOOZED at function's prologue.
The consequence is that the task runs in that state, and any further
attempt of waking up the task would be successful even when the task is
already running.
That caused unnecessary over-scheduling. Issue introduced at
https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/165623.
