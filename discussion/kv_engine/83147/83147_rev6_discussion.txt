DESCRIPTION:

MB-25884: Audit and remove, where possible, uses of array new[]

Replace several dynamic arrays with safer hadlers, such
as std::vector, std::string or std::unique_ptr. These prevent
memory leaks caused by array resources not being freed up, and
conform to Couchbase's and C++'s best practices.

Change generally looks very good - lots of nice cleanup here :)

Few smallish comments - let me know if you have any questions.
Line:57, daemon/memcached_openssl.cc -> Prefer using std::make_unique<> instead of new - it ultimately does the same thing, but has a few benefits - see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rh-make_unique

Note(2): I believe you can use a std::vector here; which has the advantage of "knowing" how large it is. A test on godbolt[1] suggest that should work.

Line:35, engines/ep/src/ext_meta_parser.cc -> Might as well revert this also given it's only a whitespace change now.

Line:26, engines/ep/src/ext_meta_parser.h -> Don't believe you need this header anymore.

Line:295, engines/ep/src/failover-table.cc -> I think this code has changed recently (Dan modified it) - so you probably want to rebase and resolve any conflicts.

Line:629, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Style: Please leave these with the same whitespace as they had.

I know this isn't the "correct" current format (and it may well have been clang-format which automatically reformatted the whole paragraph), but by changing the whitespace here you change the "last modified" patch for these lines, making it harder to use things like `git blame` etc to see when the code was "really" last changed.
