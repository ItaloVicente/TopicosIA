DESCRIPTION:

ExecutorPool: Allow snooze() to be asynchronous

ExecutorPool::snooze() currently returns a bool if the task was
found. However for FollyExecutorPool this requires using a blocking
(runInEventBaseThreadAndWait) call, which forces waking thread to be
blocked until the IO thread has woken, updated the wake time and
context-switched back to initial calling thread. Profiling shows this
blocking & context switching is significant.

The vast majority of callers of snooze() don't care about if the task
was found (and sleep time modified) - note that even _if_ they do
check the result, there's still no guarantee the task will actually
sleep for that particular duration, given it still could be cancelled
before then.

As such, modify snooze() to return void, avoiding the aforementioned
costs in FollyExecutorPool. For the limited number of use-cases which
do check the result, introduce a snoozeAndWait() synchronous call which
is equivalent to the old snooze().

Results from mancouch for LongLivedScheduleRun tests (which snooze()
and wake() repeatedly) - note items_per_second, particulary at higher
thread counts have increased from 160,000 "items" (Task wake /
snoozes) per second to 200,000:
