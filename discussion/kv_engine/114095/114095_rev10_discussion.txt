DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Change calls to SyncCommitBatches to use config param

SyncCommitBatches is used to persist any pending batches of items to the
WAL. In addition, it can also create a commit point when configuration
calls for creating a commit point on every batch flush. This checkin is
to make all calls to SyncCommitBatch use the configuration setting.

This issue was exposed during testing when it was observed that
kv_engine is calling snapshotVBucket quite frequently, especially in low
DGM scenarios forcing the write cache out and thus creating tiny
sstables which increased compaction frequency.
