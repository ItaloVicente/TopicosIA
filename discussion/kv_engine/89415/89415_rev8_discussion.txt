DESCRIPTION:

MB-26021 [4/6]: Refactor - simplify CheckpointManager::getAllItemsForCursor

CheckpointManager::getAllItemsForCursor unecessarily attempts to
advance the cursor to the next checkpoint if we are positioned at the
end of a checkpoint - this is already handled by incrCursor() which is
called just above.

Remove the unnecessary code, and expand the Checkpoint test cases to
verify the behaviour is correct.
