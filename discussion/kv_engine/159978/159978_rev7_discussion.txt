DESCRIPTION:

MB-48120: Make magma metadata usable in non-kv projects

Currently magma MetaData includes Item and a couple of other
kv types that we won't want to include in non-kv projects(magma)
when we re-use the metadata.

In addition, move the metadata files to a new directory that,
for want of a better name, is called "shared" so that in a future
patch we can compile the metadata in a separate library that magma
can link against.

Magma also wants the Metadata type to be convertible to and from
nlohmann json so add functions to do so.
