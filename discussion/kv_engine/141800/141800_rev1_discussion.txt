DESCRIPTION:

MB-43015: Don;t acquire Configuration mutex in decodeWithMetaOptions()

EventuallyPersistentEngine::decodeWithMetaOptions() accesses the
conflict resolutoin mode via the Configuration, which is slow as
Configuration is actually implemented as a map requiring a lock to
access.

When measuring XDCR initial replication throughput at the destination
(i.e. SET_WITH_META throughput), approx 5% of worker thread runtime is
in configuration.getConflictResolutionType().

Avoid this by adding a conflictResolutionMode member variable to
EPEngine and using that instead.
