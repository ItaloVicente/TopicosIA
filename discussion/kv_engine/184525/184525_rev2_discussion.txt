DESCRIPTION:

Move withLabels to base StatCollector

withLabels allows construction of a new collector which will add the
provided labels to every subsequent addStat call:

 StatCollector c = ...;
 auto labelled = c.withLabels({{"foo", "bar"}});
 labelled.addStat(Key::something, value);
 labelled.addStat(Key::something_else, otherValue);

However, this was previously only defined on LabelledStatCollector
itself, so was only usable on Bucket/Scope/CollectionStatCollectors.

That's an unnecessary restriction; indeed, prior to
https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/137974
withLabels was available on StatCollector.

Restore StatCollector::withLabels.
