DESCRIPTION:

MB-45757: Make CM::removeCursor resilient to invalid cursors

In CheckpointManager::removeCursor we check that the cursor being
removed is be valid. If we find ourselves removing an invalid cursor
then we throw and crash.

But, the current CheckpointCursor concurrency model allows legal (and
safe) conditions where we may try to invalidate/remove a DCP cursor
twice, so the fix is to just do nothing and return the call in that
case.
