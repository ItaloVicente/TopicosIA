DESCRIPTION:

MB-36794 Ensure we disconnect when we receive EINVAL

Ensure we disconnect as an producer when we receive EINVAL for DCP
{prepare, commit, abort} from the consumer. As currently we just we
just swallow these errors, which can cause our connection to deadlock.
As we may have thought we've sent all the data the consumer need but
in fact its view of the world is now logically incorrect. Thus,
disconnecting gives us an opportunity to re-connect and resolve this bad
state.

Also add a unit test to check that we return false in the correct
situations from DcpProducer::handleResponse(). Also fix a couple of
clang tidy warnings.
