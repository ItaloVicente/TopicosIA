DESCRIPTION:

MB-27533: Include CPU time in results from benchmark tests

In future, code changes might appear to preform the same in real time,
but may infact be taking more CPU time - so whilst this isn't
necessarily a performance regression it does highlight that the code may
be sub-optimal or has introduced additional complexity.
