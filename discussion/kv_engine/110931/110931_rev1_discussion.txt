DESCRIPTION:

MB-34314: Move RollbackResult to new file

RollbackResult should also logically contain the prepares that we need
to re-add to the PassiveDM. This requires it to own a container of
queued_items which requires it to have the full definition of an Item.
Move RollbackResult to a new file so that we do not have a circular
reference between ep_types.h and item.h (via storeddockey.h) and do not
have to include item.h in everything including ep_types.h.
