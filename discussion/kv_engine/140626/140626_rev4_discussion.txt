DESCRIPTION:

MB-42780: Make replica resilient to missing MARKER_FLAG_CHK

Since 6.5.0 the Active ensures that Disk snapshots are never merged into
an existing checkpoint. That is achieve by setting the MARKER_FLAG_CHK
in the SnapshotMarker sent to Replica.

That all works fine until Active behaves as expected.
In pre-6.5.0 we had issues where Active couls miss the MARKER_FLAG_CHK
in markers. In the 6.0.1->6.6.1 upgrade scenario seen in MB-42780, one
of the effect is replica failure (with consequent rebalance/upgrade
failure).

With this patch, replica enforces the same logic that we had already
added at active in 6.5.0. That makes replica resilient to any DCP
Producer that misses to set the MARKER_FLAG_CHK properly.

Line:1005, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> I've no idea why this comment is here - this is the general code path for when we receive a marker in a steady-state in-memory stream, so not sure why this comment about "reconnecting"
I see that you added this comment, I can update with an updated/corrected version if you like to provide it. I ll leave the comment as it is otherwise

Line:3746, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Actually (as per my latest update in the MB) the Disk->Disk transition doesn't suffer the issue that we are fixing here. So quick answer is no.
Obviously I'm happy to expand tests. I have already identified a couple of variations of this test that I would like to put in. But those are all about coverage, they are all successful scenarios that I ve considered to add in a follow-up/test-only patch for not delaying/blocking this fix. Same story about "reverting" MB-41283 (original fix for Memory->Disk transition).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:3746, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Sure, but even in that case the failure would be a QueueDirtyStatus::FailureDuplicateItem (if verified).
I'm pretty sure that this fix will prevent a number of collateral/unexpected issues. What you describe (which is what we discussed offline) may be one of those, but not what we fix here.

Line:3746, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> > Disk->Disk doesn't suffer the same situation on the original replica, but it could propagate the error to a new replica if it streams a merged Disk checkpoint (as a Disk snapshot)

But that is not propagating the same error. Here we are fixing "Key not found in KeyIndex". While what you describe is a possible "QueueDirtyStatus::FailureDuplicateItem".
Note that it is only a *possible* failure. It must be verified if that's the case. In my latest code inspection on that, I see that actually we probably don't fail at all as deduplication doesn't trigger at all for Disk checkpoints (keyIndex empty).

Personally would add the test here as your fix also fixes that if there's time to do so

+1 to test if we have time, if not it can go in as a follow-up patch.

Line:3746, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Well that depends on what node we stream to. It's not impossible for us to do 6.0.X -> 6.6.X -> 6.5.X and 6.5.X has disk checkpoint indexes and I believe that would throw.
