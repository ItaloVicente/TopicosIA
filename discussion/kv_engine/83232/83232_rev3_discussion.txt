DESCRIPTION:

MB-25960: Remove temporary deleted/non-existent items

We store temporary deleted/non-existent items in the hash table
so that a subsequent call can find out if a particular item has
been deleted or doesn't exist. But, once the call is completed,
those items unnecessarily occupy space. Hence, remove those items
once the purpose is served
