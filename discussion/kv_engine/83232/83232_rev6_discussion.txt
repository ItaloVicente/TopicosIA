DESCRIPTION:

MB-25960: Remove temporary deleted/non-existent items

We store temporary deleted/non-existent items in the hash table
so that a subsequent call can find out if a particular item has
been deleted or doesn't exist. But, once the call is completed,
those items unnecessarily occupy space. Hence, remove those items
once the purpose is served

We should also expand the testcases for the methods which previously left temporary items in the HashTable to check they have now removed them.
Line:1955, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I think given this modifies the HashTable (removing the item) we need give this function a different name (which makes it explicit that is cleans up any deleted items), as the current name doesn't suggest it actually modifies anything.

Line:1045, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Nit: Maybe make this more explicit and say "deleted (normal or temporary)", just to make it 100% clear we are counting both types?

Line:1053, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> I think this can also be made const.
