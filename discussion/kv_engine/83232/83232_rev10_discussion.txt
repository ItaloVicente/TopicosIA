DESCRIPTION:

MB-25960: Remove temporary deleted/non-existent items

We store temporary deleted/non-existent items in the hash table
so that a subsequent call can find out if a particular item has
been deleted or doesn't exist. But, once the call is completed,
those items unnecessarily occupy space. Hence, remove those items
once the purpose is served

I'm still not sure this is the clearest way to write this code. While I understand the idea to cleanup the temporary item as part of checking for it (to guarantee we don't forget to do it), I think the readability / clarity of the code suffers. To the reader of this code it's not clear what the meaning of the return value is.

Additionally, I don't think we want to remove (non-temporary) deleted items - given they now can have a valid body, users may want to read them multiple times and hence we shouldn't immediately delete them from the hashTable.

Although it's more verbose, I think it might be better to split this into two different functions - maybe something like:

 if (v->isLogicallyNonExistent()) {
      ht.cleanupIfTemporaryItem(v);
      return ENOENT;
 }

I think this is clearer to the reader what is going on - admittedly it still has the possibility that someone forgets to cleanup the temporary item (if ht.cleanupIfTemporaryItem is omitted), but I think that's a reasonable tradeoff.

Note that `isLogicallyNonExistent()` would return true in the three cases (delete, tempDeleted or tempNonExistent), but `cleanupIfTemporaryItem()` would only remove tempDelete / tempNonExistent from the HT.

Thoughts / comments?
Line:761, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> I would have thought we still want to run this for ephemeral; it won't need to handle tempDeleted but the code should still work.

Line:802, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> I don't understand why unlockKey() is being called here - where it the document locked earlier?

Line:835, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> I think this (and the following validateKey fas) should be moved into their own testcase (this one is getting pretty long).

Line:761, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> If it can't handle the tempDeleted item, then I am not too sure about what we are accomplishing but running this test for the ephemeral case.

Line:761, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> isDeleted is a valid state for ephemeral; so I thought there would be some value in testing that case.
