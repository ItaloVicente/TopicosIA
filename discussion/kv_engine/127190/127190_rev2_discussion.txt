DESCRIPTION:

MB-38845: Do not update stats at flush-failure for VBs set for deletion

For some reason, we used to update some flush stats in
PersistenceCallback::redirty(), which is wrong as that function is
executed in the code path for flush-failure.
That may cause underflow in some stats. In particular
VBucket::dirtyQueueSize is a NonNegativeCounter and may throw in
dev-builds.
