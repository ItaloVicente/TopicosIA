DESCRIPTION:

MB-48399: Move data directory creation to engine init

ns_server only create the process level data directory, not the bucket
level data directory, which they expect us to create. Move the code
from the KVStores to engine init so that:

a) it's more explicit that we create the directory (not hidden away)
b) it's in one common place for all bucket types
c) we can assert that it exists in a future change in which we try to
   save shard counts for magma buckets
