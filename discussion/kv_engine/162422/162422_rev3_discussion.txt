Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Based on the comments fro Jim in yesterday's standup; it sounds like our KVStores (Couchstore at least) _do_ create the data directory if it doesn't exist.

This might have been done as a convenience to make unit tests etc easier, but I think that _if_ ns_server doesn't necessarily create the data dir then we should probably do it in the KVStore.

Aka I think we should have a clean separation of responsibility as to who creates / and who deletes the data dir between ns_server and kv_engine; and we shouldn't have both of them potentially doing it as that just leads to issues of responsibility.

Can you check what exact ns_server behaviour is (and what Couchstore and Magma currently do) - if you haven't already - before proceeding with this. If ns_server does always create the data dir I suggest we modify CouchKVStore (and others?) to _not_ create it automatically.

Done by ns_server at server startup - http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/ns_server/couchbase-server.sh.in#193-195. Moved the code from KVStores to tests
