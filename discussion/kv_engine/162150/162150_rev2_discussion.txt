DESCRIPTION:

MB-48506: Use move-semantic on expelled container at ItemExpel

The expelled container is constructed under CM::queueLock and then
copied back to the caller for lock-free destruction.
That copy is executed under CM::queueLock and it's O(N = toWrite-size),
so replace that with a O(1) move.
