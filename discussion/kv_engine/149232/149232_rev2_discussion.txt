DESCRIPTION:

MB-45132: 2/n use a single loop when processing collection stats

Remove the separate read and process loops for the processing of
the collection stats. With loops removed the temporary map which
can also be removed, which could become large (1000+) if the
collection config was maxxed out.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

The original reason for splitting out the the loops was so that we would be in a constant state if we failed to read a collection from disk we wouldn't have tried to modify anything before we had got hold of all stats. Otherwise we could end up in the state where half the collections stats have been updated and the other half not?

In both the loops no writeback occurs, we are populating the localDocQueue with pending data - if the loop fails, nothing in the localDocQueue gets written.
