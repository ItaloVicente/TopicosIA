Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think we can probably be more aggressive here - given we are only logging changed connections, I think changing the frequency of step 2 to say 30s should be fine (assuming we print nothing at all if nothing has changed).

Line:1907, daemon/memcached.cc -> Might be worth adding a comment about what's going on here, and/or pulling all of this into a helper function so the normal path (no slow connections hanging around) is easier to see.

Line:1958, daemon/memcached.cc -> I think the lohnmann::json class supports equality operators itself, so you don't need to serialise to a string to compare them.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:1907, daemon/memcached.cc -> Done

Line:1958, daemon/memcached.cc -> It didn't compile when I tried to use "==" in there, but I got a compile error so I didn't bother... This code is run in a dedicated thread (now) every 30 sec and there shouldn't be that many entries in there so I didn't spend too much time trying to figure out how nlohmann worked ;)
