DESCRIPTION:

MB-35331: Update vbucket_state from the flusher items only

In MB-35331 we see a test fail because a vbucket state change appears
to be lost. This occurs because two set_vbucket_state operations occur
in quick succession. The first state transition also happens to allow
the flusher to run (because of changes in 96baa3b3 that open a new
checkpoint). The flusher runs and reads the vbucket's state and
happens to update the KVStore cache with the new vbucket state. The
real set_vbucket_state transition is later flushed and now has no
affect because the cache says that no state change occured.

This is just one problem that occurs because flushVBucket reads state
from the VBucket object and reacts to it. This is now changed so that
flushVBucket only reacts to data that it can derive from the flusher
batch, fixing the MB and many other potential 'race' conditions.

The majority of the persisted vbucket state is already derived from
the item's of the flushed batch, only the state, failover table and
replication topology were read from vbucket state. This commit now
"serialises" these bits of VBucket state into a JSON document during
a vbucket state change (with the state change lock held), the JSON
document becomes the value of the queued set_vbucket_state Item
allowing the flusher to derive the persisted state from the Item
value and not from current VBucket state.

The following lists each vbucket_state field and describes its source.

* highSeqno and purgeSeqno were not stored by the vbstate document,
  couch-kvstore removes these fields during CouchKVStore::saveVBState.
* state, replicationTopology and failover table are updated only when
  the flusher encounters a set_vbucket_state Item, the value of the
  Item stores a JSON document containing the values for these fields. A
  new structure called vbucket_transition_state owns these fields.
* maxDeletedSeqno - no change, this field was always set from item's
  of the flushed batch.
* lastSnapStart, lastSnapEnd - no change, these fields were always set
  from the checkpoint(s) that the flushed batch is derived from.
* maxCas - no change, always derived by scanning the item's of the flush
* hlcCasEpochSeqno - no change, this field was always set a seqno of
  the flushed batch.
* mightContainXattrs - this now set during the flush, if an xattr item
  is flushed, this field is set (and stays set forever).
* supportNamespaces - no change, this is never anything other than true
* version - no change, this is a constant value
* highCompletedSeqno and highPreparedSeqno - no change, derived by
  scanning the item's of the flushed batch
* onDiskPrepares - this is set by the flusher from the items, but is
  actually set by CouchKVStore::saveDocs
