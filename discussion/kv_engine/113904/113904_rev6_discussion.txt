DESCRIPTION:

MB-35331: Update vbucket_state from the flusher items only

In MB-35331 we see a test fail because a vbucket state transition
appears to be lost. The cause of this issue first begins with two
set_vbucket_state requests occurring in quick succession. The replica to
active transition also happens to allow the flusher to run (this is a
behaviour change due to commit 96baa3b3 where a new checkpoint is
opened). If the timing of the flusher running happens to mean that the
checkpoint is empty (only a checkpoint_start) the flusher still cycles
through and happens to read the VBucket's state (which has been updated
by the set_vbucket_state requests), the value read now happens to be
pushed to the KVStore cache only (it is not committed because the
flusher logic says it should not be). Next the flusher will run again,
and this time a set_vb_state operation is found, again the VBucket's
state is read and the flusher proceeds to commit updated state to disk,
however because the KVStore cache has already been changed to include
the new state, the commit is skipped. Hence we lose the state change.

This is just one problem that occurs because flushVBucket reads state
from the VBucket object and reacts to it. In this commit the flusher is
changed so that all data that flushVBucket reacts too is data derived
from the items to flush. This fixes the specific MB issue and other
potential 'race' conditions.

Notes:

The majority of the persisted vbucket data is already derived from the
item's of the flushed batch, only the state, fail-over table and
replication topology were read from VBucket object.

This commit now "serialises" this VBucket owned data into a JSON
document during the processing of the set_vbucket_state request (with
the VBucket lock held). The JSON document is written as the value of the
queued set_vbucket_state Item allowing the flusher to now read from the
flushed Item and not the VBucket.

The following lists each vbucket_state field and describes its source.

* highSeqno and purgeSeqno were not stored by the vbucket state document,
  couch-kvstore removes these fields during CouchKVStore::saveVBState.
  couchstore maintains these values in the dbinfo part of the vbucket file.
* state, replicationTopology and fail-over table are updated only when
  the flusher encounters a set_vbucket_state Item, the value of the
  Item stores a JSON document containing the values for these fields. A
  new structure called vbucket_transition_state owns these fields.
* maxDeletedSeqno - no change, this field was always set from item's
  of the flushed batch.
* lastSnapStart, lastSnapEnd - no change, these fields were always set
  from the checkpoint(s) that the flushed batch is derived from.
* maxCas - no change, always derived by scanning the item's of the flush
* hlcCasEpochSeqno - no change, this field was always set a seqno of
  the flushed batch.
* mightContainXattrs - this now set during the flush, if an xattr item
  is flushed, this field is set (and stays set forever).
* supportNamespaces - no change, this is never anything other than true
* version - no change, this is a constant value
* highCompletedSeqno and highPreparedSeqno - no change, derived by
  scanning the item's of the flushed batch
* onDiskPrepares - this is set by the flusher from the items, but is
  actually set by CouchKVStore::saveDocs
