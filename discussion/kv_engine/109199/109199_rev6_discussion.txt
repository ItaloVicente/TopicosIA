DESCRIPTION:

Use MockEphemeralVBucket in VBucketDurabilityTest

Because we don't hit the public functions in VBucketDurabilityTest
(we would need an engine to do so) we miss a call to update the
collections stats on a set. To add some SyncDelete tests in the future,
we need to be able to manually correct the collections stats for
Epehemeral to prevent counter underflow assertions.
