DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: Support flush of a ModifyCollection system event

Update the schema in kvstore.fbs to include a new bool field for storing
the collections history setting.

The KVStore derived VB::Manifest now captures the history setting from
CreateCollection events.

With that, check for the flush of a ModifyCollection event and use the
settings from that event to make any adjustments to the KVStore
collection data.

VB::Manifest now reloads the correct state from warmup and flush
support allows testing of Modify from backfill.

A limitation of this commit is that drop collection does not yet
support the ModifyCollection event (it is not dropped when it
should be).
