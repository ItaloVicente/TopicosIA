DESCRIPTION:

MB-40415: Update local documents as part of commit

Previously compaction happened over two steps; first the database
was compacted and documents purged before the local documents
(_local/vbstate and _local/collections/dropped) was updated to
reflect the changes. This results in two different database
headers being written to the file. If the system crashed before
the last database header was written to disk we would end up
with an inconsistent vbucket file as we would use the compacted
file without the local documents updated.

This patch performs the modification in a precommit hook so that
we'll compact and update the local document within the same
couchstore commit.

Also needs a unit test.
Line:1159, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Style: You don't need the explicit lambda return type in C++17 for virtually all cases (only necessary if it would be ambiguous otherwise).

Line:1241, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I can't see this being done in the new callback?

The update of the the vbstate should be unconditional (can only see us doing changes to _local/vbstate preparesPurged != 0)

It doesn't change any visible functionality so the current behavior should already be tested (the atomic part of the commit is tested as part of the couchstore test)

It's fixing a bug which could happen if a crash happened in the "wrong" place before; I think we need to demonstrate the issue otherwise we cannot prove this fixes it. 

If necessary we could add testing hooks to allow us to close a couchstore file between the normal commit and the setVBState update to expose the current issue.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1241, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> For couchstore we don't use last_sequence and purge_seq in _local/vbstate, so the only information we change _which is_ stored in the _local/vbstate it would be the onDiskPrepares (which is only changed iff preparesPurged is changed, so it might just be a "premature optimization" to skip updating it if it isn't changed...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1241, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> ah yes, mixing up commit (flusher) vs commit compaction
