DESCRIPTION:

MB-22523: Return TMFAIL once all items are evicted from memory

Once all items from memory have been evicted in memoryCondition(),
return TMPFAIL in the case of FULL_EVICTION as we should always
be able to find evict items to create memory

Change-Id: I69e2f1fb2978d547f56b5134bff7a8ed051abc5c

Line:3040, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Suggest you return the structure of this back to how it was (so we have the same logic for value eviction we've had for a while, even if it's possibly problematic), and just add an extra clause in the final `else ... return ENOMEM` section for Full eviction where you return tmpfail instead.

Line:4789, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I expect this only covers the case where you initially hit the watermark and not that metadata overhead is maxed out - given that you'll be racing with the item pager.

You might want to look at a test which disables the item pager and sees the effect that has - I suspect a single-threaded EVP test will be better suited (as you can control when the pager runs).

Line:4792, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> This is never used.

Line:4796, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Nit: trailing whitespace.

Line:7554, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> We probably don't want this, given there's both a value and full eviction variant of this suite we might as well run the test in both configurations.

Line:3040, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Done

Line:4789, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> True. This only covers that one case. I tried looking at adding a test case in item_pager_test.cc. memOverhead is the memory from allocating the structures namely, KVBucket, Checkpoint and each entry in the checkpoint. That memory is much smaller in comparison to the memory occupied by items in the hash table. So, the condition (stats.getMaxDataSize() > stats.memOverhead->load()) would be very hard to simulate in a standalone test.

Line:4789, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> In a unit test (one where you have access to an engine object) just "hack" the value of memOverhead - just increment it by a large amount.
