Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

As discussed, I'm a bit nervous of making such a dramatic change at this point in the release cycle, especially without any specific tests.

I think we should investigate fixing this in a more directed fashion based on the original MB - i.e. modifying this so in full-eviction we don't return ENOMEM (as it should always be possible to recover memory there).

Additionally, we need tests for this - either highlight existing ones or create new ones - looking at code coverage we currently have nothing testing the ENOMEM case: http://cv.jenkins.couchbase.com/view/Nightly/job/kv_engine-nightly-coverage/457/cobertura/kv_engine_engines_ep_src/ep_engine_cc/#3013

Sure. Will add more tests.
