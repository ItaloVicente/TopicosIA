DESCRIPTION:

MB-52675: Add PagingVisitor benchmark

Add a benchmark for the PagingVisitor which measures how long
it takes to "visit" a vBucket. This measures how long it takes to
page out the required amount of items (memory) from the vBucket.
The benchmarks also logs the number of evicted items.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:34, /COMMIT_MSG -> I feel like the runtime of actual "useful" work here - a few tens of milliseconds - is very small - particulary compared to the wallclock runtime.

I worry about:

(a) getting a large enough sample set - are we actually measuring the costs we see in production (cache / pagetable misses, etc).

(b) the error bar / noise on these numbers given we only run for a short period and with a fixed iteration of "1" so GoogleBench isn't going to re-run to get multiple samples.

Can we say bump the iteration count up, or remove it and let GoogleBench decide?

(Perhaps that means we want to look at reducing cost further? Could we cheat and not actually persist anything, just mark everything as clean - or maybe run in Ephemeral mode?)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:34, /COMMIT_MSG -> Got some level of iteration now on these, particularly the faster running 10MB ones. Error bar seems fine, see some variation on the longer running ones but the faster one are very stable.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:34, /COMMIT_MSG -> It is pretty low.

a) Cache misses etc may be hard to hit, but I don't think we expect to see 256MB vBuckets for the most part (all of these tests are single vBucket)

b) Error has been around 10%. I set iterations to 1 because I had issues with reproducing the same values from the test (something wasn't freeing up memory so runtimes were wildly different). Will experiment further though with that.

Ephemeral pageOut is quite different, not really comparable to EP pageOut. We could mark everything as clean, but we'd also want to remove stuff from the CM or we have that bloating memory and potentially stopping us from getting to the LWM/HWM
