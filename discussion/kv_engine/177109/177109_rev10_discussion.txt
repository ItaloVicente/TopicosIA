DESCRIPTION:

MB-52675: Add PagingVisitor benchmark

Add a benchmark for the PagingVisitor which measures how long
it takes to "visit" a vBucket. This measures how long it takes to
page out the required amount of items (memory) from the vBucket.
The benchmarks also logs the number of evicted items.
