DESCRIPTION:

Decouple vbucket.h from kv_bucket.h

kv_bucket.h is one of the most expensive headers to compile in an
'everything' build of kv_engine, second only to GTest.h:

    ** Expensive headers:
    25140 ms: tlm/deps/googletest.exploded/include/gmock/gmock.h (included 58 times, avg 433 ms), included via:
    22681 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h (included 44 times, avg 515 ms), included via:

52% of the include cost of kv_bucket.h is including the header
vbucket.h.

Restructure headers so kv_bucket.h doesn't need to include vbucket.h,
mostly by moving the types it does need into their own vbucket_types.h
header.

This makes the cost to include kv_bucket.h around half of what it
previously was.
