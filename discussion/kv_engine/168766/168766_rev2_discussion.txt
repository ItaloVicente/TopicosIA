DESCRIPTION:

MB-50400: Get _local/scope not _local/scopes

Problem:
MB-50400 observed a crash when upgrading from 7.0.0 to 7.1.0 for a
bucket that use scopes other than the default collection.

Cause:
This was caused a regression when modifying code so that it could be
used with Magma, specifically the add ding the const
LocalDocKey::openScopes, which was added with the value
"_local/scopes/open". This meant that after upgrade KVStore would look
under the wrong local key when trying to fined the vbucket's scope data.

Fix:
Change LocalDocKey::openScopes back to "_local/scope/open"
