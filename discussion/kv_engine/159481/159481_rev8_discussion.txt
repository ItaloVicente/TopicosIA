DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Don't use CM::getNumItemsForCursor in AS::nextCheckpointItem

The call is O(N = ckpt-list-size) and executes under CM lock in a hot
path (DCP frontend worker).

Note: The new logic is massively covered by unit tests, any error
produces hundreds of failures in DCP tests with DCP clients that stop
receiving items from the Producer.
