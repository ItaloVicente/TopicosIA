DESCRIPTION:

MB-44496: Support Prometheus-only metrics

Some metrics are not expected to be available via cbstats, but _are_
required to be exported for Prometheus.

Such metrics do not need a cbstats name, just a metric family, unit,
and optional labels.

Change-Id: I54ed3dc2d549128b551160ed905e83d30c7facb0
