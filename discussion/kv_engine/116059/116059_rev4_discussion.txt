DESCRIPTION:

MB-36366: Don't drop cursors if checkpoint expelling was good enough

Reviewing of the code revealed that if we're in a situation where
checkpoint memory is above the upper bound the amount of memory that
ClosedUnrefCheckpointRemoverTask::attemptMemoryRecovery is told to
reclaim is too large, the result could be that if expelling was
successful in getting checkpoint memory down to the lower bound the
function would still go on to cursor dropping.

The following shows the values used when evaluating memory recovery
and goes onto highlight the issue fixed here.

0                                                                      #
├───────────────────┬───────────────┬───────────────┬────┬────┬────┬───┤
│                   │               │               │    │    │    │   │
│                   │               │               │    │    │    │   │
└───────────────────▼───────────────▼───────────────▼────▼────▼────▼───┘
                    A               B               L    C    H    D

Using the coded defaults and the default configuration.json:

A = cursor_dropping_checkpoint_mem_lower_mark (30%)
B = cursor_dropping_checkpoint_mem_upper_mark (50%)
C = cursor_dropping_lower_mark (80%)
D = cursor_dropping_upper_mark (95%)
L = mem_low_watermark (75%)
H = mem_high_watermark (85%)

In a situation when checkpoint memory alone is larger than B we wish to
attempt to get checkpoint memory down to A or less. The same diagram
shows an example checkpoint (X) memory and mem_used (Y).

0                                                                      #
├───────────────────┬───────────────┬───┬───────────┬──┬─┬────┬────┬───┤
│                   │               │   │           │  │ │    │    │   │
│                   │               │   │           │  │ │    │    │   │
└───────────────────▼───────────────▼───▼───────────▼──▼─▼────▼────▼───┘
                    A               B   X           L  Y C    H    D

The difference between X and Y should be non checkpoint memory, ideally
the data in the cache, but could be other transient allocations. Before
this commit the target to free was calculated as Y - A, i.e. we're
including the size of the cached items in the target.

So if expelling ran and successfully moved X down to A or lower, the
ClosedUnrefCheckpointRemoverTask::attemptMemoryRecovery would see that
the target is unsatisfied and still go on to drop cursors.

This commit changes the target to be X - A, so if expelling is by itself
successful in getting X down to A or less, then the target is satisfied
and cursor dropping is not attempted.

This commit also:

1) updates attemptMemoryRecovery to read mem_used once and base all
 calculations from that data-point, this makes the function simpler to
 reason about.

2) When mem_used exceeds the cursor_dropping_upper_mark (95%) also log
 the checkpoint consumption. It could happen that we trigger expelling
 and cursor dropping, yet checkpoint consumption isn't an issue, it is
 worth logging if this ever happens.
