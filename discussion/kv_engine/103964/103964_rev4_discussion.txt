DESCRIPTION:

MB-32785: Replica acks memory-seqno at snapshot-end

Currently a Replica sends a SeqnoAck with the memory-seqno as soon as a
Prepare is received.
But, for achieving the consistency model that we aim to (consistency at
failure scenario, details in DesignDoc) the Replica cannot acknowledge
mutations in the middle of a snapshot.

With this patch, a Replica sends an aggregated SeqnoAck only when it
receives the snapshot-end mutation, and only if the snapshot contains at
least one durable write.

Line:550, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> Please add a comment explaining the purpose of this.

Line:552, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> You don't really need the compare/exchange here - you can just blindly set it to true; there should only be a single actor notifying this - and even if there isn't, you don't really care if you "double-set" the flag. In other words this is a level-triggered flag not edge triggered.

Line:826, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> Please document this (or give it a more descriptive name).

Line:216, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.h -> Please document this.
