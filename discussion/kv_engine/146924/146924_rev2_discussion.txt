DESCRIPTION:

MB-44558: HashTable: Reset all item counts on clear()

Not all members of Statistics are reset to zero on clear:

* numDeletedItems - used to calculate curr_items stat amongst others.
* numSystemItems - used to calculate curr_items stat amongst others.
* numPreparedSyncWrites - used to calculate curr_items stat amongst
                          others.
* metaDataMemory - used by ItemPager to calculate pagable memory.

Part of the reason this occurred was that the stats struct
contained members of type std::atomic, which doesn't allow
assignment. As such, the reset() method of Statistics couldn't use the
simpler implementation:

    stats = {};

but instead had to explicitly assign each to zero:

    stats.foo.store(0);
    stats.bar.store(0);
    ...

As such, this made it easy to forget to reset 'stats.baz' when it was added.

Fix by introducing a helper class - CopyableAtomic - which wraps
std::atomic but allows copying (and assignment). By changing the type
of each stat to this template type, we can use the simpler and less
error-prone method to reset.

Line:46, engines/ep/src/copyable_atomic.h -> I _think_ we already get them for free; certainly I'm just "un-deleting" those which std::atomic already deleted. 

I guess it doesn't really hurt to mark them explicitly - change incoming.

Line:72, engines/ep/src/copyable_atomic.h -> oops :disappear:
