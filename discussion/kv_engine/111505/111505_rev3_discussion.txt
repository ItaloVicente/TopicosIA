DESCRIPTION:

MB-34812 [SR]: Timeout (abort) SyncWrites In-Order

SyncWrites must be completed (Committed or Aborted) In-Order. However,
when checking for timed out SyncWrites the ActiveDM removes _all_
SyncWrites which have timed out from the trackedWrites list (and
aborts them).

This can result in SyncWrites being completed out of order - for
example consider two SyncWrites where the expiry time of the first is
greater than the second:

    1:PRE(timeout=20) 2:PRE(timeout=10)

When checking for a timeout at t=10, seqno 2 will be timed out (and
Aborted). Later, at t=20 seqno 1 will be timed out, resuling in
out-of-order completion.

This manifests as an expectation failing in the flusher during update
of the High Completed Seqno:

    Expects(hcs > vbstate.highCompletedSeqno);

(i.e. high completed seqno should always increase).

Fix by only timing out SyncWrites as long as _every_ earlier SyncWrite
has also timed out - as soon as a SyncWrite is encountered which
hasn't timed out yet then stop.

Additionally add some more checks to catch this / similar problems
earlier, when SyncWrites are added to the completedQueue.
