DESCRIPTION:

MB-33784: Avoid flusher dedupe in DurabilityActiveStreamTest

In a future patch we will skip flusher dedupe for rocks and
magma and these tests would need tweaking as flusher dedupe
reduces the amount of items persisted in each batch at the
moment.

Add extra flushes to these tests to avoid flusher dedupe.
