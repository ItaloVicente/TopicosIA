DESCRIPTION:

Merge neo/6b697af92 into master

* commit '6b697af92':
  MB-55251: History flag clear in checkpoint if no retention configured
  MB-51967: Skip test_vb_file_stats_after_warmup under magma
  MB-55251: Always deduplicate if no retention window configured
  [BP] Fix memory tracking for memcached on OSX
  MB-54516: Update collection history configuration
  MB-54553: Handle NonHistory->History Memory snap transition at replica

*NOTE*

This merge brings to master also a forward-port of neo/a3069b1b1.
Reason:
- The original neo/4b6a1791d (MB-54553, included in the merge here)
  introduces a bug that is fixed in neo by commit 61e869e82 (MB-55337)
  (which comes later in the merge stack).
  But, the master branch contains already some unit tests (not present
  in neo) that are sensible to that bug.
- neo/61e869e82 intoduces another bug (MB-55520). Again, there are
  unit tests in master that are sensible to that, so to make master
  happy we need to forward-port here the fix for MB-55520, which is
  neo/a3069b1b1.
