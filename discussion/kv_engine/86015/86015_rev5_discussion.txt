DESCRIPTION:

MB-26938: Add support for explicit logger config settings section

Expand the settings interface to be able to parse a JSON object which
specifies the file logger's configuration. It aims to replace the
mechanism which loads the logger as an extension.

Change-Id: I7591955500dbbc2b72bd26bc92d95fa6120b2647

Line:2599, daemon/memcached.cc -> Why do we pass in the soname here (and not use the settings object?).. And wouldn't const std::string& be better / safer? (given that the function is called once in the lifetime of the process there is no reason to optimize away an extra memory allocation.

Line:1559, daemon/settings.cc -> Why should this be a string and not a boolean value?

I would have expected something like:

    unit_test = false;
    if (obj != nullptr) {
        if (obj->type == cJSON_True) {
           unit_test = true;
        } else if (obj->type != cJSON_False) {
           throw std::invalid_argument( ... );
        }
    }

Line:654, extensions/loggers/file_logger.cc -> I'd prefer initialize as that's whats used elsewhere.

Line:18, extensions/protocol_extension.h -> The rest of the code use the american way...

Line:2599, daemon/memcached.cc -> Yeah, string is probably the better choice.

I don't need to pass settings, since I can already access the global settings object.

I'm passing soname because I haven't linked file_logger.cc yet, so it still has to be loaded as a plugin. Also, I'm working on a file called "spdlogger.cc", which uses spdlog for file logging and is loaded in the same way. So I need a way to specify which file I want to load.

Line:1559, daemon/settings.cc -> My bad, I didn't realise that cJSON_True & False were used for bools. Fixed

Line:654, extensions/loggers/file_logger.cc -> Done

Line:18, extensions/protocol_extension.h -> Fair, will keep this in mind in the future.
Renamed all of them.
