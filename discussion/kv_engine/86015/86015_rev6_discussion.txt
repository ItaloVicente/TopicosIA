DESCRIPTION:

MB-26938: Add support for explicit logger config settings section

Expand the settings interface to be able to parse a JSON object which
specifies the file logger's configuration. It aims to replace the
mechanism which loads the logger as an extension.

Change-Id: I7591955500dbbc2b72bd26bc92d95fa6120b2647
