DESCRIPTION:

MB-44168: Remove corrupt dbfiles during startup

Creation of a vbucket file is not an atomic operation, so if a
crash occurrs while creating the file the corrupt couchstore file
may result in an endless loop where ns_server tries to create the
bucket, and ep-engine fail to initialize due to a corrupt file.

Creating a new vbucket file consists of a number separate steps:

1. create the file on disk
2. write the header to disk
3. Add a _local/vbstate document
4. commit.

If a crash occurrs between 1 and 2 we end up in the situation
in MB-44168. If we crash between 3 and 4 we would automatically
roll back to the header in 2 and fall back to create the document
again.

Instead of adding extra complexity to the system trying to detect
every time we want to open a new database file (there isn't a clear
call chain to couch-kvstore for that) we can clean up these "corrupt"
database files as part of startup.
