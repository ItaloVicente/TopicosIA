DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Simply KVBucket::getRandomKey

There was a bug in KBBucket::getRandomKey - see MB-31495, which
although has been fixed highlighted unnecessary complexity in the
implementation of the function.

This patch simplfies the implementation of the function by removing
the nested while loops.
