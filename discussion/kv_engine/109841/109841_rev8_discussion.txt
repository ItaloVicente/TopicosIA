DESCRIPTION:

MB-33332: Keep committed prepare in HashTable - Ephemeral

We need to keep the completed prepare in the HashTable so that any
subsequent prepares can re-use (or chain if there is a range read)
the same OSV to ensure that we have snapshot with unique keys.

Line:3167, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I think the same @todo-perf comment also applies here. Can you add a comment in a follow-up?

Line:3167, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Ah, that's fine. either way don't need to change this patch, as long as we know to look at it again.
