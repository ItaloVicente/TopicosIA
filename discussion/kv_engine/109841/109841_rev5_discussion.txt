DESCRIPTION:

MB-33332: Keep committed prepare in HashTable - Ephemeral

We need to keep the completed prepare in the HashTable so that any
subsequent prepares can re-use (or chain if there is a range read)
the same OSV to ensure that we have snapshot with unique keys.

Line:20, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> I think you can drop this now.

Line:632, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Shouldn't we also be checking wantsDeleted here (against committedSV->isDeleted()?

Line:3140, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Still seems like the creation of the Item is unnecessary here - can't we just call softDeleteStoredValue?

(Simlary in the else case below, after creating the copy via createSyncDeletePrepare)

Line:632, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Done

Line:3140, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> can do, but I think this will conflict with your change to ht.softDelete where you set to CommittedViaMutation

Line:3140, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> we would have to special case the change to Cm so that we only do Cp->Cm I suppose

Line:3133, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Style: Avoid else after return (https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#don-t-use-else-after-a-return).

Line:3140, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> True.

Let's leave the code as-is for now, but can you please add a @todo here mentioning that this potentially inefficient and we could avoid the Item creation with some changes to softDeleteStoredValue() ?

Line:3143, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Same here - no need for else.

Line:3156, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Same here - all above control-flow routes would already have returned.
