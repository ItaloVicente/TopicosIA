DESCRIPTION:

MB-33332: Ephemeral - Keep completed prepare in HashTable

For parity with abort, we need to keep the completed prepare in the
HashTable. We keep the complete prepare in the HashTable for abort so
that we do not purge it before replication or leak it on destruction
of the vBucket.

Line:601, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> replace with "isInFlightSyncWrite(pendingSv)"

Line:790, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> @Dave - I know your recent refactor was to avoid things like this but it was the easiest way to get something that works for now... Any ideas on refactoring this?

Line:790, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Trying to understand why you need this? 

Perhaps we should just always return a Prepared SV (if it exists), and then the caller (VBucket) can check if it's a prepare. If so, compare the HCS with it's seqno and only return ESyncWriteInProgress if seqno > HCS.

Essentially uplift the HCS check into VBucket?

Line:790, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> The extra param allow us to get away with only one search. We could uplift the check but in the case where we have a complete prepare we would still need to do a findCommitted to get the sv that we want to overwrite (if we are doing a normal mutation)

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think it's wider than this - we need to keep it so any subsequent prepares can correctly re-use (or chain to if range-read in flight) the same OSV so we maintain the invariant of only a single key is present per snapshot.

Can you update the comment msg along these lines?

Line:356, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Maybe expand this to state that for EP we always remove completed Prepares from the HT (hence anything we find is always in-flight)?

Line:1088, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> typo
