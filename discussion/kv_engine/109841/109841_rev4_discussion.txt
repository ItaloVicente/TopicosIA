DESCRIPTION:

MB-33332: Keep completed prepare in HashTable - Ephemeral

We need to keep the completed prepare in the HashTable so that any
subsequent prepares can re-use (or chain if there is a range read)
the same OSV to ensure that we have snapshot with unique keys.

Line:602, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> I don't think this clause should be necessary  - isPreparedMaybeVisible() should only be true for (in-flight) prepares which either came for warmup or repiica -> active transition. 

As such, when we complete a maybeVisible prepare maybe we need to change it's type away from MaybeVisible?

Line:833, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Nit: "valid" is probably the wrong word here, implies that calling on an SV (which is "invalid") would be an error. Prefer "Only applicable / only necessary..."

Line:835, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Note also that StoredValue / OrderedStored values, while "parent" / "child" classes don't use virtual inheritance to implement that, they use tag dispatch. 

As such (and given we typically access them via a StoredValue* base class ptr) you should do something similar to setValue():

  void StoredValue::setValue(const Item& itm) {
     if (isOrdered()) {
         return static_cast<OrderedStoredValue*>(this)->setValueImpl(itm);
     } else {
         return this->setValueImpl(itm);
     }
 }

(although in this case you can just make the SV case empty).

Line:3136, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Not sure this is correct - or at least might be unnecessary - _if_ we find that `v` is a completed Prepare in the HashTable (i.e. we get past the InFlight check just above), then we could just directly use `v` as the "new" prepared SyncDelete - and directly call updateStoredValue on it.

(In the case of Ephemeral with an active range-read we'd end up creating a new OSV for the prepared SyncDelete, but otherwise no new item is needed).
