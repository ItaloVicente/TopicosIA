DESCRIPTION:

Create two X.509 user certificates for testing

Rename the old from client.cert to "trond.cert" which represent
the user named Trond (which our unit tests have a user for)
and create a new one named "john.cert" for a John Doe which
we don't have a couchbase user for.

Add a unit test that we disconnect the connection as John
isn't defined as a couchbase user
