DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Removes need to record cursor names in a checkpoint

Replaces the list of cursor names used to record the current cursors
in the checkpoint, with a non negative count of the number of
cursors in the checkpoint.

Removes removeInvalidCursorsOnCheckpoint function from CheckpointManager,
which used the list of cursor names.  We never have invalid
cursors in a checkpoint as they are accurately added and removed.

Re-writes the getListOfCursorsToDrop function from CheckpointManager
to not require the list of cursor names.  The re-write of also removes
the need to use the isEligibleToBeUnreferenced function from Checkpoint
which checked if a checkpoint contained the persistent cursor by
iterating through the list of cursor names comparing with the name
"persistence".

Line:460, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> A general consideration on keeping this.

We could completely remove it by implementing a CheckpointManager::getNumCursorsInCheckpoint(Checkpoint&) that scans the CM::connCursors and counts the number of cursors in the given Checkpoint&.

That would avoid that we have to inc/decrNumOfCursorsInCheckpoint . 

The side effect would be that we the the complexity of the new CM::getNumCursorsInCheckpoint() would be linear in the CM::connCursors::size().

But, we have recently removed the "offset" (which was a kind of optimization for avoid the same linear complexity for when we have to calculate "itemsRemainingForCursor").

So it sounds like that at this stage we want to simplify rather then optmize.
Also, I don't think that the size of CM::connCursors can increase to a level that could cause actual runtime issues.
Thus my proposal.

Overtime expect the number of cursors to grow as we support more DCP clients, particularly via collections.

Line:460, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> As per discussion with Daniel and DR, we prefer to avoid any further non O(1) operation that is executed under CM::queueLock.
So ok with Daniel's approach.
