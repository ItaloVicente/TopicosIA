DESCRIPTION:

MB-27701: Use a UUID in the log messages

Generate a UUID whenever we build a connection object and
allow the user to reset this to another value as part of
hello.

If the key (agent name) starts with '{' the string is
treated as JSON and we try to parse it and pick out the
following attributes:

   a - The agent name
   i - The identifier to use in the log messages when
       referred to this connection.

The log messages for slow operations is changed to
the following format:

  <id>: Slow operation. [json payload]

The JSON payload contains the following attibutes:

    cid - The connection connection id followed by
          /<opaque> (the opaque is printed in host
          local byte order)
    duration - The duration for the command
    trace - The trace information for the command
    command - The name of the command

Example:

    35: Slow operation. {"cid":"c21fee83af4e7943/c21fee83af4e7943/0","duration":"20 ms","trace":"get.stats=331221786765:20721","command":"STAT key: dcp"}

Note: Clients who don't set a connection identifier
gets one assigned to them so that the log entry
won't be empty. The assigned id is the peername
for the connection (ex: "127.0.0.1:12345")

Change-Id: I47fa596013ae3156895e01a5e461a0600eb7635b

(5 comments)

Haven't looked at the testcases yet; comments so far...
Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> From the code it looks like this is limited to 32 bytes - probably should document this.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> So is this the same as the CID below?

Line:37, /COMMIT_MSG -> Maybe we should also always print the host:port ?

Line:628, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> Might want to explain where the 33 comes from - and ideally use a symbolic constant for here+getAgentName()

Line:182, daemon/protocol/mcbp/hello_packet_executor.cc -> Nit: There's a to_string(const_char_buffer) method which simplifies this a tiny bit.
