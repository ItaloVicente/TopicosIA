DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Cancel RangeScan that exceed some duration

A RangeScan cannot 'exist' indefinitely as storage cannot be released by
compaction. This commit adds a watch-dog task that is responsible
for 'force' cancelling any RangeScan that exists for longer than some
configuration defined duration (180 seconds by default).

This commit makes no attempt to allow a scan to complete even if it so
close to the end, when the time is up, the scan is cancelled. If the
scan is being continued at the time of cancellcation, a
RangeScanCancelled status is seen.
