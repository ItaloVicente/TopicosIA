DESCRIPTION:

Configuration: Add explicit addParameter() method

Add an explicit method to add new configuration paramters, instead of
having setParameter handle both use-cases (adding a new paramter and
changing an existing parameter's value.

This both makes usage more explicit (and avoids runtime code
potentially creating a new config parameter unexpectedly), and is also
in preparation for including the 'dynamic' field of a config parameter
(which should only be specified when creating a new param).
