DESCRIPTION:

Replace notification pipe FDs with libevent event_active()

Currently memcached uses a pair of sockets connected to each other to
perform notification between threads. Benchmarking shows this can be
costly - when running a pillowfight test with
durability_level=persist_majority, profiling shows 15% of the NonIO
thread runtime is spent sending notifications (via libc send()) to
front-end threads to inform them to wake up.

Libevent however already provides a mechanism to wake up an event
directly from a different thread via event_active(). This internally
uses the most efficient mechanism available on the platform - which
for Linux is eventfd(), available since 2.6.22 (2007).

Profling with using eventfd (via libevent's event_active()) reduces
the cost of notifying other threads from NonIO thread to 9% of total
runtime (down from 15%).
