DESCRIPTION:

Replace notification pipe FDs with libevent event_active()

Currently memcached uses a pair of sockets connected to each other to
perform notification between threads. Benchmarking shows this can be
costly - profiling shows 15% of the NonIO thread runtime is spent
sending notifications (via libc send()) to front-end threads to inform
them to wake up.

Libevent however already provides a mechanism to wake up an event
directly from a different thread via event_active(). This internally
uses the most efficient mechanism available on the platform - which
for Linux is eventfd(), available since 2.6.22 (2007).
