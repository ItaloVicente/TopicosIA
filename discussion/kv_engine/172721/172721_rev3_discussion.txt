DESCRIPTION:

MB-50841: Generate stat definitions from json

Replaces stats.def.h with stat_definitions.json.

Macro-driven stat definitions could be a little opaque when adding or
changing stats, and would become unwieldy if stat descriptions were
added.

To support future improvements, and increase readability, re-define all
stats in json.

This is a lot more verbose, but easier to understand at a glance.
