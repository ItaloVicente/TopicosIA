DESCRIPTION:

Fix const-correctness of FrameBuilder

While upgrading our code to use C++17's std::string_view class, I
noted that FrameBuilder::moveAndInsert() incorrectly modifies data via
a cb::const_byte_buffer (the first 'existing' argument).

Given this isn't even logically const-correct (we actually modify data
in the "const" 'existing' buffer), change it's type to
cb::byte_buffer.

This requires adding const/non-const overloads to a number of related
methods, hence the scope of the patch expanding to classes which are
used with FrameBuilder.
