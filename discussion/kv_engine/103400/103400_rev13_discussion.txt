DESCRIPTION:

MB-22005 Move from TimingHistogram to HdrHistogram

Move kv_engine to use HdrHistogram class, where we currently use
TimingHistogram class. This will allow the use of dynamic bucket
ranges and thus allows us to iterate over the data in multiple
different ways.

This patch also changes mctimings to no longer print out buckets
of a fixed width and will now display bucket data based on
percentiles.

Took another look at the complete changes - spotted a few things which need addressing / haven't been addressed yet:
Line:154, daemon/connections.cc -> You don't need the duration_cast as long as the add() method takes a std::chrono -related type (microseconds, milliseconds etc).

Line:38, daemon/protocol/mcbp/get_cmd_timer_executor.cc -> Seems like this should also be HdrMicroSecHistogram?

Line:69, daemon/protocol/mcbp/get_cmd_timer_executor.cc -> This comment seems inaccurate now - please update or remove.

Line:85, daemon/protocol/mcbp/get_cmd_timer_executor.cc -> As above, HdrMicroSec ?

Line:1129, daemon/subdocument.cc -> I think I may have already mentioned something along these lines, but have you checked that the durations of this blocktimer are such that microsecond resolution is sufficient?

Line:44, daemon/timings.cc -> Note you don't need the duration_cast - chrono will automatically convert to the correct unit for you (one good reason to use the strongly-typed std::chrono::milliseconds and similar types :)

Line:52, daemon/timings.cc -> Style: Prefer `auto*` when the thing you are assigning is actually a raw pointer - makes it clearer to the reader what the thing being referred to is - and that an object isn't actually being copied.

See https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#beware-unnecessary-copies-with-auto

Line:55, daemon/timings.cc -> Style - pointers are implicitly compared against nullptr in boolean context - prefer:

 if (histoPtr) {
     ...

Line:152, daemon/timings.cc -> How often do we call this method? Will it be too costly to return a copy of the Histogram each time - should we just install a (const) pointer?

Also - I note you're returning HdrHistogram and not HdrMicroSecHistogram which is the actual underlying type - is this correct?

Line:154, daemon/connections.cc -> duration_cast is necessary for ns -> us as discussed off line.
