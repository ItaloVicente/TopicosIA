DESCRIPTION:

MB-22005 Move kv_engine from TimingHistogram to HdrHistogram

Move kv_engine to use HdrHistogram class, where we currently use
TimingHistogram class. This will allow the use of dynamic bucket
ranges and thus allows us to iterate over the data in multiple
different ways.

This patch also changes mctimings to no longer print out buckets
of a fixed with and will now display bucket data based on
percentiles.

will send comments, where I've got up to..if that's OK?
Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> width

Line:154, daemon/connections.cc -> aren' we still in the chrono namespace from line 148?

Line:156, daemon/connections.cc -> should this be nanoseconds?

Line:70, daemon/protocol/mcbp/get_cmd_timer_executor.cc -> why's the const_cast required?

Line:418, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> wondered why you performed brace initialization here - but not below?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Technically you only appear to be moving memcached (the "daemon") over, not ep-engine.

Line:43, daemon/runtime.h -> It looks like this is logically a histogram of time values; specifically nanoseconds in the current implementation. 

Suggest you use HdrMicroSecHistogram (or possibly a HdrNanoSecHistogram - what's it's current range like?) - that way you avoid any possibility of getting units mixed up. (For example Dan's comment in connections.cc - if you use the typed histogram C++ handles the conversion between units).

Line:1129, daemon/subdocument.cc -> Similar comment here, can you check what our typical range is for this? If it's sub-microsecond then we probably want to keep the units as nanoseconds.

Line:155, daemon/timings.cc -> The `autoAlloc=false` case seems a little complex - in those scenarios the caller could just call `timings[opcode]` directly.

Line:42, daemon/timings.h -> 1. This probably doesn't need to be inline; suggest you move the implemntation to the .cc file.

2. suggest you use an array of unique_ptr for `timings`; then the array elements will automatically be freed by the default constructor (and then you don't even need to manually specify the dtor).

Line:60, daemon/timings.h -> Please document what this method does.

Line:70, daemon/timings.h -> Suggest adding a brief comment documenting this variable and why we are storing pointers.

Line:24, engines/ep/src/statwriter.h -> I don't see boost::optional used anywhere here - why do you need this header?

Line:22, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hdrhistogram_test.cc -> Again, doesn't appear boost::optional is used in this file?

Line:167, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hdrhistogram_test.cc -> uncomment or delete.

Line:169, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hdrhistogram_test.cc -> leftover debug?

Line:98, programs/mctimings/mctimings.cc -> This is somewhat tricky to follow - might be worth adding some comments to explain what you're doing.

Also - take a look at cb::time2text which might already so what you need here (convert a time value to a human-readable form).

Line:149, programs/mctimings/mctimings.cc -> Please document this.

Line:386, programs/mctimings/mctimings.cc -> Style: unless you're otherwise changing a line / function; avoid making whitespace changes as it just makes it harder to track back (git blame) when something "really" last changed.

Line:203, utilities/hdrhistogram.cc -> What is 'buckets low"?

Line:105, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Please document what the return value means.

Line:147, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Please document what this does; and what the argument means.

Line:163, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Please document this.

Line:194, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Does this comment need updating?

Line:206, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> to

Line:216, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Might be worth documenting why the magic `-1` here

Line:233, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Looks like it's shared below. Why are you using shared_ptr here?

Line:238, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Please document this.

Line:240, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Might be worth documenting that these values mean.

Line:42, daemon/timings.h -> Done

Line:24, engines/ep/src/statwriter.h -> there's a use of of auto that stores a boost::optional on line 82.

Line:22, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hdrhistogram_test.cc -> getNextValueAndPercentile returns a boost::optional but gets stored in an auto which is why we need to include this header.

Line:98, programs/mctimings/mctimings.cc -> Added comments. unfortunately don't think that cb::time2text is useful here as it produces a string that isn't consistent to the old format that mctimings produced.
