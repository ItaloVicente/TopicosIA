DESCRIPTION:

MB-22005 Move from TimingHistogram to HdrHistogram

Move kv_engine to use HdrHistogram class, where we currently use
TimingHistogram class. This will allow the use of dynamic bucket
ranges and thus allows us to iterate over the data in multiple
different ways.

This patch also changes mctimings to no longer print out buckets
of a fixed width and will now display bucket data based on
percentiles.
