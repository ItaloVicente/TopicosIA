DESCRIPTION:

MB-48038: Store VBucket& in CheckpointManager

The trigger for this change is that in following patches I will need to
callback into VBucket from CheckpointManager. There are multiple CM
functions already that take a VBucket& arg in input for the same, so
let's just store the VBucket& in CM instead.

This patch just replaces the existing CM::vbid with CM::vb&.
The follow-up will get rid of any VBucket& arg in CM functions and
fully use the new CM::vb&.
