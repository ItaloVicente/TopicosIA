DESCRIPTION:

MB-30893: Partial collection updates maybe exposed

set_collections can pass a manifest (json document) 
which makes many changes, i.e. adding and deleting more than
one collection. It is important that DCP only exposes the
new manifest-ID on the final add/delete of the manifest
update. This will ensure clients don't think they have
all changes from the new manifest until they really 
have received all of the changes.
