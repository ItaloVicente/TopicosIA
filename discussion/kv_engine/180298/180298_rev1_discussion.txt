Line:1217, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Note you can use expressions in defaults - e.g. "(25 * 1024 * 1024)" which improves readability.

Line:359, engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore_config.h -> We shouldn't really have this default listed twice - it just potentially confuses things.

The ctor already initialises to the value from config; I would just leave this defaulted here.
