DESCRIPTION:

MB-31810: Implement collection in memory high seqno

GSI need the ability to get the highest seqno of a colelction,
just like they already do for a vBucket. To supply the high seqno
for each collection via the VB_GET_ALL_HIGH_SEQNOS DCP command, we
need to add a per collection high seqno counter. This counter should
be incremented when an item is queued for this collection within the
checkpoint manager to the new highest seqno. This counter should be
monotonic and should be initialized from the persistedHighSeqno
counter.

(8 comments)
Line:421, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> as per other comments

Line:94, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> can reduce this if we keep as cHandle

File Comment: engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> overall this change could be reduced or split, all of the renaming should be moved or removed.
Line:695, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> A lot of this should be reverted back, hard to separate the real change from renaming

Line:765, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> do we know what the caller will do in this case, I think this method is part of the DCP consumer it would be very odd case and we need to be sure its properly logged

Line:768, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> maybe worth removing the name change to reduce how much this patch touches (better git history)

Line:2500, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I think this parameter can be removed completely or at least the name change undone?

Line:2810, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> another change which could be removed

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:765, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> this is only hit by the DCP consumer when the vb is in the backfillPhase state, otherwise we call setWithMeta
