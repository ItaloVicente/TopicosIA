DESCRIPTION:

MB-34189: Audit configuration.json for non-dynamic params

A number of configuration parameters which are currently defined as
'dynamic' (can be changed at runtime once a bucket is initialized) are
in fact not. Change to dynamic==false:

- alog_block_size: Access log block size - not currently dynamic and
  while it _could_ be made dynamic (for next Access log scan), doesn't
  seem worthwhile to make it dynamic.

- backend: Cannot change storage backend without deleting / recreating
  bucket.

- bucket_type: Cannot change between persistent / ephemeral bucket
  types at runtime.

- chk_remover_stime: Checkpoint remover sleep time. Currently only
  used at startup when task is created, _could_ make it dynamic but
  don't see a current need.

- collections_enabled: Cannot turn collections on / off without
  deleting & re-creating bucket.

- collections_max_size: Not possible to reduce max number of
  collections at runtime, so for now just make it static.

- conflict_resolution_type: Cannot change without restarting bucket.

- couch_bucket: Cannot change bucket name without deleting /
  re-creating it.

- data_traffic_enabled: Only read during initialization/warmup, hence
  meaningless to be dynamic.

- dbname: Cannot change on-disk storage path after startup.

- failpartialwarmup: Only read during warmup, hence meaningless to be
  dynamic.

- ht_locks: Cannot be changed once a vBucket is created.

- ht_size: Cannot be changed once a vBucket is created.

- item_eviction_policy: Cannot be changed without restarting the
  bucket (see Instant Karma...).

- max_failover_entries: Not straightforward to change dynamically, and
  doesn't seem worth the code changes to make it dynamic at this stage
  (I cannot think of why we'd need to change it).

- max_vbuckets: Cannot be changed without deleting & re-creating the
  bucket.

- max_threads: Used to explicitly set number of threads created
  (instead of calculating based on CPU cores), hence cannot be changed
  without restarting memcached process.

- max_num_shards: Cannot be changed with restarting the bucket.

- max_num_workers: Confusingly named param, actually used for bucket
  priority, which cannot be changed dynamically.

- uuid: Set by ns_server and never changes.

- dcp_backfill_byte_limit: Not currently changable at runtime (set in
  BackfillManager ctor), and doesn't seem worth the code changes to
  make dynamic.

- dcp_flow_control_policy: Not currently changable at runtime (used in
  EPEngine::initialize() to select which DcpFlowControlManager
  subclass to construct.

- dcp_scan_byte_limit / dcp_scan_item_limit: Not currently changable
  at runtime (set in BackfillManager ctor).

- magma_*: None of the Magma settings are currently dynamically
  configurable.

- rocksdb_*: None of the RocksDB settings are currently dynamically
  configurable.

- scopes_max_size: Not changable without restarting bucket.

- time_synchronization: No longer supported.

- warmup: Used to control if warmup runs; given that's a one-off event
  at startup it's meaningless to be dynamic.

- warmup_batch_size: Used during warmup, hence no point in making
  dynamic.
