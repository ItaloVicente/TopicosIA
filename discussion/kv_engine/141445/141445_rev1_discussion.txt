DESCRIPTION:

Assert that we have scheduled a compaction in runCollectionsEraser

Currently tests assume that this function will throw if we call it
and we have not scheduled compaction. This isn't the case though,
the function just schedules the compaction and runs it (as the
collection drop compactions are slightly delayed and we want them to
run instantly for tests).

Line:387, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Don't think its fully clear in the name runCollectionsEraser() that this also ends up scheduling the task as well and only adds the fact that the task wasn't scheduled before.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:387, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> This is a bit of a weird one. Whilst it does technically schedule a compaction at line 354 the reason we do this is so that we can run a the collection drop triggered compaction immediately; they are scheduled to run a number of seconds in the future when we persist the drop. That's what the comment at line 353 is trying to elude to. 

From the perspective of somebody writing a test I don't think that we really care if runCollectionsEraser technically schedules a compaction as it does what the name implies (runs the compaction). That it needs to schedule one is an implementation detail (one that I forgot until I questioned why we schedule a compaction at line 354). 

In my opinion putting the word "schedule" in the name of the function that we call when we want to run a compaction/erasure that has already been scheduled would add confusion as we would not expect to need to schedule it. If you can think of a better name then I'm happy to take suggestions. In the meantime I've added/moved/expanded comments so hopefully the intent is clearer.
