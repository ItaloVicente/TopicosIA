DESCRIPTION:

MB-30149: Convert EngineIface::item_* fptrs to member functions

Change EngineIface::item_set_cas(), item_set_datatype() and
get_item_info() from function pointers to pure virtual member
functions.

Remove set_item_info - for both default and ep-engines this has
identical behaviour to item_set_datatype().
