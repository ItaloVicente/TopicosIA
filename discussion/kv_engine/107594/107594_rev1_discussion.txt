DESCRIPTION:

MB-28031: Use GMock for test_dcp_cursor_dropping_backfill expectations

Test 'test_dcp_cursor_dropping_backfill' is intermittently failing on
CV jobs, however running locally it is very reliable. To assist in
determining exactly what is going wrong, change from our home-grown
'dcp_stream_from_producer_conn' mock to GoogleMock, adding in more
detailed test expectations.

When the test next fails, this should hopefully give more information
on how the test is diverging from the expected bahaviour.
