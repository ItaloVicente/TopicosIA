DESCRIPTION:

MB-35429: Move preparedSeqno check to ActiveStream::seqnoAck

Currently we check if we should process a seqno ack based on
whether or not the preparedSeqno is less than our ActiveStream's
lastSentSeqno. This should only be done if the stream is alive as
we should never attempt to process seqno acks for any dead Stream.
