DESCRIPTION:

MB-36631: Return ENGINE_TMPFAIL when failing to create sasl refresh thread

Previously we would disconnect ns_server if we failed to create
the thread to refresh the password database. ns_server don't like
that memcached is rude, and as a payback it'll kill memcached ;-)

This is a temporary failure, so we can might as well pass that
information on to ns_server.
