DESCRIPTION:

MB-31810: Track collection high seqno [1/2]

GSI need the ability to get the highest seqno of a collection,
just like they already do for a vBucket. To supply the high seqno
for each collection after restart/warmup without scanning the
entire database we need to persist a high seqno for each collection.

Add the requried code to persist and load the high seqno for each
collection in a similar way to the collection item counts.

In the case of rollbacks, reset the collection stats counter to the
value in the rolled back document.
