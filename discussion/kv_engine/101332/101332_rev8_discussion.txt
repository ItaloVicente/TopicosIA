DESCRIPTION:

MB-31810: Track collection high seqno [1/2]

GSI need the ability to get the highest seqno of a collection,
just like they already do for a vBucket. To supply the high seqno
for each collection after restart/warmup without scanning the
entire database we need to persist a high seqno for each collection.

Add the requried code to persist and load the high seqno for each
collection in a similar way to the collection item counts.

In the case of rollbacks, reset the collection stats counter to the
value in the rolled back document.

Line:247, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> same as comment for l256, a std::array could be clearer of the API, we don't expect values to be more than 2 entries

Later looking at the caller to this, we could just pass the values as two parameters rather than an array

Line:256, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> given this is fixed size, a std::array could be marginally more efficient and expressive

Line:42, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> why change this?

Line:2525, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> update comment

Line:2534, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> reference not needed for these values

Line:2605, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> related to comments on CollectionPersistedStats, I think this is easier to understand if you decode the leb data into named variables and construct the persisted stats from them. We should also test that the decoded buffer returned from decode_unsigned_leb128 is empty after the decode of the last stat.

Line:2616, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> If we've got here and stats is empty it would be an exception.

Line:611, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Deadcode? can't see function body

Line:2378, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> nit: whitespace change can be dropped (breaks formatting rules)

Line:2174, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> update comment

Line:1364, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> update comment

Line:229, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> public by default in struct, don't need this

Line:232, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> Obvious from function signature

Line:238, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> Don't need to specify :)

Line:250, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> Do we need this?
Very error prone

Line:262, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> I suggest we replace this wit getItemCount() and getHighSeqno()

Line:42, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> Don't need this for using in the initialization list

Line:44, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> Don't need this

Line:47, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> Remove this if you want to use the setX() below

Line:229, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> Done

Line:232, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> Removed

Line:238, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> Removed

Line:247, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> Just modified to do the LEB decoding for us here

Line:250, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> Removed. See last comment in file for explanation

Line:256, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> Modified this to do the leb encoding here. See next comment

Line:262, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> I modified the class to deal with the leb128 encoding for us instead of modifying couch-kvstore to use the fixed variables. The point of this is that couch-kvstore shouldn't have to do anything specific to encode our stats, it should just store them. When we want to implement this for magma/rocks we would just be duplicating the same code. Also used in the couchfile upgrade tool so I moved into a separate ep engine utility library as we don't want to be doing leb stuff in this header

Line:42, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> Done

Line:42, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> Was mistake, removed all underscore prefixes

Line:44, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> Done

Line:47, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> Other parts of the code relies on this.

Line:2525, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:2534, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> No longer necessary

Line:2605, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Done. Added check after decoding the stats. Decoding moved to CollectionPersistedStats

Line:2616, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Removed

Line:611, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Oops, meant to remove this
