DESCRIPTION:

MB-31830: Track collection high seqno [1/2]

GSI need the ability to get the highest seqno of a collection,
just like they already do for a vBucket. To supply the high seqno
for each collection after restart/warmup without scanning the
entire database we need to persist a high seqno for each collection.

Add the requried code to persist and load the high seqno for each
collection in a similar way to the collection item counts.

In the case of rollbacks and tombstone deletion (where we cannot,
if necessary, revert the persisted high seqno without scanning the
whole database) the persisted high seqno will potentially be
incorrect until the user writes some document to the given collection.
This is similar to how we currently deal with the vBucket high seqno.
