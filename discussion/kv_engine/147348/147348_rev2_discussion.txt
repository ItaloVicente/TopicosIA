DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Move auth handling in the connection to the front end

Only run the backend part of SASL authentication on the executor
threads, and then do the rest of the mapping within the front
end threads. By doing so we won't have any race condition
on the front end auth datastructures.

Tighten the authentication logic so that we won't update the
connection properties with usernames until a successful
authentication completes (previously we would update it half
the way there and then reset it back upon failures)

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Is there a particular race condition bug here (i.e MB?), or is this some theoretical case? If the latter, could you expand the details here of what the race is we are addressing.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is a reasonably large patch. This second part seems independent of the first - would it be straightforward to split it into two patches?

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> It was seen when I played around with adding cross client stats

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> It may be refactored out, but I'm not sure it makes the patch a lot smaller. I'll take a stab at that.
