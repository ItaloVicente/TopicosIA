DESCRIPTION:

Reduce the verbosity for MutationLog::~MutationLog

Don't log the explicit flush, close and done if there
are no entries.

This reduce the output to a single line:

    INFO (default) MutationLog{logPath:.7, blockSize:4096, blockPos:4, file:-1, disabled:0, entries:0, entryBuffer:0x7f06246ca8c0, blockBuffer:0x7f06246d6000, syncConfig:10, readOnly:0}
