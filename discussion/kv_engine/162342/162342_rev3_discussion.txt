DESCRIPTION:

Add template function to get command specific payload

Add a template function to avoid having to fetch the extras
and do reinterpret_cast all over the code (and keep it in a
single place).

The method should not be called before the validator ensured
that the header is correct.

Line:179, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> Can we add an assert that getExtdata().size() is equal (or maybe greater than?) sizeof(T) ?

Line:179, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> I agree it _should_, but from a pov of not crashing the system if we buffer overran it seems sensible to be robust and throw an exception instead of reading off the end of a buffer.

Line:179, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> But we've already ensured that. If we're going to do yet another size check here, shouldn't we also ensure that the extdata actually is within the frame's boundary and that the offset of it is correct etc..  (the previous code didn't do the extra size check either, just because we just checked it)

Line:179, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> Well, the caller _should_ have checked that, but this function doesn't know that ;)

Given this is where we are performing a reinterpret_cast and returning a reference to something from an arbitrary region of memory, it seems sensible for this function to actually check what is it doing is valid (given it also knows the size of extData).

I'm simply trying to avoid the possibility of buffer overrun-type vulnerabilities; the size check (testing .size() against a compile-time value) is going to be essentially free in terms of runtime, and it's one very simple line of code.

Line:179, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> It'll be a runtime and not a compile time check as extdata.size() isn't known at compiletime. We've already done the sizeof check as part of header validation

Line:179, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> Agreed, it's a runtime check against a compile-time size.

My point is not about the overall correctness of the entire code, it's the fact there's potential (if this function is used incorrectly) to return invalid data, hence we should be defensive and check the size and throw std::invalid_argument or similar if the size is wrong.

Line:179, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> Even with that check it is still possible to cause the system to crash because we don't know if the section returned by extdata() is valid. it could be a bogus packet

Line:179, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> Well, that's a different problem ;) - a std::string_view (or cb::const_byte_buffer or similar) should only ever have extent over actual valid memory.

I was arguably imprecise in my previous comment when I said "there's potential to return _invalid_ data" - what I meant by that is there's potential to access undefined memory (e.g. if extData.size() is less than sizeof(T).

At the end of the day, if we want to try to avoid memory-related issues (buffer overruns etc) in C++ we need to make sure that when switching between different representations of the same underlying memory we check that we are not accessing undefined memory addresses.

I see that we _do_ use the result of getCommandSpecifics() where the fields in the struct could be logically invalid (say using some enum value outside the range), but that's not going to segfault etc if we access it - which is the case here.

Line:179, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> except that we've already checked for the size when we validated the packet header and there is no need of doing it again.
