DESCRIPTION:

MB-53053: Expose the NoBucketTaskable to use in the quota sharing pager

The quota sharing item pager will need a common synchronisation point.
It makes sense to use the NoBucketTaskable for that, as it is outlives
all buckets. A custom taskable defined in ep-engine would not get
unregistered before the ExecutorPool is shutdown (the executor pool is
created in daemon/memcached.cc).

This change exposes the NoBucketTaskable as an ExecutorPool's "default"
taskable.
