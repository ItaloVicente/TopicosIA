DESCRIPTION:

MB-48038: Move checkpoint expel/removal logic to CheckpointVisitor

Before this change, the CheckpointRemoverTask would:
1) Do a full scan over the VBMap and try ItemExpel on every VBucket
2) Do again a full VBMap scan and CursorDrop to make checkpoint eligible
   for removal
3) Pass the execution over to the VBCBAdaptor/CheckpointVisitor, where
   the VBMap is traversed again and CheckpointRemoval attempted on all
   visited VBuckets

With this change:
1) The CheckpointRemoverTask only determines if memory recovery is
   neeeded. If so, it spawns a CheckpointVisitor run and tells it how
   much memory it has to try to release.
2) At this point everything happens in the Adaptor/CheckpointVisitor,
   so we traverse the VBMap just once.
3) At each VBucket visit, the visitor tries (in order) ItemExpel ->
   CursorDrop -> CheckpointRemoval on the single VBucket before moving
   to the next one.

Apart from removing complexity and avoiding multiple VBMap scans, the
change moves toward prioritizing CheckpointRemoval over ItemExpel,
which is something that we'll definitely want when we'll start
allowing more than just 2 checkpoints in each VBucket.
