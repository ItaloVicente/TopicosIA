DESCRIPTION:

MB-48038: Move teh CursorDrop logic to CheckpointVisitor

Before this change, the CheckpointRemoverTask would:
1) Do a full scan over the VBMap and try ItemExpel on every VBucket
2) Do again a full VBMap scan and CursorDrop to make checkpoint eligible
   for removal
3) Pass the execution over to the VBCBAdaptor/CheckpointVisitor, where
   the VBMap is traversed again and CheckpointRemoval attempted on all
   visited VBuckets

With this change:
1) ItemExpel is still performed in the CheckpointRemoverTask
2) At this point the CheckpointRemoverTask just determines if more
   memory needs to be released. If so, it spawns a CheckpointVisitor run
   and tells it how much memory it has to try to release.
3) Everything happens in the Adaptor/CheckpointVisitor loop, so we
   traverse the VBMap just once.
4) At each VBucket visit, the visitor tries CursorDrop/CheckpointRemoval
   on the single VBucket before moving to the next one.
5) What left to release is recomputed at each vbucket visit and the
   visitor stops accordingly, so we avoid to scan the entire VBMap again
   for CheckpointRemoval if not needed
