DESCRIPTION:

MB-29287: Give each ActiveStream a unique cursor name

To ensure that when the background snapshot processor task runs
and we have closed/created the ActiveStream, if the task gets a handle
on the closed stream we must be sure it does not obtain items destined
for the new stream. Previously with each ActiveStream just using the
name of its producer, the closed stream was able to drain items which
the new stream needed.

Adding a monotonic atomic to the ActiveStream class and appending a
new value to the name we use for the cursor ensures concurrent streams
cannot interfere with each other.

Looks good. The only query would be what you mentioned about clients calling registerCursor() more than once - is that an issue here where we'd end up with multiple cusors registered?

What I saw was the same stream calling register twice (it was in a cursor-dropping test too which actually validated how many cursors exist after the test), so in this patch it's ok because the same name is used by the stream. 

The extra verification I do need todo is to ensure there's no Stream to dead path which leaves its unique name registered

Sounds good. I guess we are actually ok for the same ActiveStream object to re-register the cursor; as the name is only unique per ActiveStream, not per invocation of registerCursor() - which is one difference between this and the weak_ptr approach.

Also will cherry-pick the test which I used to highlight the issue, it's on master at the moment... also might not be something we want to commit as it puts a std::function callback into the task to inject the close/create

Line:272, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Consider the following case. Lets say we replicate to two nodes here, one named 'node' the other one 'node1'. We create replication to node1 and the counter is 0. Then after some time replication to node when the counter is 10. Now you have to totally different replications using the same cursor.

Line:272, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> ns_server happens to put the bucket name in the end of the connection name. So it saves us from the case I described. But a malicious client could craft a name that causes this sort of conflict. So I still leave my -1 in place.

Line:272, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Good spot. I think it should be sufficient to add an extra seperator character between the user-provided name and the cursorUID - that way we guarantee the suffix is always unique.
