DESCRIPTION:

MB-28327: Initialize all storedValue with correct frequency count

When we construct a StoreValue object either being passed an Item or
a StoreValue object to copy, make sure we initialize with the correct
frequency counter.

For temporary items that value is 0, otherwise it is the
ItemEviction::initialFreqCount.

Line:71, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> This is somewhat implicit - the fact you need a comment to say that the `resetValue` method actually resets the frequency counter isn't very clear.

Note additionally that given this is the constructor, you've already assigned `itm.getValue()` to `value` - so (a) we are adding extra work here to re-assign a member we already set and (b) the Item itself arguably should already have the correct freqCounter.

In other words, I think you should remove the change here, and instead ensure that Items are created in the first place with the correct FreqCounter - given that Item includes that state in it's own `value` member.

... However, do you actually /want/ Item to have the frequency Counter in it? If not, then you should change the type of Item::value to a non-tagged Blob, and keep code similar to this here.

Line:101, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> I think this is redundant (although maybe useful as it's explicit); as the assignment of `value(other.value)` at line 87 should already handle this.

Line:35, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stored_value.h -> Style: I've generally named these methods something like `public_setBySeqno` - which helps the reader in tests to see this is a mock-specific method which is doing something the normal object can't.

Line:71, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> As discussed, getting the frequency count from Item.  So ensuring Item has the correct frequency counter set.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:101, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> Yes it is redundant in that the assignment does handle it - have inlined a comment so the reader is reminded that frequency counter is set.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:35, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stored_value.h -> Will remember for the future.  However in this case the function no longer required and so have removed.
