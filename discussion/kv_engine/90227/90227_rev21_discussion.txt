DESCRIPTION:

MB-28327: Initialize all storedValue with correct frequency count

Changed the constructor of an Item from taking a NRU value, which
almost always uses the default value, to instead be initialized directly
to INITIAL_NRU_VALUE.  Then in the two places that we used to initialize
with a different value, we explictly set the NRU value.

Wth the above change in place, we initialise the FrequencyCounter in a
similar manner to the NRU value.  This ensures that storedValue is
initialized with the correct frequency count.

The frequency counter should be initialised to
ItemEviction::initialFreqCounter.

(1 comment)
Line:37, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> As a cleanup; given we aren't actually using the tagged aspect of value_t we should probably change this to take a SingleThreadedRCPtr<Blob> directly (ie.. without the TaggedPtr).

Or an alternative would be to change value_t (as used by the various interfaces etc) to be SingleThreadedRCPtr<Blob> - what it used to be - and then just use the TaggedPtr variant in the implementation of Item and StoredValue.

Thanks, when I've dealt with the performance regressions I will come back and clean-up as you recommend.
