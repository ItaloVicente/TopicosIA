DESCRIPTION:

MB-35060 [SR]: Match prepared/committed status when rolling back HT items

When removing items from the HashTable due to rollback, only the
Item's key was used when looking up the StoredValue. As a consequence,
if both a committed and prepared item existed in the HashTable then
the wrong StoredValue could end up being removed.

Ensure that the item state (pending / committed / aborted) is used in
addition to the key when looking up the item to remove. This is done
by changing VBucket::deleteKey() to take an Item instead of a DocKey;
additionally it is renamed to VBucket::removeItemFromHashTable() to
more accurately reflect it's (clarified) purpose.

As part of this, enhance the RollbackDcpTest tests to use the same key
for prepare as the initial base items. This tests additional code
paths which expose the aforementioned bug.
