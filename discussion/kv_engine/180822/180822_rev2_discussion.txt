DESCRIPTION:

MB-53942: Fix checkpoint low/upper marks computation at quota reduction

Incorrect computation might also generate illegal values for the marks.
Code was already silently failing in successfull BucketQuotaChangeTest.
The same tests fail now (before the fix) by adding sanity checks in
BucketQuotaChangeTask::prepareToReduceMemoryUsage().

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Can we add to the unit tests for this also? I guess that that is coming in the next change to fix up the reset to the correct values on successful change?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Correct - I m fixing only the incorrect computation of "temporary ratios" here, and that is already widely covered by the existing unit tests now that I've added the new logic checks in the prod code.
I'm deferring the rest to a dedicated patch (where I ll add dedicated test coverage too).
