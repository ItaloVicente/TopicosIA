DESCRIPTION:

MB-53942: Fix checkpoint low/upper marks computation at quota reduction

Incorrect computation might also generate illegal values for the marks.

Code was already silently failing in successfull BucketQuotaChangeTest.
The same tests fail now (before the fix) by adding logic checks in
BucketQuotaChangeTask::prepareToReduceMemoryUsage().
