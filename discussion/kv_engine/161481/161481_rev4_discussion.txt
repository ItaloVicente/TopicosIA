DESCRIPTION:

MB-48441: Don't throw if maybeUpdatePurgeSeqno() can't get vb pointer

Don't throw if KVStore::CompactionContext::maybeUpdatePurgeSeqno() is
unable to get hold of a point to the vbid's vbucket, as an implicit
compaction can be running after the vbucket has been removed from the
vbucket map.

Also only update the purge seqno if its greater in an atomic manner.

Line:1239, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> We should also look at the higher-level exception handlers - IIRC this bug caused memcached to crash as the exception was uncaught; we should probably have a catch at a suitable location such that compaction throwing in this way doesn't crash the entire process...

Line:1239, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Ah see your point, though as this is an implicit compaction we might need to get the magma team to make a change. Given that this is callback is being called by magma in one of their task threads and doesn't go directly though the normal compaction methods. Though can sure up those to catch any exceptions too, might be cleaner if I do it in another patch? Also can remove any exceptions that might be thrown in  MagmaKVStore::compactionCallBack to just return failed, instead of throwing.

Line:1239, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Another patch is fine.

re: Magma vs ep-engine; yes, we need to clarify what Magma's contract is regarding the compaction context - does it handle the compaction context throwing an exception or should the compaction context never throw?
