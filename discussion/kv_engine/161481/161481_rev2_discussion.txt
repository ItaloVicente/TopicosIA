DESCRIPTION:

MB-48441: Don't throw if maybeUpdatePurgeSeqno() can't get vb pointer

Don't throw if KVStore::CompactionContext::maybeUpdatePurgeSeqno() is
unable to get hold of a point to the vbid's vbucket, as an implicit
compaction can be running after the vbucket has been removed from the
vbucket map.

Also only update the purge seqno if its greater in an atomic manner.
