DESCRIPTION:

MB-30865: [1/n] Add unsigned_leb128 encode/decoder and tests

Add a decoder and encoder (with tests) to cb::mcbp namespace.

These methods are intended for use with reading from the network
and encoding outgoing packets (and even disk meta-data).

Line:38, include/mcbp/protocol/unsigned_leb128.h -> I'm thinking about what's the nicest API here - assuming one is trying to decode a sequence of unsigned values, I think it would be nicer if the second return was say the remainder of the input buffer, so you could just pass that into the next call to decode. For example something like:

 uint64_t seqno;
 uint32_t revid;
 const_char_buffer metadata = ... // some buffer
 std::tie(seqno, metadata) = decode_unsigned_leb128(metadata);
 std::tie(revid, metadata) = decode_unsigned_leb128(metadata);

With the current design I think you end up having to do more manipulation of the input buffers - something like?

 uint64_t seqno;
 uint32_t revid;
 const_char_buffer metadata = ... // some buffer
 size_t index;
 std::tie(seqno, index) = decode_unsigned_leb128(metadata);
 metadata.start += index;
 metadata.len -= index;
 std::tie(revid, index) = decode_unsigned_leb128(metadata);
 metadata.start += index;
 metadata.len -= index;

Line:55, include/mcbp/protocol/unsigned_leb128.h -> Should we also add a check that we don't get to the end of the input buffer without encountering a zero top bit? (i.e. implying the data has been cropped).

Line:59, include/mcbp/protocol/unsigned_leb128.h -> Probably also worth documenting this class / the constructor.

Line:72, tests/unsigned_leb128/unsigned_leb128_test.cc -> Suggest adding a couple more tests of a handful of input values in the valid range - say 1, 10, 100, 254 for uint8_t; 1, 10, 1000, for uint16_t etc.
