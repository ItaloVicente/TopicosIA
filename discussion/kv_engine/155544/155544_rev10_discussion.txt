DESCRIPTION:

MB-46827: Introduce KVBucket::hasCapacityInCheckpoints()

The function verifies whether checkpoints memory conditions allow a new
item to be enqueued for persistence and replication.

With this patch we start enforcing the new checkpoint quota for ADD/SET
operations.
A follow-up patch will cover DEL/EXP.

Note that currently the checkpoint_memory_ratio is set to 1.0 in
configuration, so the memory behaviour of the system stays logically
unchanged.
