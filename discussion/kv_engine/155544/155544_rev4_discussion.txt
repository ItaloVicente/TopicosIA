DESCRIPTION:

MB-46827: Introduce KVBucket::hasMemoryInCheckpoint()

Used at VBucket add/set, same as where we verify our existing memory
conditions.
Currently the chk_mem_percentage is set to 1.0 in configuration, so the
memory behaviour of the system stays logically unchanged.

Line:2729, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Note all the accessor methods on Configuration require taking a mutex. If this function is going to be called frequently, you probably want to look at caching getMaxSize and getChkMemPercentage and adding listeners to update the cached values if/when they change.

Similary for getVBucketsTotalCheckpointMemoryUsage - it isn't cheap as it must iterate all vBuckets.

You will probably have to either look at caching / pre-calculating getVBucketsTotalCheckpointMemoryUsage(), or pre-assigning each vBucket with a fraction of the quota it is allocated and doing the checks at a per-vBucket level. That would obviously mean one "busy" vBucket would only get a small fraction of the overall memory allocated (possibly an issue for rebalance etc where we move only a couple of vBuckets at once) - but it would simplify the issue somewhat. 


I suspect ultimately we'll need something a bit like how mem_used is tracked - there's a per-bucket counter of all memory allocated to all checkpoints; possibly shared by core/thread so writing is fast, but reading would need to periodically merge in the different values.

Line:757, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> I think this would be better named to something like "checkpointManagerHasCapacity" or "checkpointManagerCanEnqueue"

Line:2729, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Removing any call into Configuration by using the EPStats copies for maxSize (already there) and checkpointMemoryRatio (adding it).

Working on a solution for getVBucketsTotalCheckpointMemoryUsage.

> pre-assigning each vBucket with a fraction of the quota it is allocated and doing the checks at a per-vBucket level..

I wanted to avoid that. Apart from the possible rebalance issues, that would penalize workloads that touch a fewer number of vbuckets. While from the user perspective I would expect to use the memory/quota if there's some available.
