DESCRIPTION:

MB-26729: [2/n] Allow memcached to limit expiry

Update the mc_time_convert_to_real_time function to accept a
cb::ExpiryLimit, which is a type that can carry an upper bound on
the expiry we calculate.

mc_time_convert_to_real_time is exposed to the engines through the
server API so we will be able to update any relevant engine so that
it can begin limiting expiry to a value of its choice.
