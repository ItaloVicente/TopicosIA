DESCRIPTION:

MB-26729: [2/n] Allow memcached to limit expiry

Update the mc_time_convert_to_real_time function to accept a
cb::ExpiryLimit, which is a type that can carry an upper bound on
the expiry we calculate.

mc_time_convert_to_real_time is exposed to the engines through the
server API so we will be able to update any relevant engine so that
it can begin limiting expiry to a value of its choice.

Line:44, include/memcached/server_api.h -> Passing this as an "optional" seems like an extra complexity to me, as that's what we've got with "0" today (infinite expiry)... so anything != 0 would be a limit..

Line:44, include/memcached/server_api.h -> I want to be future proof, of course I don't really have a good use case for why you would want a 0 expiry limit, but in 0 is a valid limit and with ::optional being available, using optional to represent the enabled/disabled rather than a reserving a value from the integer range feels more future proof

Line:257, programs/engine_testapp/mock_server.cc -> might change this as I have tests upstream which use mock and would be good to test the limit behaviour as if memcached were running

Line:44, include/memcached/server_api.h -> +1 to using boost::optional.

Line:141, include/memcached/types.h -> Maybe add a brief description to this type?

Line:44, include/memcached/server_api.h -> 0 means infinite expiry when you try to store an item, and in this case it would mean the same... 

Anyway. we should probably make a constant for an empty optional, as I don't find realtime(exptime, {}); very readable ;)
