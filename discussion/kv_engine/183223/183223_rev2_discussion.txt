DESCRIPTION:

kv_slow_ops_2_gtrace: Move tests after production code

Recent additions to this file have meant the tests were in the middle
of the main code.

Move them to the end, just before main() - which has to be at the end
for the automatic test registration to work.

Also remove a leftover 'print(obj) in one of the unit tests.
