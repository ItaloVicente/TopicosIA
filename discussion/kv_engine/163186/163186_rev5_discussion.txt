DESCRIPTION:

MB-47604: Move rollbackPurgeSeqno update into new ctx class

The intent of this change is twofold. We want to:

a) Allow NexusKVStore to track a maxPurgedSeqno without having to add
it to the CompactionContext (as no production KVStore needs it). We
will accomplish this in a future patch by using a subclass that overrides
purgedItem to update a Nexus specific value.

b) Move all of the purgeSeqno updating logic into one place for
KVStores that manage multiple "purgeSeqnos". MagmaKVStore is the
issue here which tracks the rollbackPurgeSeqno in the
CompactionContext and a purgeSeqno in MagmaDbStats. The CompactionContext
one is used for updating in memory stats, and the MagmaDbStats is the
authoritative on disk version. When we update one, we also need to udpate
the other so this change allows us to subclass and override
updateRollbackPurgeSeqno to do this for us.
