DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: Add HistoryRetentionAvailable to StorageProperties

Add a new property to differentiate KVStores that can (if configured)
retain a history of changes. The name of this property is trying to
say the KVStore is capable - but may not actually store history as
the retaining of history is under dynamic configuration.
