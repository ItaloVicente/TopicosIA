DESCRIPTION:

MB-30302: Preparation for change to runtime verbosity changing 2/2

Modify the ServerLogIface to get and set spdlog level enumerations
instead of EXTENSION_LOG_LEVEL. This is required in the changes to
runtime verbosity changing.

Remove the old Logger class within ep engine as all uses have now
been removed. Further, remove the set_level method in the
EngineIface as the new BucketLogger class does not support a global
log level which the old Logger class did. This is only used when
memcached changes verbosity at runtime and has been simply removed
in favour of not creating additional methods to retain the functionality
that will not be useful after the next patch set.
