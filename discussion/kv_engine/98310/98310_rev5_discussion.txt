DESCRIPTION:

MB-30302: Preparation for change to runtime verbosity changing 2/2

Modify the ServerLogIface to get and set spdlog level enumerations
instead of EXTENSION_LOG_LEVEL. This is required in the changes to
runtime verbosity changing.

Remove the old Logger class within ep engine and its few remaining
uses as this would require rework to keep at this stage.

This patch set will break runtime verbosity changing for loggers
other than the globalBucketLogger but this will be reintroduced in
the next patch set to avoid further rework.
