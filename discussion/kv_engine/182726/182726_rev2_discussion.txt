DESCRIPTION:

MB-53859: Expose Snappy datatype in KEYS_ONLY result for CouchKVStore

Couchstore compresses items at persistence if they do not already
have `datatype&Snappy` (and have a non-empty value). The datatype is
not altered at this time, but the fact that the item has been
compressed by Couchstore is recorded in the docinfo:

 docinfo->content_meta & COUCH_DOC_IS_COMPRESSED

However, when reading items, couchstore will:

* Decompress the value iff filter == VALUES_DECOMPRESSED
* Add Snappy to the datatype iff filter == VALUES_COMPRESSED

This means a KEYS_ONLY request may read a non-snappy datatype even if
the underlying value _is_ compressed.

This is not a problem, but is inconsistent with Magma and causes issues
with nexus testing. In general, it is good for the KVStore impls to
behave similarly.

Thus, change CouchKVStore to report a Snappy datatype to a KEYS_ONLY
request if it compressed the value when it was persisted.
