DESCRIPTION:

Simplify memcached/engines.h

Forward-declare types not directly needed by <memcached/engine.h>
(such as collections.h), moving the inline methods which previous
needed them to their own .cc file.

Reduces cost of including memcached/engine.h from:

    39506 ms: ../kv_engine/include/memcached/engine.h (included 143 times, avg 276 ms)

to:

    13763 ms: ../kv_engine/include/memcached/engine.h (included 144 times, avg 95 ms)
