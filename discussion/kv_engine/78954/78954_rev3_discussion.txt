DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Add new state for executing a command

This makes the code easier to understand when looking at
the connection stats... (Is it currently executing a command
or is it waiting for the buffer to fill up. You can currently
see that by looking at the rlbytes, but this makes it even
more intuitive)
