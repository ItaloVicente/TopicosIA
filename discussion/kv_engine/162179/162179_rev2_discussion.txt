DESCRIPTION:

MB-41403: Increase default and max NonIO threads

With recent changes to allow concurrent expiry pagers (this MB) and
concurrent eviction pagers (MB-35075), the number of potential NonIO
tasks with a default config is increasing.

<Pending perf test logs>
Bumping the numbers arbitrarily, building a toy and getting logs/metrics
Notes:
* "underloaded" envs shouldn't be negatively impacted by increasing the
  number of threads; if the tasks aren't running heavily/for long
  other tasks (NonIO and otherwise) shouldn't see degredation or
  improvement
* Environments where the NonIO threads are running a task near 100% of
  the time (e.g., bulk load + multiple replicas/other components +
  eviction)
** With too few NonIO threads, NonIO tasks may face high scheduling
   delay (impacting things like DCP in-memory throughput)
** Accordingly, increasing NonIO threads in that situation should be
   reflected in scheduler stats as decreased scheduling delay
** Other tasks may suffer if the number of NonIO tasks and threads is
   excessive, but should not be starved in an absolute sense - NonIO
   threads may contend for CPU time, but all should still get _some_ time
   allocated by the OS.
