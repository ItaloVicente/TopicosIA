DESCRIPTION:

MB-55584: Handle an empty chain ptr in hashChainRemoveFirst

If called with an null chain ptr, hashChainRemoveFirst would
erroneously dereference the ptr to check getNext().

This has gone unnoticed, as most uses of hashChainRemoveFirst have just
found the relevant StoredValue by walking the HT, and the lock is still
held. Thus, hashChainRemoveFirst is rarely used in a situation where
the value is not present, or by extension, situations where the chain
is entirely empty.

hashChainRemoveFirst already has provision for not finding the
requested item; it can return a nullptr. For consistency with this,
return a nullptr if the chain is empty.

There is the argument that if most usages of hashChainRemoveFirst
always expect to find the requested item it could be more useful to
throw in this case.

However, callers generally check for nullptr and handle it appropriately
already, so leave throwing to the caller.

Line:1482, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> I'm not sure I agree with this assessment. If the user wants to remove something from the chain, they _should_ pass in a valid chain - i.e. arguably we should have an Expects(chain) here to assert our preconditions are as expected.

Line:1482, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> But the chain isn't _invalid_ as such, just empty?

Consistency argument:

* Chain contains 1 item, is not the desired item (doesn't match pred)
 -> nullptr
* Chain contains 0 items (so none _can_ match pred)
 -> gsl expects failure? (or currently, segfault)
