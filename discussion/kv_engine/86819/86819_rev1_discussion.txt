DESCRIPTION:

MB-27224 [RocksDB] Fix RocksDBKVStore::getStatFromProperties

The numeric RocksDB stats from Properties are of type uint64_t, so
we need to use 'std::stoull' for the string-to-numeric conversion.
Also, when we get ColumnFamily aggregate stats we need to initialize the
output value to 0 because it is passed as a non-initialized size_t& by
the caller (KVBucket::getKVStoreStat).
