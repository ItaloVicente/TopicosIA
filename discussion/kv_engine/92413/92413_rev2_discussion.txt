DESCRIPTION:

MB-29184 CouchRocks: Expose new stats to debug the 'scan' function

R-0 Rebalance tests show poor performance of disk Backfill.
As we never delete the old Seqno->Key mappings from the SeqnoCF, the
execution of 'RocksDBKVStore::scan()' may lead to reading the same
document multiple times from disk.

With this change I introduce the new 'scan_totalSeqnoHits' and
'scan_oldSeqnoHits' stats to measure the impact of keeping old seqnos
when performing a Backfill.
