DESCRIPTION:

MB-29184 CouchRocks: Expose new stats to debug the 'scan' function

R-0 Rebalance tests show poor performance on disk Backfill.
As we never delete the old Seqno->Key mappings from the SeqnoCF, the
execution of 'RocksDBKVStore::scan()' may lead to reading the same
document multiple times from disk.

In the 'scan()' function we perform two main steps:

1) For every Seqno, we retieve the Key from the SeqnoCF (Seqno->Key
    mapping);
2) For every Key, we retrieve the document Body from the DefaultCF
    (Key->Body mapping).

Currently we never delete old seqnos from the SeqnoCF, so we
may end up performing a full Document read multiple times for a
single document. That happens for all the document that have been
updated at least once. E.g. (note that Body=Metadata+Value):

1) document A is created:
    SeqnoCF:    {(Seqno_A1, Key_A)}
    DefaultCF:   {(Key_A, Body_A1)}
2) document A is updated:
    SeqnoCF:    {(Seqno_A1, Key_A), (Seqno_A2, Key_A)}
    DefaultCF:   {(Key_A, Body_A2)}

So essentially we may have multiple entries in the SeqnoCF (the last
seqno plus all the previous seqnos of previous mutations), all
pointing to the same latest entry in the DefaultCF.

Also, the current implementation of 'scan' is sub-optimal. Using the
example above:
1) we start iterating through the SeqnoCF
2) we find (Seqno_A1, Key_A)
3) we perform a point lookup from the DefaultCF for Key_A
4) now we have Body_A2. We retrieve the seqno, which is Seqno_A2.
    Note: under RocksDB we always need to get the entire document for
        retrieving Metadata (e.g., seqno) as Metadata are stored in
        a single Slice together with the Value into the DefaultCF.
5) we compare the seqnos and find that (Seqno_A2 > Seqno_A1)
6) as we always want the latest seqno, we go to step 1) and repeat.

In the example above we end up performing a point lookup for Key_A
twice.

We want to measure the impact of keeping old seqnos when performing
a Backfill, so we add new scan-stats for accounting:

1) 'scan_totalSeqnoHits': the number of total hits in the SeqnoCF
    (which is equal to number of times we perform a point lookup
    from the DefaultCF)
2) 'scan_oldSeqnoHits': the number of "useless" point lookups caused
    by old seqnos in the SeqnoCF
