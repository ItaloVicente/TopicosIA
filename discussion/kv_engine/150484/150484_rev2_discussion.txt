DESCRIPTION:

MB-45495: Make ActiveStream::endStream() take DcpProducer&

ActiveStream::endStream() is called when we end a stream and may
call into the DcpProducer to reset buffer sizes or tell it that
the stream is ready. Currently ActiveStream::endStream()
accomplishes this by promoting the producerPtr and only doing these
things if the producer is alive.

Change ActiveStream::endStream() to take a reference to the
DcpProducer as it's generally called via the DcpProducer. A few
cases exist where it is still called by background threads which
must be addressed. To address these cases, simply avoid calling
endStream() if the producer has already been destroyed.
endStream() has no effect if the producer does not exist anymore.
It sometimes attempts to queue a StreamEnd to the readyQueue but
without a producer nothing can be sent. In the call to
transitionState(StreamState::Dead) we remove the checkpoint cursor
which can free some memory. In this case the background task should
be the sole owner of the std::shared_ptr<ActiveStream> and it will
be destroyed almost immediately as we return up the call stack. The
dtor of ActiveStream removes the checkpoint cursor if the stream
is not in the Dead state.
