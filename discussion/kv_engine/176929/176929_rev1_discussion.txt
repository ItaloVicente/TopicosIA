DESCRIPTION:

MB-44253: Test: Should crash if GlobalTask::run throws

Add a regression test for MB-44253 - tasks which (incorrectly) throw
exceptions result in the process getting terminated (uncaught
exception).

Note that GlobalTasks *shouldn't* throw, but if they do we want to
treat that as a fatal error as there isn't a good way to handle
background tasks failing otherwise.

To achieve this with Folly we needed to patch it to not catch
exceptions in it's runTask() methods.
