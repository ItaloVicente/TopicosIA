DESCRIPTION:

MB-54801: Avoid purging stale items while referenced by older items

Stale items may have a "replacement" pointer set, pointing to the newer
version of the value.

This is used during seqlist scans for backfill, to determine if the
replacement appears in the range of seqnos the backfill covers. This is
used to avoid having multiple versions of a value in a given backfill.
Stale items can't be unconditionally skipped, as that could lead to _no_
version of a value being sent in a backfill.

The pointed-to value can itself be made stale if the document is
updated again. This leads to:

 V1(Stale) -> V2(Stale) -> V3(New)

This is fine. _However_, the stale item purger may pause, releasing its
range lock (to avoid blocking backfills for a long time). If it
happened to pause between the seqnos of V1 and V2, once it resumes it
may purge V2.

This would leave V1 with a dangling replacement ptr:

V1(Stale) -> XXXXX      ... V3(New)

This is unsafe; a subsequent backfill would read from garbage memory,
potentially leading to a crash or an incorrect backfill.

In _principle_, this could be fixed by updating the replacement ptr to
point V1->V3.
This might appear to risk consistency issues e.g., "what if a new
backfill covered seqnos including V1 and V2, but not V3? It would
incorrectly see an older version V1, the document would appear to have
reverted". However, that particular scenario would not be possible;
backfills will always end at the high seqno at the time of their
creation; a new backfill would always include V3 as well.

Stale items can not be purged while there are ongoing backfills
locking a range of seqnos including the stale item, so there is no
concern for existing backfills.

However, locating the _previous_ version of a document in the seqlist
would be costly.

A simpler approach (which is the one taken in this patch) is to forbid
purging stale items while an older stale version still points to them.

This patch achieves this by adding a bit flag indicating if _this_
OrderedStoredValue is the replacement for an older version.  This is
set when the new OSV is appended to the seqlist, and is cleared when
the older stale version is purged (the old version holds a pointer to
its replacement, so it is easy to find the new value and clear this
flag).

In the above case, that would make V2 ineligible for purging until
after V1 is purged; this ensures versions of a value are purged in
the order they were created.
