DESCRIPTION:

MB-27215: Warmup the item counts

Each collection stores its current item count to a _local document.
When we warmup we must initialise the collections manifest entry
with the current item count so we can then continue to track a
correct value.

Line:843, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> Nit: `getItemCount` hasn't got anything particularly "collectiony" about it; so the naive reader (me!) might think this is the overall item count of the file. Maybe quality to getCollectionItemCount or similar?

Line:507, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Nit: Please shuffle up to the same order as the enum (after LoadingData)

Line:1331, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Should we make this fatal? What are the downstream consequence of not being able to open a vb here?

Line:1331, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> I've removed this - possibly left over from bring up. Looking at other warmup tasks, this isn't considered fatal, however I'm quite sure if this did happen, something weird has happened. The first step of warmup is to create VBucket's in the store/vbmap based on what is on disk and shardVbId is initialised at the same time, so later to find a vb in shardVbId but not in the vbMap would be unusual - so could re-instate with a throw/fatal?
