DESCRIPTION:

MB-51132: Only reset tasks on eventBase during unregisterTaskable

Currently all task pointers are reset on the eventBase
(scheduler thread) to make the unregistering of a taskable (engine)
faster as we have to wait for all tasks to be freed before we can
free the engine. These changes were made as part of MB-49512 as
we would often see rebalance failures if long running tasks caused
a delay in execution of the resets of the task pointers. This has
caused a regression in P99.9 latencies in a SyncWrite Rebalance
test, and we suspect that that is due to the scheduler thread having
to do more work which delays the scheduling of other tasks.

To address this regression, we can change the normal method of
resetting the task pointers back to being run on the cpuPool, and
only during unregisterTaskable will we reset task pointers on the
scheduler thread as we do not want to wait for cpuPool workers to
become available. We need to do a bit more than just that though,
as it's possible that a reset of a task pointer is currently
enqueued on the cpuPool when we come to unregister a taskable and
we do not want to requeue that along with the work for other
taskables as we will still have to wait for cpuPool workers to
become available. Instead of requeueing that work, we can identify
the reset pointer tasks as they are not associated with a GlobalTask
and manually run them on the scheduler thread.

These changes will restore the old (pre-MB-49512) status quo in
regards to the normal operation of the ExecutorPool, and only
negatively impact things during an unregisterTaskable call. Compared
to current master an unregisterTaskable call may be a bit slower as
we need to run any pending reset task pointer tasks, and other
buckets that are not being unregistered may be impacted during this
call, but only for the duration of the unregisterTaskable.
