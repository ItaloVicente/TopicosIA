DESCRIPTION:

MB-55336: Checkpoint is resilient to History Retention on/off

A configuration change on retention bytes/seconds might enable or
disable History. If that happens, the mutations processed after that
configuration change must be queued into a new checkpoint that has the
correct/new History flag set.

The patch covers both retention bytes/seconds, so does test coverage.

Line:3107, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> It maybe sensible to now add an early return if the bytes parameter is the same as the current setting - just so we don't trigger all of this code when no change occurs (same for the time path).

Line:3139, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> can't this just be read? We only need to ensure the vbucket stays active.

Line:3107, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Indeed - actually I had considered to be smarter (eg trigger checkpoint creation only if the config change ends up in CDC on/off), but then decided to go with the simplest logic (assumption is that these setting are expected to be rarely changed)
But yes, let's prevent useless checkpoint creation here - doing

Line:3139, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> It was supposed to be ReadHolder - fixing
