DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add kvstore protection to guard against dropped kvstore

A delVbucket can happen at any point from a thread other than the
bg_flusher thread. We need to protect the magma wrapper calls from
having the kvstore ripped out while they are active. This is different
than couchstore which relies on file reversion.
