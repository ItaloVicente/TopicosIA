DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add kvstore protection to guard against dropped kvstore

A delVbucket can happen at any point from a thread other than the
bg_flusher thread. We need to protect the magma wrapper calls from
having the kvstore ripped out while they are active. This is different
than couchstore which relies on file reversion.

The shardMutex is used to coordinate between getting a shardHandle,
which is a shared_ptr and delVBucket which will grab the shardMutex in
exclusive mode and wait for all shardHandles to fall out of scope.

Magma has similar code to protect itself from the same thing. In order
to reduce locking, we can tell magma that the wrapper code will do the
sychronization so that locking can be avoided in magma.
