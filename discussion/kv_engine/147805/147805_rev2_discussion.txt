DESCRIPTION:

CBSS-611 magma-kvstore: Add should_log checks for trace logging

At some places we prepare log message arguments for trace logs without
checking the logger's level. Some of these args are expensive, eg
DiskDocKey::to_string() which shows up in perf profiles. This change
adds should_log checks around such statements.

> Note that the _theory_ of our logger is you just pass (a reference to) any type to be printed, and the logger itself performs the stratification by calling the type's operator<< if necessary (i.e. log level is enabled).
> 
> The issue with DocKey is that (a) it doesn't have an operator<< and (b) we need to wrap it with user data tags (<ud>...</ud>) for log redaction.
> 
> The ideal way to address this (which would solve the problem everywhere) would be to define something like a UserDataDocKey which wraps (takes a reference) to a DiskDocKey, and defines it's own operator<< - the call would look something like:
> 
>  logger->debug("Some key:{}", UserDataDocKey(key));
> 
> That would construct a simple wrapper type but that should be very cheap, and only if the level was enabled would it call the operator<< which would be something like:
> 
>  std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const UserDataDocKey& ud) {
>      os << UserDataView(ud.dockey.to_string());
>      return os;
>  }
> 
> ... but having said all that; the manual if() checks around the expensive calls are fine.

Let me give that a try in a separate patch.

Line:1658, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> This is missing UserData tags (unrelated to your change I know but would be good to fix).
