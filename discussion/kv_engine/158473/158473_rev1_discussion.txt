DESCRIPTION:

MB-47197: Generate cbsaslpw.json as part of test setup

Previously we used a pregenerated cbsaslpw.json file in all
of the unit tests, but that don't allow for tuning the new
limits (as it's stored in the source directory).

Refactor the code to generate it inside the test directory
during startup to allow tests to modify it.
