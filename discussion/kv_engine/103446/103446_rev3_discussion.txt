DESCRIPTION:

MB-32535 [SR]: Notify SyncWrite client when request complete

When a SyncWrite request is complete, notify the client which make the
request so the response can be sent back.

To do this we use notifyIOComplete() method on the engine; however
unlike other existing instances where the notification is done by a
background task; we are calling it from the DurabilityMonitor which
doesn't have direct access to the engine instance. Additionally unlike
existing EWOULDBLOCK notification for stores this isn't a idempotent
operation - if we performed the store() again then that would cause
/another/ mutation to occur. To solve this, we:

1. Define a new SyncWriteCompleted callback object, an instance of
   which is passed into VBucket when it is created. This is typically
   instantiated with a function / lambda from KVBucket which calls
   engine.notifyIOComplete().

2. From VBucket::notifyClientOfCommit() this callback object is
   invoked.

3. Inside EPEngine::storeIfInner() if this is a SyncWrite operation,
   use engineSpecific to record that this is a SyncWrite which has
   successfully been prepared, and that the next call to store()
   should simply return the completed status & CAS of the
   now-committed item.

just a minor one
Line:718, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> worth using your 'typedef' SyncWriteCompleteCallback (and in the .cc)

Line:2320, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Ok so all this has not been clear to me at first look, mainly because I didn't consider the way we use EWOULDBLOCK for a Durable write.
This is my understanding now:

1) new Durable store (item is Pending)
2) we process the prepare in KVBucket::set, which returns EWOULDBLOCK
3) memcached gets EWOULDBLOCK and the connection is paused
4) when the Durable Write is committed, then we notify the connection and memcached repeats *exactly the same operation*: that means that the item in input here is still "pending", even if the Durable Write has been committed
5) that s why we need to use something for signaling the Committed write: we use EngineSpecific to signal that we are executing for the second time

If we don't do that, then we would end up with memcached repeating the same operation indefinitely.

Is my understanding correct ?

If it is, maybe we want to highlight in comments that by logic the second execution for a Durable Write happens only after the write has been committed?

Yes

I think it's covered in the comment block at line 2385. I'll do a follow-up patch (don't want to re-do CV) which references that one from here.
