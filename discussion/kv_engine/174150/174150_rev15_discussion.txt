DESCRIPTION:

MB-51681: Decouple Checkpoint::MemoryCounter from its Destroyer

Remove setMemoryTracker() to remove an unnecessary coupling between
Checkpoint's MemoryCounter and the CheckpointDestroyerTask.

Before, when a Checkpoint was queued for destruction, all of its
MemoryCounters would have their parents changed to point to the
destroyer - which did not scale well. The new implementation (renamed to
 removeParent) simply removes the parent, subtracting each
 MemoryCounter's value from it.
