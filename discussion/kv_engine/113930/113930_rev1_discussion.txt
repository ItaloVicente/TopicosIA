DESCRIPTION:

MB-35703: Collection filter must decompress system events

An exception occurred because a snappy compressed flatbuffer 'blob' was
passed to the flatbuffer verify code.

Fix by calling Item::decompressValue (which is a no-op if the value is
not snappy compressed) before using the system-event value.
