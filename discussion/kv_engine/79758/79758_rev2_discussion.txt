Line:159, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> we've been moving towards vb:<vbnumber> as the style for logging

Line:248, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> as above "vb:%" PRIu16

Line:2033, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> as prior comments

Line:497, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> as prior, and PRIu16?

Line:511, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> vb:

Line:553, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> vb: & PRIu16?

Line:159, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> With all the other DCP logs printed as (vb <vbnumber>), keep that format helps while searching through DCP logs while debugging.
Hence I thought will keep it the way the other DCP logs are.

Maybe change all DCP logging to vb:<vbnumber> in a future commit ?

If the commit is good enough, plz merge it in the Manchester time.. Tommie/Arun are running the longevity test more often and it would be good to debug with these logs

Line:159, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> why not change it now? you can always grep for both formats, ultimatley people want to grep "vb:" across all component logs
