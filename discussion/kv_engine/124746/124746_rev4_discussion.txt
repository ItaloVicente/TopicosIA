DESCRIPTION:

MB-30044: Modernize kv_engine using clang-tidy modernize-use-nodiscard

As part of enabling the modernize checks for clang tidy ensure we're
using [[nodiscard]] in appropriate places. This as the statement
[[nodiscard]] to add compile time checks that ensure a values are used
after being returned by method. For more information on the check please
see https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-use-nodiscard.html.

I'm not convinced about the value of this change. It adds a _lot_ of line noise to many many methods (11 characters), and assuming it can't be worked around makes the ASSERT_EQ calls looks very odd.

The guidance in the standard library[1] (which isn't an application, but is interesting to consider) suggests the following:

>     * not using the return value is usually an error.

I personally think the usage in this patch is a lot more aggressive than that, and I'm not convined it's worth the churn.

Thoughts, comments anyone?

Quote form the no-discard checks's rules.
Member functions need to satisfy the following conditions to be considered by this check:
* no [[nodiscard]], [[noreturn]], __attribute__((warn_unused_result)), [[clang::warn_unused_result]] nor [[gcc::warn_unused_result]] attribute,
* non-void return type,
* non-template return types,
* const member function,
* non-variadic functions,
* no non-const reference parameters,
* no pointer parameters,
* no template parameters,
* no template function parameters,
* not be a member of a class with mutable member variables,
* no Lambdas,
* no conversion functions.

Clang-tidy will also apply a macro for us across the code base instead of [[nodiscard]] if we would prefer to use something like that instead e.g. MUST_USE, USE, NO_DISC or ND?

I fully agree its an intrusive change, and think the specs guidance is probably where we want to use it. However, I believe we'll need to change it in all locations like this if we want to enable the clang-tidy rule otherwise we'll need to disable it explicitly. It means its use is less likely to be picked up as their will be no prompt to do so (in my option). 

I think though we should open this up to the team as more of a discussion?

I guess my point is more - maybe we shouldn't bother enabling this clang-tidy check - I'm not convinced the pros outweigh the cons.

Indeed - hence commenting publicly on Gerrit ;)

Line:147, cbsasl/password_database_test.cc -> Currently EXPECT_NO_THROW never uses the value returned by the argument function and thus will cause the compiler to warn.
To fix this I've used a variable to store the result, probably cleaner is to explicitly cast it too null asper the warning definition from clang: https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#nodiscard-warn-unused-result.
