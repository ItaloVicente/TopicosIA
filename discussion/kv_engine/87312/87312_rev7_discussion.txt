DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: Add Logarithmic Counter

Provides counter functionality so as the counter increases it becomes
increasingly more difficult to increment.  This enables a high
granularity counter to be implemented using only a small number of bits.

The actual counter is not held within the class as it is typically the
bits stored in a taggedPtr.

Through experimentation it has been determined that you need a logFactor
of:
- approx 14000 to mimic a u32int counter (max value of 4,294,967,295)
- approx 2 to mimic a u16int counter (max value of 65,535)

For example to replace a u16int counter with a logarithmic counter that
only requires 8-bits of storage, you would need to construct a
LogCounter as follows: LogCounter<uint8_t> logCounter(2.0);

It would be used as follows:

uint16_t counter{0}; // Currently we are using uint16_t even though only
                     // 8-bits of storage are actually used.
counter = logCounter.generateCounterValue(counter);

The generateCounterValue can be called approximately 65,000 times before
the counter becomes saturated at 255.

Line:61, engines/ep/src/log_counter.h -> Thinking some more on this, wondering if we should give this a more descriptive / accurate name - something which suggests it's approximate / statistical in nature. What do you think?

Line:89, engines/ep/src/log_counter.h -> Suggest you remove this as it's arguably not relevant now / overly-specific.

Line:61, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/log_counter_test.cc -> Is it possible that these could fail if we got "unlucky" (given the counter is statistical?)

If so, I'd suggest removing them.

Line:61, engines/ep/src/log_counter.h -> changed to StatisticalCounter - to reflect the fact that the counter increment is based on statistical behaviour. (I did think of ProbablisicCounter but thought that was not as good).

Line:89, engines/ep/src/log_counter.h -> Done

Line:61, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/log_counter_test.cc -> Removed test - as it is covered in the previous test.
