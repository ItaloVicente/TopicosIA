DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: Add Log Counter

Provides counter functionality so as the counter increases it becomes
increasingly more difficult to increment.  This enables a high
granularity counter to be implemented using only a small number of bits.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might be wroth expanding this to "Logarithmic" in the title to distinguish from "logging"

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Would also be useful to give more detail here - what's the range of the counter etc?

Line:20, engines/ep/src/log_counter.h -> Style: you can flip the order of these (so we only include <random> if the header hasn't already been included).

Line:43, engines/ep/src/log_counter.h -> This probably needs more expanation - how are these magic numbers derived / used?

Line:63, engines/ep/src/log_counter.h -> This feels like you're mixing the current user of this class with generic functionality - other users of this code might not want to limit to 255.

Suggest you make this limit a parameter of the object (at construction time) - say defaulting to std::numeric_limits<uint16_t>::max() if not specified.

Line:74, engines/ep/src/log_counter.h -> Not sure you want these members static - it would make this class non-thread-safe; and moreover would mean different instances share state.

Suggest you remove the static, and simply have a single instance of this class per VBucket (or similar).
