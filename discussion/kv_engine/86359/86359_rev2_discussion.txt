DESCRIPTION:

MB-27099: Don't try to dereference stl containers in connections stats

The connections stat don't try to lock the object it inspects,
so if the connection is used by a different worker thread the
containers could be resized or modified behind our back.
The code tried to access the elements, which could have been
invalidated and causing a crash.

Given that the details is of limited value, lets just drop
dumping them.

Line:994, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> These are definitely thread-safe - as they are const (see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) so we can keep them.

Same for the other calls to size().

Line:994, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> That a method is const doesn't necessarily imply that it is thread safe. Just because _this_ thread don't change any internal state doesn't mean that other threads can't do that (and cause this thread to misbehave). Calling a const method only indicates that _I_ won't change the state of this object.

I can add the size call back (although I'm not seeing which problems you'll resolve by knowing them... )

Line:994, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Hmm, I think I misread http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container (Thread Safety) - I was thinking the const methods were safe in the presence of mutations, but it doesn't actually say that.

Let's go with what you've got for now.
