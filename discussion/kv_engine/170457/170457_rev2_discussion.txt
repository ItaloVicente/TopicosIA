DESCRIPTION:

MB-50647: Remove ConnMap::releaseLock

The releaseLock was originally designed to synchronise cookie release
and notification. Once released, it was no longer correct to notify the
associated connection.

Since https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/167564/ the cookie has
been managed in an RAII manner - if the ConnHandler still exists, the
cookie is still reserved.

As such, if a shared_ptr is held, there is no danger of the cookie
being concurrently released, so the lock is unnecessary.
