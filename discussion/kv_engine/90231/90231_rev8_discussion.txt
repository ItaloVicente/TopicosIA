DESCRIPTION:

MB-28327: Set frequency counter for restoreValue/Meta

RestoreValue and restoreMeta is called after performing a background
fetch.  Therefore we want to initialize the associated frequency
counter to ItemEviction:initialFreqCount.

Line:920, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> I don't think this is necessary/desired - `stats vkey` will put the value back into the hashTable to be able to tell the user about it.  If we were to expand `stats vkey` to include the frequency counter (not a bad debugging aid) then we should maintain whatever counter the item had when it was fetched. 

It seems like the freq counter that the item got during bgfetch should be maintained - or if it doesn't currently have a value then that would be the correct place to set this.

(To look at this another way - I'm not sure the setFreqCounterValue should be public on Item - the freqCounter should be set on creation and then never modified).

Line:92, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Uncomment or delete.
