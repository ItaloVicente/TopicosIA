DESCRIPTION:

MB-47604: Create b KVStore in ABKVStore

Create the B KVstore in the ABKVStore (defaults to a magma instance).
This highlights an issue where we run tests against magma if it exists
in the ABKVStore but not stand-alone. Magma can't handle being
reconfigured with a different number of vBuckets (which is/was being
done in an ItemPager test) so we need to skip this test if we are
running the ABKVStore with magma as we'd fail in the ctor. We should
also skip all of the ItemPager tests that are memory sensitive as
the presence of magma will cause them to fail.
