Line:1620, daemon/memcached.cc -> I'm not sure we should necessarily make this interface be const. 

I think that that ideally/eventually  this interface should actually be implemented by the class which represents the Server document (CommandContext?) - and the `cookie` argument would be removed and instead the `this` pointer would represent the object. Once we get there; the actual implementation of pre_link may well not be const; so imposing it on the interface is probably too harsh.

(Note this is essentially what I did with the DcpInterface - it's implemented by the Connection/Cookie objects).
