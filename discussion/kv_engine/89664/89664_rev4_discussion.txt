DESCRIPTION:

Use unique_ptr for Configuration::addValueChangedListener

addValueChangedListener() takes ownership of the passed-in listener
object, but only if the specified key exists in the config. If not,
then it results in a memory-leak as the listener object is passed as a
raw pointer.

Fix this problem (and in general make resource ownership more
explicit) by passing by a unique_ptr<>.
