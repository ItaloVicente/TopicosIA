DESCRIPTION:

MB-32591: Re-Introduce ChkPtQueueIterator

The initial patch had a performance issue due to performing a "deep"
compare of the CheckPointIterator container objects.

The effected code was:

auto operator==(CheckpointIterator ci) {
return (ci.iter == iter && ci.container.get() == container.get());
}

when should have been:

auto operator==(CheckpointIterator ci) {
return (ci.iter == iter && &(ci.container.get()) == &(container.get()));
}

This has been addressed and a corresponding performance benchmark has
been added.

Also in the original patch it did not convert the getLowSeqno and
getHighSeqno methods to using using the new iterator.  This has been
addressed in this patch.

-- Original commit message --

To help reduce memory usage we want to be able to remove items from the
checkpoint queue where all cursors are to the right (i.e. the items have
been processed) and hence don't need to be held in the queue.

The first step in this is to wrap the checkpoint queue iterator, (an
iterator on a stl::list) in a special iterator that automatically
skips passed elements that contain null pointers.

Line:39, engines/ep/benchmarks/checkpoint_iterator_bench.cc -> I don't think you need any of the functionality here. Unless you're using this in a later patch suggest just deleting it and using a plain `int` - otherwise maybe you need to add an equality operator?

Line:77, engines/ep/benchmarks/checkpoint_iterator_bench.cc -> Style: the benchmark framework is supposed to manage iteration counts etc, that way the timings you get per iteration mean something in the absolute sense instead of just being something you can only compare relatively.

I think you can simplify this significantly, given all you care about it is operator performance. Something like:

 // Populate the test container.
 // create two cursors, say both at the beginning.
 while (state.KeepRunning()) {
     benchmark::DoNotOptimize(cursor == cursor2);
 }
