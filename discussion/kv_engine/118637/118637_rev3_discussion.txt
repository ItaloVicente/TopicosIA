DESCRIPTION:

MB-36948: Track and store maxVisibleEndSeqno in Checkpoints

Replica VBuckets will set the maxVisibleEndSeqno end based on the DCP
snapshot marker.

Active VBuckets track a second seqno whilst queueing mutations and will
use that value to set the maxVisibleEndSeqno.

Note on tests using "createSnapshot": to avoid a default parameter
the createSnapshot method has been updated in many unit tests and
in some places what seems like the correct maxVisibleSeqno is
added and sometime later tested. Many tests though are just using
zero, as for many tests the maxVisibleSeqno isn't of interest.
