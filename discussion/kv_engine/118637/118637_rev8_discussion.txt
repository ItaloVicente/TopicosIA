DESCRIPTION:

MB-36948: Track and store maxVisibleEndSeqno in Checkpoints

Add a maxVisibleEndSeqno to Checkpoint and then maintain that
value for active/replica.

Replica vbuckets set this value on receipt of a snapshot-marker.
They will either call createSnapshot or updateCurrentSnapshot both
methods now require the visible snap-end value. The value then
remains in the Checkpoint object and is now visible to subsequent
DCP producers (producing the replica) or readable from
CheckpointManager (which will be wired into GetAllVBSeqnos).

Active VBuckets track/set the maxVisibleEndSeqno in a way which
mirrors the visible seqno (which is CheckpointManager::lastBySeqno).
As items are queued (queueDirty) lastBySeqno is increased and
the current Checkpoint will have it's end seqno adjusted.
The same logic applies to a new member, maxVisibleSeqno
which only increments for visible items.

Note on tests using "createSnapshot": to avoid a default parameter
the createSnapshot method has been updated in many unit tests and
in some places what seems like the correct maxVisibleSeqno is
added and sometime later tested. Many tests though are just using
zero, as for many tests the maxVisibleSeqno isn't of interest.

Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)

Partially reviewed
Line:683, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Duplicate, we have getSnapshotVisibleEndSeqno() above

Line:703, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Maybe worth a small description here

Line:906, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> This maybe a problem, depending on how we use it.
Similar to recent issue faced with HCS, I ll update this comment as soon as checked other code around.

Line:906, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I think it's a problem because we will choose the max MVS for any checkpoint we visit here. As we only return 1 MVS this will be the highest one. Should we then send a snapshot without a comitted item (in your next patch), we will send an MVS higher than the snap end (i.e. from the last Checkpoint we visited). Using the one only from the first Checkpoint seems fine if we are going to update the sent MVS as we see items in ActiveStream

Line:906, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> *Examples (assuming SR-connection)*


[1]

CM: [PRE:1, CMT:2] [PRE:3)

From here we return:

result {
    items: {CS, PRE:1, CMT:2, CE, CS, PRE:3}
    MVS: 2
}

Then the new ActiveStream code (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/118462/12/engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc) will send:

SnapMarker{1, 2, MVS:2} + PRE:1, CMT:2
SnapMarker{3, 3, MVS:2} + PRE:3

All good.


[2]
Here we had a closed checkpoint [PRE:1, CMT:2], now removed. Is it the scenario you're describing @Ben?

CM: [PRE:3)

From here we return:

result {
    items: {CS, PRE:3}
    MVS: 2
}

Then the new ActiveStream code will send:

SnapMarker{3, 3, MVS:2} + PRE:3

It seems fine too.


@Ben Am I missing something?


Looking at test coverage anyway.

Line:906, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Pasting Ben's example here:

> example my previous comment was based on:
CM:[1:PRE][2:ABT, 3:MUT)
When we call getItemsForCursor we return
IFC:[1:PRE, 2:ABT, 3:MUT] with MVS of 3
We send to the replica then a snapshot with snap start 0/1, snap end 1 and MVS 3 as the prepare at seqno 1 is not visible. We then send the second snap with start 2, end 3 and MVS of 3. I believe this is correct based on the code in this patch and the following one, but please correct me if I'm wrong.


By removing this line, we would just let the new code in ActiveStream to re-compute the MVS, using the first-checkpoint-mvs as baseline value.

Line:906, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Indeed, I think this solution will work correctly when combined with the following ActiveStream patch if this line is removed

Line:906, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> agreed, just updating tests, might put something in the next patch too which demonstrates Ben's sequence, i.e. where the cp-start trigger a marker with the wrong MVS
