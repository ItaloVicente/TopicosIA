DESCRIPTION:

MB-34694: Apply the Bucket Minimum Durability Level

With this change, the Durability Requirements of any write-request are
upgraded to the Bucket Minimum Durability Level, if the bucket min-level
is higher than the level specified by the user in the write-request.

The bucket min-level is applied at
EventuallyPersistentEngine::store/store_if/remove, as they handle all
the operations that we support for Durability.

Note that:
 - Applying the bucket min-level may turn a normal-write into a
   sync-write.
 - The level upgrade does not modify the original Durability Timeout,
   which stays unchanged.

Line:43, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> Is this needed because boost::optional is already used in code elsewhere? If not it might be nice to use std::optional instead

Line:3953, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> IIRC our gtest version is too old for GTEST_SKIP() isn't it? One day we will be able to use that in this sort of case 😄

Line:4082, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> Hmm, this might be higher than the SDK's "normal" (not durability) operation timeout, which would lead to client timeouts before ambiguous responses would be sent. Not a problem with the change, just came to mind as something to ponder 😊

Line:43, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> None necessary actually ;)

Line:3953, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> > too old

correct

Line:4082, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> That is an interesting point.

So far we have been discussing an opposite issue for SDK2: NormalWrite gets upgraded to sync-write, and possibly returns Ambiguous to a client that doesn’t know about SyncRepl. Issue solved by error-mapping.


In the case you describe it could be that the clients (whatever SDK version) get SDK-timeout in place of Ambiguous.. but:
- the (original) semantic of SDK-timeout is “write surely failed”
- while, the semantic of Ambiguous is “:shrug:”


But there is still another case: a client gets SDK-timeout but the (slow) SyncWrite succeeds..

In the PRD this matter is just mentioned, maybe worth to expand.
It appears that, if bucket durability_min_level>None, the SDK-timeout should be set to a value > ServerDefaultTimeout (30s currently).

But even by doing that the issue is not 100% solvable.. We may even set a huge SDK-timeout, the SyncWrite completes (in some way) within 30secs.. but then (eg) we may be very slow in notifying the client-connection.. and the SDK-timeout may trigger again.

I think that the SDK just accepts since when SyncWrites were introduced (ie, no level-upgrade involved): the SyncWrite may even succeed very quickly, but we may fail to notify the client-connection within the SDK-timeout.
