DESCRIPTION:

MB-34173: 2/2 Check for illegal snapshot in vbstate document

Prior to the fix for MB-34173 the persisted snapshot can be
illegal, we should check for obvious illegal state and take
action.

Active VBs with invalid state gets reset to valid state, e.g.
start=end=high-seqno

ReplicaVBs will be ignored, we will warmup without them and
the janitor will correct KV and set a new replica which rebuilds
from 0.
