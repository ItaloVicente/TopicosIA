DESCRIPTION:

OpenSSL: Mute deprecated warning when building on OpenSSL 1.1

ERR_remove_state is currently a noop

From the documentation:

    They are now deprecated and do nothing, as the OpenSSL
    libraries now normally do all thread initialisation and
    deinitialisation automatically (see OPENSSL_init_crypto).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:220, daemon/thread.cc -> Actually I might be wrong - the wording is a bit unclear, but from https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man3/ERR_remove_state.html it implies that in version 1.0.2 you still need ERR_remove_thread_state() to clear the current thread; it's just that ERR_remove_state() has been removed.

It's only in 1.1 that ERR_remove_state() is completely deprecated (as it's all handled automatically). 

So to summarise I think your original code was already correct - sorry!
