DESCRIPTION:

MB-54357: Allow to skip select-bucket in cbstats

Recently we have introduced the 'tasks-all' group in cbstats. That
outputs the running tasks for all ready buckets, plus NoBucket.

Given the nature of the command, there is no need to specify any
bucket in the call. But unfortunately the current behaviour in
cbstats is that 'default' is used if the user doesn't provide the
bucket name. The result is that the current cbcollect call like:

  ./cbstats host:port -u user -p password tasks-all

fails by

  No access to bucket:default - permission denied or bucket does not exist.

A possible fix would be removing the 'default' bucket behaviour in
cbstats, but that's likely to break users out there.

Here we introduce the '-n' "no select-bucket" option. When specified
the select-bucket step is skipped. That is currently functional to
tasks-all only, but could be used in the future for anything that needs
to poll the server with no relation to any specific bucket (eg, global
stats, etc..).

cbcollect is being updated in ns_server to pass the new '-n' arg in the
call.
