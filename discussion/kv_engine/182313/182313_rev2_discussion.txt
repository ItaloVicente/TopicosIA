DESCRIPTION:

MB-54357: Allow to skip select-bucket in cbstats

Recently we have introduced the 'tasks-all' group in cbstats. That
outputs the running tasks for all ready buckets, plus NoBucket.
https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/180238 for reference.

Given the nature of the command, there is no need to specify any
bucket in the call. But unfortunately the current behaviour in
cbstats is that 'default' is used if the user doesn't provide the
bucket name. The result is that the current cbcollect call like:

  ./cbstats host:port -u user -p password tasks-all

fails by

  No access to bucket:default - permission denied or bucket does not exist.

A possible fix would be removing the 'default' bucket behaviour in
cbstats, but that's likely to break users out there.

Here we introduce the '-n' "no select-bucket" option. When specified
the select-bucket step is skipped. That is currently functional to
tasks-all only, but could be used in the future for anything that needs
to poll the server with no relation to any specific bucket (eg, global
stats, etc..).

cbcollect is being updated in ns_server to pass the new '-n' arg in the
call.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> No overlap. In that patch Trond touches the inner command execution. While here we essentially allow to skip the select-bucket step for calls that don't require it (as per our offline discussion, imagine you want to call 'cbstats tasks-all' on a node where there's no user-defined bucket, still you want to see the tasks for some other internal "bucket")

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Nod. Just thought I'd highlight it in case you'd not seen it.
Line:129, engines/ep/management/cli_auth_utils.py -> I think a better way to address this would be to simply make this behaviour automatic for the `tasks-all`; given it never makes sense to ask for that stat against any particular bucket.

Note another approach would be to use `mcstat`; which I believe already supports "non-bucket" stats like "connections".

Fine for me, I thought better to avoid hard-coding exceptions for "tasks-all" or whatever other thing that needs a special path (now and in the future).

Yes. Already discussed that with Trond and that's fine. Only difference is that mcstats outputs that "raw" json result while in cbstats we have the table-formatting already implemented.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> In addition it would have made sense to have a unit test for this which would have caught the issue earlier (there is a unit test in testapp_stats.cc which utilize the same methods as mcstat which actually tests that it works without selecting a bucket).
Line:129, engines/ep/management/cli_auth_utils.py -> (there is a bunch of stats which don't require a bucket. Personally I would have dropped the "default-bucket" logic on the client side as we've also dropped the support for "default" bucket on the server side... But I guess support may have an issue with such a change ;))

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Differently from what you mention, the scope of the issue/fix here is entirely within cbstats.py. It is just a wrong 'select-bucket("default")' call that fails, not the STAT processing within KV.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:129, engines/ep/management/cli_auth_utils.py -> Implemented the "make this behaviour automatic for the `tasks-all`" in the latest patchset 👍
