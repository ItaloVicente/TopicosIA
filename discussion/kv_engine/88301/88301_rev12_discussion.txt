DESCRIPTION:

MB-27457: [5/n] Allow KV-engine to set the delete time

1. Update queueDirty so that it assigns a time to all deletions that
don't already have a time assigned (allowing DCP to see the delete
time, not just couchstore).

2. Update couch-kvstore so that it no longer assigns the timestamp
to deletes.

3. Update DCP consumer so that a V2 delete interface is available
enabling the consumer to accept a deleteTime and set it into the item.

4. No change required for DeleteWithMeta, previously all exp were
0 (certainly for XDCR) so couch-kvstore just picks up the incoming
value.

Tests are added covering the DCP consumer API and DeleteWithMeta
showing that both interfaces can set the time when creating a delete.
