DESCRIPTION:

MB-27457: [5/n] Allow KV-engine to set the delete time

1. Update queueDirty so that it assigns a time to all deletions that
don't already have a time assigned (allowing DCP to see the delete
time, not just couchstore).

2. Update couch-kvstore so that it no longer assigns the timestamp
to deletes.

3. Update DCP consumer so that a V2 delete interface is available
enabling the consumer to accept a deleteTime and set it into the item.

4. No change required for DeleteWithMeta, previously all exp were
0 (certainly for XDCR) so couch-kvstore just picks up the incoming
value.

Tests are added which demonstrates that the new DCP API can be used
to override the deleteTime and same for DeleteWithMeta.

Need some more validation on this, I think an expired item passed to queueDirty has a non-zero exptime (which maybe what we wanted...)
