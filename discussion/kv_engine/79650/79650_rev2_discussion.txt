Example usage:

    ./mctrace -u admin -P password "buffer-mode:fixed;buffer-size:200000"

Line:128, programs/mcctl/mcctl.cc -> This is unrelated to the rest of the patch..

Line:170, programs/mctrace/mctrace.cc -> this doesn't play very well on Windows..  Perhaps we should add a method to use sigalarm on windows and have it time out after n seconds? (I vaguely recall tons of problems trying to catch sigint on windows and handle that gracefully)

Line:170, programs/mctrace/mctrace.cc -> It actually doesn't compile on windows since sigaction doesn't exist (I suspect it's `signal` rather than `sigaction` you're thinking of having lots of issues).

The way to do it properly on windows is to use SetConsoleCtrlHandler so I'd need to add something to platform to get this to work.

I think it would probably just be easier to spawn another thread that watches for a newline character on stdin instead of trying to catch sigint.

Line:170, programs/mctrace/mctrace.cc -> Sure :) (but I do think that a -t 60 could come in handy.. sample for a minute and then give me the dump.. I've used those probes in dtrace a lot earlier)

Line:170, programs/mctrace/mctrace.cc -> Good point, I can definitely see that being useful. Apparently SIGALRM is broken on windows too so I guess I'll need a separate thread to do that anyway.

Line:170, programs/mctrace/mctrace.cc -> ARG!

(you could alternatively just use libevent for that libevent)

As for ctrl-c handling.. I don't care too much if windows users _must_ use -t or wait for the buffer to fill up..

(just giving it a -1 to make it easier to see in the overview window that we've added comments that needs to be addressed)

Line:163, programs/mctrace/mctrace.cc -> This probably wants to be conditional, or maybe based on introspecting the current state - my intent is to have tracing started on memcached startup (and logging a minimal set of events) - as such we don't want to stop it (and clear the log?) before dumping it.
