DESCRIPTION:

MB-30552: Move vb id formatting into class Vbid

Create a new class Vbid to initially handle the wrapping of
outputting vb id's in a consistent format, but to develop into
the main type of all vBucket usage.

The class 'Vbid' is located in memcached/vbucket.h in
preperation for future integration of vBucket ID's being
converted to this new type.

Change-Id: Iabc58c9a976bced1a77a1b7a6a77766c9c5019bd
