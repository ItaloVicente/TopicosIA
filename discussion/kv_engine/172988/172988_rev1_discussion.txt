DESCRIPTION:

MB-51606: Don't throw if PDM of dead vBucket tries to ack

We need to notifyPersistence to the DM of dead vBuckets to ensure
that the HPS is moved appropriately so that if the vBucket is
set to replica then it acks back a correct value to the active.
Dead vBuckets should not be allowed to ack and currently they throw
and assertion if they try to. Modify the function to ignore the
attempted ack for dead vBuckets rather than throw.

Line:1072, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Worth to mention why here, eg "dead vbuckets shouldn't be acking, active might reveive unexpected acks and fail by that otherwise"

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1072, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Updated, sort of. If the active received an ack from this vBucket it would just store it in queuedSeqnoAcks which would get cleaned up on connection drop so it should actually be benign
