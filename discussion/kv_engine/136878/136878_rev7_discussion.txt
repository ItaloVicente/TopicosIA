DESCRIPTION:

MB-41321: Defer collection statistic updates until successful commit

Collection statistics (items, disk size and persistent high-seqno) for
persistent buckets are managed by the flusher thread.  This is done
because we maintain statistic documents in KVStore (e.g. _local
documents), and as the flusher writes documents to KVStore, we can count
and update these statistic documents along with the documents. Warmup
for example can open a KVStore and know the count and size of all
collections just by reading the statistic documents.

Prior to this change the visible collection statistics were updated by
callbacks invoked by the KVStore before 'commit'. So cmd_stat etc... are
reading counters that are written to from the flusher - if the KVStore
update fails the flusher retries the batch of items, which means that
the counters are  updated multiple times, giving the wrong counters or
in-case of deletes underflow exceptions.

As part of this fix it was also identified that the collections flusher
code (collections/flush.cc) made decisions about documents in the
flush batch and documents already stored on disk by querying the
VB::Manifest object. This is a flawed approach because the VB::Manifest
contains changes that are not yet 'durable', i.e. we may update the
statistics on disk based on the VB::Manifest saying a collection was
dropped, but that drop is somewhere in a yet-to-be persisted
checkpoint - warm-up and that collection drop redacts but it's too late
for the statistic updates, the values could now be wrong.

This commit changes how collection statistics are updated to occur in
multiple steps.

1) As the items of the batch are processed, we now update a flusher
owned map of collection-ID to collection statistics - this collects
the 'deltas' of changes being made by the flusher batch.

2) Before commit we read the current collection statistics and apply
the collected changes to generate statistics for the '_local' updates.

3) If the commit is successful, we update the current in-memory
statistics.

As part of these steps the changes to collection persisted statistics
now don't use the VB::Manifest 'map' of what are current collections,
except for the final 'make visible' write. The functions doing the
updates now make decisions about dropped collections based on the
current flush data, which knows if collections were dropped in the batch
(and the sequence number of the drop), and secondly (for existing items
in the document update case) what collections have already been dropped
in the KVStore we are  updating.

Finally to allow for the flusher to make changes to a collection's
statistics and avoid a cycle of "read statistics, update, write
statistics" the VB::Manifest is modified so that it doesn't immediately
discard the count/size/seqno of dropped collections. This allows the
flusher to just do 'update and write' (which is what it has always done
for collections).
