DESCRIPTION:

MB-23086: Move Bucket::Type to independent BucketType

Subsequent changes for this MB want to use Bucket::Type when requesting
new buckets via functions in enginemap. With the Type being owned by
Bucket (bucket.h) a number of unnecessary dependencies would need to be
met for those enginemap users just to reference Bucket::Type, moving
this type removes those dependencies.
