DESCRIPTION:

MB-52682: Allow an Item's freqCounterValue to be left unspecified

We want to be able to use the per-vBucket MFU histograms to choose the
starting MFU values for items stored in the HashTable.

To do that, we need to be able to distinguish between Items for which we
have explicitly set this value (like for items received over DCP) vs
items coming in from the front-end.

Make the freqCounterValue accessors use std::optional to distingush
between those two cases.
