DESCRIPTION:

Move Mock{Ep,Ephemeral}Bucket defns to .cc

Move the definitions of methods in classes Mock{Ep,Ephemeral}Bucket
into new .cc files. This minimises the headers needed in the .h files;
in turn reducing the number of other headers pulled in by users of the
Mock classes.

Also create a new Object Library to group the various mock_XXX.cc
files, so we don't have to specify the individual source files
multiple times when used by different programs.
