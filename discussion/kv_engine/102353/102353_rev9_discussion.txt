DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Track when pending SyncWrites should be committed

This is the first real implementation of Durability Requirement (DR)
verification in the DurabilityMonitor.
In its first implememtation, the DurabilityMonitor has very simple
internal structures that support only 1 replica. That makes the DR
verification very simple.
That is why this patch follows the change where I prepare the internal
structures for multiple replicas.
Note that multiple-replicas as DurabilityMonitor feature remains
unsupported though.

Line:227, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> consider emplace_back for maximum performance.

Line:236, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Consider using a heap / std::priority_queue instead as you can build it in-order.

Line:149, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Not sure I understand the need for this. Note there cannot in the general case be a single committed iterator; as different durability levels can result in pending SyncWrites committing in a different order to what they were added in (i.e. not necessarily in seqno order).

Line:149, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> There is only 1 commit iterator here, I'll add the second for tracking the committed disk seqno.

But why tracking commits with an iterator?
That's because the DurabilityMonitor stores SyncWrites in a Container, and I'm not yet sure if removing items from the Container can be done synchronously with 'commit' for performance reason.
So I'm considering the following general case:

C = iterator tracking 
Ri = iterator tracking Replica i

Container:    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
                        ^         ^         ^         ^
                        C         R1        R2        R3

If we consider a BGTask doing the item-removal, then in general items in [Container::begin, C] are eligible for removing.

In the presence of both Cm (memory) and Cd (disk), the items eligible for removing are in [Container::begin, Cd] (as min(Cm, Cd) should always return Cd by design).

Also, currently I have implemented a logic where the items eligible for commit are in [C+1, R*], with R* determined by the DurabilityRequirement.

If we consider the case of a synchronous items removal (i.e., we remove items as soon as we commit them), then the items eligible for commit will be always in [Container::begin, R*], so we don't need to track commits.

Line:149, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> I'd suggest doing it "synchronously" for now (note that actually that's probably going to be a non-frontend thread anyway as I think that processing dcp_seqno_ack / calling VBucket::commit() should be done on a background thread anyways.

Line:149, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> My model requires to track commits anyway (in some way, whether it is an iterator or anything else) when I introduce support for PersistTo (WIP patch at http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/102588)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:149, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> As agreed, deferring the following to follow-up patches:

1) Extending and validating the current model by adding support for PersistTo and multiple Replication Chain. Note that for the latter I am in an open discussion with ns_server for understanding what are the legal Replication Chain updates.

2) Commited SyncSwrite removal
