DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Track when pending SyncWrites should be committed

This is the first real implementation of Durability Requirement (DR)
verification in the DurabilityMonitor.
In its first implememtation, the DurabilityMonitor has very simple
internal structures that support only 1 replica. That makes the DR
verification very simple.
That is why this patch follows the change where I prepare the internal
structures for multiple replicas.
Note that multiple-replicas as DurabilityMonitor feature remains
unsupported though.
