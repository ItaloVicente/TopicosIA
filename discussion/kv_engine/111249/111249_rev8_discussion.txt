DESCRIPTION:

MB-34682: Allow abort without prepare if receiving disk snapshot

The previous attempt to allow aborts without a prepare limited the
valid window for this to aborts with a prepare seqno less than the
first seqno seen after stream resumption. This fails to account for
aborts overwriting prepares on disk so we will never see a prepare
in a disk snapshot if we will also see an abort.

Instead, we should just allow (and ignore) an abort without a prepare
if we are receiving a disk snapshot and the prepare seqno of the
abort is greater than or equal to the snapshot start; it should never
be less because we should have previously received it.
