DESCRIPTION:

MB-32779: Make "test producer disk backfill limits" single threaded

The test checks the number of backfill task runs we perform for
both persistent and ephemeral buckets when streaming via DCP. The
scan buffer is set to a very small size to attempt to force each
backfill task run to run once. This can exhibit a sporadic failure
if a stepping producer drains the ready queue (and scan buffer)
between items processed by the backfill task. This can cause us to
run fewer backfills and return the same number of items.

Make "test producer disk backfill limits" single threaded to remove
the chance of hitting this race condition. We can verify in a
similar test how many backfills are run by running them manually.
