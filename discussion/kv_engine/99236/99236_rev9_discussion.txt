DESCRIPTION:

MB-30913: Add Scopes to bucket level Manifest

Add Scopes to the Manifest class.

The Manifest class should parse json strings in the format:
"{"uid" : "0",
  "scopes":[
     {"name":"_default",
      "uid":"0",
      "collections":[
         {"name":"_default", "uid":"0"},
         {"name":"meat", "uid":"3"}]
     },
     {"name":"brewerA",
      "uid":"2",
      "collections":[
         {"name":"beer", "uid":"4"}]
     }]
}"

Many more examples of valid and invalid manifests can be found
in the file
"engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/manifest_test.cc".

The Manifest class should store two maps:

1) A map of ScopeID to Scope.
2) A map of CollectionID to collection name.

A Scope object will store a scope name, which allows us to find a
collection by name (required in future), and a vector of associated
CollectionID's. The collections vector within a Scope allows us to:

1) Iterate on collections from a Scope context, so we can pull out
a ScopeID for a collection.
2) Quickly get all collections associated with a scope for dropping.

This also requires modification of the test manifest class to add
collections into the default scope, and to output a json string
including scopes. Full scope functionality should also be added to
the test manifest class for more thorough testing.
