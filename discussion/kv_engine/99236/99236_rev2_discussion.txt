DESCRIPTION:

MB-30913: Add Scopes to manifest

Add Scopes to the Manifest class. This requires modification of
the test manifest class to add collections into the default scope,
and to output a json string including scopes. VBucket Manifest
also requires modification to be able to parse all collections in
a manifest, as opposed to just those in the first scope.
