DESCRIPTION:

MB-30913: Add Scopes to manifest

Add Scopes to the Manifest class. This requires modification of
the test manifest class to add collections into the default scope,
and to output a json string including scopes. VBucket Manifest
also requires modification to be able to parse all collections in
a manifest, as opposed to just those in the first scope.

Line:64, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.cc -> Additionally, create a ScopeID type, it can just be 
   
    using ScopeID = CollectionID

Line:64, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.cc -> We should create a makeScopeID method, which for now can just call makeCollectionID, it will make it easier for us to change if we need to.

Line:77, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.cc -> This error case should be every collection across all scopes, so if max is 1000 and I have two scopes with 501 collections in each, I should hit a failure, but this will allow it through.

We should make sure there's a test case for it, set max to a low number  and ensure that the if total count of collections (from many scopes) exceeds max, we get an error

Line:111, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.cc -> we can probably do the max collections test here just by checking the size of the collections map

Line:132, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.cc -> We also need to track if the default scope was found and error if not.

Line:169, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.h -> In the near future we need to add a new memcached collections command which will allow a user to get the CollectionID of a collection (by-name). With scopes added, the command needs work as follows:

get_collection_id("scope.collection") 

E.g. if a I have config (not valid JSON)  - "scope":"us_west",... "collections":[{"users":"555"}...]

get_collection_id("us_west.users") returns 555

With the data structures here, the scope name is not recorded so we can't do lookups by-name. Suggest we think about the best way to 

1) Have a data structure that VB::Manifest can consume (so we can create/drop collections but also know the scope-ID)
2) Provide scope.collection lookups

Line:36, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> The JSON manifest passed here will only ever be the one we store in the vbucket couchfile

Line:71, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> This should never happen, the only object to see the "set_collections" JSON data is Collections::Manifest.

Collections::VB::Manifest is only ever constructed from the persisted vbucket JSON, which at this patch level never has scopes in it.

Line:111, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.cc -> I've just expanded the original check so we don't have to process any collections in the scope if we know it would push size > max size and only make the check once

Line:132, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.cc -> This check does this (count with id of 0), which this test fails manifest_test.cc:44

           // valid uid, no default scope
            R"({"uid" : "0",
                "scopes":[{"name":"not_the_default", "uid":"2",
                "collections":[]}]})",

For clarity I will rename CollectionID::DefaultCollection to CollectionID::Default so that the check can instead be written as

"if (this->scopes.count(ScopeID::Default) == 0) {"...

Line:169, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.h -> 1) Per our chat earlier, going to add a ScopeID to serialised manifest/entry and manifest entry for VB::Manifest in a different patch set
2) Scope name is recorded (manifest.h:46), added this method now as it is simple, along with test cases. Could make the structure more hierarchical, currently we only use the ability to iterate on collections in VB::processManifest and a couple of test cases, but it seems like useful functionality to keep

Line:36, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Oops, just got a bit confused. Reverted the changes to these files. The refactoring can be done in a future patch when we change serialised manifests
