DESCRIPTION:

MB-44168: Clean up partially created files during startup

Creating a new vbucket data file isn't an atomic operation.
First couchstore creates the file, then it writes an empty header
before we write the local document and commit.

If a crash occurs in the timeslot from the file is created until
the header is written we'll end up in an endless loop where
ns_server tries to create the bucket and we refuse to create the
bucket as the file has no headers.

couch-kvstore don't really know when its about to write to a file
for the first time (there isn't a "create empty vbucket" call,
instead the file is automatically created by a write vbstate
call if the file isn't there (by adding O_CREATE, but we don't
add O_EXCL so we won't fail if the file already exists). To
avoid having to check for the file existence as part of every
time we want to open the file (to see if we should open as a
temporary file and finally do rename when we're done) it seems
like a better idea to just extend the startup code to clean up
after such errors.
