DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] MB-52580: Remove keyIndexKeyAllocator

Remove the keyIndexKeyAllocator as there is no equivalent
for the manually tracked stats, and we want to keep them in line with
each other.
Note: it is still kept behind the scenes, just the getter is removed and
its value is only available as part of keyIndexAllocator's total.

Convert the test "keyIndexAllocatorsAreDisjoint" to
"keyIndexAllocaatorAccountsForKey" to test the new behaviour.
