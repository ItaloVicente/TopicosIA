DESCRIPTION:

MB-52580: Remove keyIndexKeyAllocator

The memory allocation for the keys in the keyIndex is already tracked by
the keyIndex allocator, so the keyIndexKeyAllocator is not needed. This
also keeps the allocator stats in line with the manually tracked ones
- there is no key-only manually tracked stat for the key index.
