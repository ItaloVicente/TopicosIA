DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Stop and cancel a RangeScan when disconnected during a scan

Prior to this commit, if a client disconnects after a continue request
the RangeScanContinueTask has no mechanism to break the scan, it could
"spin" and progress the iterator for some time.

This commit adds a disconnected detection path from the
Cookie::sendResponse function which the scan loop is using to push
data to the connection. If a disconnection is detected the policy
is to cancel the RangeScan as the iterator may have been progressed
forwards and the client has no way to correctly resume the scan.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Had looked at using "handleDisconnect" but that requires a whole new cookie->range-can mapping to be maintained - this method seems a lot simpler.

Line:650, daemon/connection.h -> worth documenting the return value

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:650, daemon/connection.h -> Ack

May flip the logic as at the moment true == disconnected or "sendResponse failed" which seems like the wrong use of true?
