DESCRIPTION:

MB-47267: Make backfill during warmup a PauseResume task

MB-47267 demonstrated that during warmup of a node in a cluster which
has multiple buckets of different sizes, smaller buckets could become
stuck behind larger buckets causing their warmup time to be much longer
than it need be. This can causes problems during delta node recovery as
NS_Server starts requesting vbucket stats to check vbucket state and
if this is not responded to promptly this will cause the rebalance to
timeout. Which may happen as EP-Engine does not service any vbucket
stats requests till we've completed 'PopulateVBucketMap' state of
warmup, which requires  one + five x the number of shards reader tasks
to have been run and completed. Though these tasks are relatively quick
to run, they can become stuck behind other bucket's warmup backfilling
tasks which can take upwards of minutes to run depending on the size of
the bucket. As they share the same reader thread task pool.

To fix this, this patch modifies the backfilling functionality during
warmup so that backfill may now be paused after a time deadline has
been met and store the seqno we've reached so that we can start
backfilling again when the tasks is rescheduled. Which in turn allows
the faster initial phases of warmup to have a chance of being run
between each run of backfill.  This patch unifies the functionality
of the backfilling stages of warmup so that the same code is used for
'KeyDump', 'LoadingKVPairs' and 'LoadingData' stages of warmup.

This patch also adds a test to ensure that, if we create a larger
bucket, and start warmup it up before a smaller one. With only one
reader thread that the smaller bucket is able to warmup before that
the larger one has finished warming up.

A ep_perfsuite test has been added to test warmup latency to help with
tuning of the maxDuration time for that a backfill can take before it's
paused.

Line:2774, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I don't think it's a good idea to map multiple engine_err values to the same return value - that results in ambiguity. 

I was thinking we already had multiple COUCHSTORE_ERROR.xxx values for different cases, but seems like "ERROR_CANCEL" is just "callback wanted to cancel it for some reason.

I suggest what you do instead is record the fact the callback decided to stop the scan in the callback's state itself (but continue to just return no_memory), then have the warmup code check the status code the callback record and make the decision on what do do next from that (stop due to OOM or yield and reschedule if told to pause).

Line:418, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Is that true on an environment where the items are not already in buffer cache / don't have a fast NVMe disk?

10 microseconds to load an item from disk is /fast/; I think even a fast NVMe might struggle to do all the necessary syscalls etc / B-tree walk to get that speed; and an SSD / EBS disk will be much slower.

What happens to warmup speed if you yield after every item (and assuming the couchstore files are not already in buffer cache)?

Line:1595, engines/ep/tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Performing multiple warmups is just going to end up measuring the performance of the OS buffer cache.

What you really need to do is create the files, flush them from the buffer cache and then warmup. If you want multiple iterations you need to flush from buffer cache on every iteration.

That's a little tricky to do targeted at single files; you could do something as a blunt instrument by writing to `/proc/sys/vm/drop_caches` but that affects the entire machine (and requires root).

For now you could just split this benchmark into two - one to create the files, the second to actually warmup; then manually just drop caches before running just the second bench.

Line:8302, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> 1ms != 9ms - could you expand the comment please?
