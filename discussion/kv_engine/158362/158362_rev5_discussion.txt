DESCRIPTION:

MB-47267: Make backfill during warmup a PauseResume task

MB-47267 demonstrated that during warmup of a node in a cluster which has
multiple buckets of different sizes. Smaller buckets could become stuck behind
larger buckets during warmup. This causes problems during delta node recovery
as NS_Server starts requesting vbucket stats to check vbucket state. However,
if this is not responded to promptly this will cause the rebalance to timeout.

This is due to KV not servicing any vbucket stats requests till we've
completed 'PopulateVBucketMap' state of warmup, which requires one + five x
the number of shards reader tasks to have been run and completed. Though
these tasks are relatively quick to run, they can become stuck behind other
bucket's warmup backfilling tasks which can take upwards of minutes to run
depending on the size of the bucket. As they share the same reader thread
task pool.

To fix this, this patch modified the backfilling functionality during warmup
so that backfill may now be paused after a time deadline has been met. Which
intern allows the faster initial phases of warmup to have a chance of being
run and we've also dropped the priority of these tasks to help the scheduler
pick them up first. This patch has also unified the functionality of the
backfilling stages of warmup so they share the same code for 'KeyDump',
'LoadingKVPairs' and 'LoadingData' stages of warmup.

This patch also adds a test to ensure that, if we create a larger bucket,
and start warmup it up before a smaller one. With only one reader thread
that the smaller bucket is able to warmup before that the larger one has
finished warming up.
