DESCRIPTION:

MB-47267: Make backfill during warmup a PauseResume task

MB-47267 demonstrated that during warmup of a node in a cluster which
has multiple buckets of different sizes. Smaller buckets could become
stuck behind larger buckets causing their warmup time to be much longer
than it need be. This can causes problems during delta node recovery as
NS_Server starts requesting vbucket stats to check vbucket state and
if this is not responded to promptly this will cause the rebalance to
timeout. Which may happen as EP-Engine does not service any vbucket
stats requests till we've completed 'PopulateVBucketMap' state of
warmup, which requires  one + five x the number of shards reader tasks
to have been run and completed. Though these tasks are relatively quick
to run, they can become stuck behind other bucket's warmup backfilling
tasks which can take upwards of minutes to run depending on the size of
the bucket. As they share the same reader thread task pool.

To fix this, this patch modifies the backfilling functionality during
warmup so that backfill may now be paused after a time deadline has
been met and store the seqno we've reached so that we can start
backfilling again when the tasks is rescheduled. Which intern allows
the faster initial phases of warmup to have a chance of being run
between each run of backfill. We've also dropped the priority of these
tasks to help the scheduler pick up the faster initial tasks first.
This patch has unifies the functionality of the backfilling stages of
warmup so that the same code is used for 'KeyDump', 'LoadingKVPairs'
and 'LoadingData' stages of warmup.

This patch also adds a test to ensure that, if we create a larger
bucket, and start warmup it up before a smaller one. With only one
reader thread that the smaller bucket is able to warmup before that
the larger one has finished warming up.

I think the basic structure looks good - just a few suggestions on implementation details.
Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> "... of different sizes." - This sentence ends somewhat abruptly - I think you want to combine it with the following sentence with a comma.

Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> "intern" -> "in turn"

Line:29, /COMMIT_MSG -> Note we don't currently implement priorities in FollyExecutorPool so this will have no effect.

Line:34, engines/ep/src/tasks.def.h -> I don't think this rename is worthwhile - the actual task _purpose_ hasn't changed, only it's implementation; as such I don't think it's worth renaming them.

Line:2511, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Please document why this is atomic.

Line:1418, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Please document this new class.

Line:1435, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Ditto

Line:1438, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> 'sh' is pretty ambiguously named, prefer shardId or similar.

Line:1439, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Can this be null? If not prefer a reference.

Line:1440, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Why do we need shardId _and_ a vBucket filter? I would have thought we calculate the filter from the shard id within the class itself?

Line:1461, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Sure, but aren't you pausing it after some interval? (maxExpectedDuration is the maximum duration of a single run).

Line:1471, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Style: Prefer an early return here (invert the logic) to reduce the indentation in your code.

Line:1473, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Any reason to not just create this in the ctor - then we don't need to check it exists etc - and you probably don't need a unique_ptr for it.

Line:1532, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> I feel like using the same class for a few different phases in warmup (and then switching behaviour via if() is potentially confusing. Prefer to just have a common base-class with subclasses for the actual different phases, with appropriate virtual methods where the behaviour differs.

Line:1549, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> I don't think we should be creating the scan context every time we (re)visit a single vBucket - just create it once for each vBucket; call scan() and then pause the scan when we reach the limit; next time we wake up and visit the same bucket we just call scan() again.

Line:1612, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Is that true? Don't we require all tasks of a given class to have completed (where we decrement the backfillTasks count) before we advance to the next state?

Line:1618, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Why would this case occur? I would have thought we will always schedule one task per shard?

Line:8265, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Pretty sure the config management just uses the last value of a particular config key-value pair, so you can just append the particular couch_bucket and dbname you want to the end.

Line:8269, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please document this test.

Line:8272, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Do we need to have such a large number of keys / vBuckets? Under things like ASan / TSan this may run very slowly.

Can we achieve the same effect with a smaller dataset?

Line:32, engines/ep/src/tasks.def.h -> This could take almost as long LoadingKVPairs/LoadingData if we are looking at a relica with an incomplete disk checkpoint. Might be worth making this pausable too.

So yes, I do think we need to also make this task pausable - but let's do it as a second patch and focus on the tasks you are already fixing in this patch.

Line:32, engines/ep/src/tasks.def.h -> In theory LoadPreparedSyncWrites could be large - up to whatever prepares we can prepare in 60s or so). However in practice I suspect is will be short - perhaps a few seconds per vBucket. @Ben does that match your experience / expectations?

As a first step you could just ensure we yield the task after each vBucket - I suspect that should be reasonably straightforward and probably get 80% of the benefit. Either way it can be in a second patch.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:32, engines/ep/src/tasks.def.h -> Think this raises an interesting point. Though I have two points hesitation against adding it to this patch:
1. The majority of loading of prepares is handled by EPBucket::loadPreparedSyncWrites() so there's quite a bit of re-factoring required to make make it a pause/resume backfill and I don't think we can use the same backfill class I've created without some changes to allow it to update the durability seqnos.
2. The 'LoadPreparedSyncWrites' phase of warmup must be completed before we enable stats, so in the normal case we want this to complete as fast as possible. 

For us to be warming up an incomplete disk checkpoint we would have to have been shutdown while streaming a replica disk checkpoint right? Just wandering how common of a case we think this would be? 

Not sure what you're opinion on this is @DaveR and @Ben?

Line:32, engines/ep/src/tasks.def.h -> In the case where we have a replica with a partial disk checkpoint/backfill we iterate the entire snapshot which could be substantially more than 60s worth of prepares. In general it should be short though.

This patch flips it on its head so that we transition() when threadtask_count == 0. Which is why I need to add all this code. I'll revert it and keep it a similar style as before.
