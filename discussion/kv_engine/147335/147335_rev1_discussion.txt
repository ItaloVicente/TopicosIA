DESCRIPTION:

MB-44534: Sanitize datatype for empty payloads at VBucket::queueDirty

If an external component tries to store an empty item with
(datatype != raw), then we reset datatype:raw.

Note that we do that at VBucket::queueDirty, which is the "store" code
path used by all MCBP and DCP commands.

Also, we sanitize the datatype for the StoredValue in the HashTable and
the item in Checkpoint, which means preventing the invalid datatype from
being stored in memory and disk.
