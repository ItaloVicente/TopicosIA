DESCRIPTION:

MB-44010: Unit tests for concurrent backfill & vBucket delete

Unit tests for checking behvaviour of a concurrent backfill and
vBucket delete.

1. Existing DCP test (BackfillDeletedVBucket) covered most of this
   scenario, but cruciually didn't actually trigger the background
   task call KVStore::delVBucket. This patch expands it actually call
   KVStore::delVBucket.

   When run under Magma this test now hangs (like the original system
   test scenario).

2. Add a KVStore test which starts a scan, then halfway though deletes
   the vBucket. For Couchstore and RocksDB the delete is non-blocking,
   for Magma the test hangs.

Note that Couchstore and RocksDB behave differently here:

- Couchstore allows the scan to run to completion (as each vbucket is
  a single file and the scan still has an FD open even though the
  inode has been unlinked).

- RocksDB aborts the scan as the underlying VBucket column family has
  been removed.

Either behavour is acceptable for Magma, just as long as it doesn't
hang.
