DESCRIPTION:

MB-44010: Unit tests for concurrent backfill & vBucket delete

Unit tests for checking behvaviour of a concurrent backfill and
vBucket delete.

1. Existing DCP test (BackfillDeletedVBucket) covered most of this
   scenario, but crucially didn't actually trigger the background task
   call KVStore::delVBucket. This patch expands it actually call
   KVStore::delVBucket.

   When run under Magma prior to Magma commit "MB-44010 magma: Make
   DestoryKVStore API non-blocking" (0281c9e) test hangs (like the
   original system test scenario).

2. Add a KVStore test which starts a scan, then halfway though deletes
   the vBucket. For Couchstore and RocksDB the delete is non-blocking,
   for Magma the test hangs.

Note that Couchstore and RocksDB behave differently here:

- Couchstore allows the scan to run to completion (as each vbucket is
  a single file and the scan still has an FD open even though the
  inode has been unlinked).

- RocksDB aborts the scan as the underlying VBucket column family has
  been removed.

Either behavour is acceptable, just as long as it doesn't hang.
