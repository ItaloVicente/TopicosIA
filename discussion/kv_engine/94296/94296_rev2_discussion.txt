DESCRIPTION:

MB-29675: Only wakeup ckpt remover if removable checkpoints

Currently we wake up the ClosedUnrefCheckpointRemoverTask in two
places, based on if there is more than one checkpoint in existence:

a) flusheVBucket()
b) ActiveStream::getOutstandingItems

However, this is a optimistic check - just because there is more than
one checkpoint; doesn't mean that any checkpoints can actually be
freed. There is typically at least two cursors (persistence +
replication), and potentially many more.

As such this will cause us to schedule and run
ClosedUnrefCheckpointRemoverTask unnecessarily.

Change the wakeup criteria to be based on if the oldest checkpoint
(which is the first one which can be considered to be removed) is both
closed, and has zero cursors in it.
