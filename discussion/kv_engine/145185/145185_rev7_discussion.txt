DESCRIPTION:

MB-42224: Fail the node if persistence repeatedly fails header's sync

At http://review.couchbase.org/c/couchstore/+/145098 we allow couchstore
to auto-retry header's persistence if it fails at fsync.

This patch triggers auto-retry in EPBucket::flushVBucket path. Also, EP
increments ep_data_write_failed at each failure, which triggers
ns_server's auto-failover if the user has enabled it.
