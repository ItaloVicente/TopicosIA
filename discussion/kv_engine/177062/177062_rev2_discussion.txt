DESCRIPTION:

MB-46738: Turn FCManager::consumersMap into a folly::Sync set

Two changes here:
1. From mutex to folly::Synchronized, for easier thread safety
2. From map<Cookie, DcpConsumer*> to set<DcpConsumer*>

(2) is all what we need for modifying/accessing the structure as all
the related FCManager API takes DcpConsumer* in input.
