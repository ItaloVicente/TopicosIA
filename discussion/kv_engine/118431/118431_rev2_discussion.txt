DESCRIPTION:

MB-36985: Fix test failures due to shard change

With the change to shard scaling by CPU we are now using more memory
out of the box on a system with a large number of CPUs. This is
causing issues with some memory sensitive tests. Drop the number of
shards back to 4 for these tests.

Some tests also specify a number of vBuckets. This must be greater
than the number of shards or tests will fail. Drop the number of
shards back to 4 for these tests.

Cheers Scott, will take another look!

Suggest flipping this over to mad-hatter branch (and then forward-merging) given the default shard change is also in there (and well be supporting mad-hatter branch for quite a while).

Note that given this patch only touches test code, that's fine from a code control pov - although you might want to flip the MB over to the one which actually changed the number of shards.

Fixed the rocksdb xdcr tests by bumping the timeout to 120 seconds, they just appear to be running slower now. Did not fix the magma ENOMEM issue as not necessary for MH and non-magma variants don't hit it. Should be a trivial fix for you Scott by dropping default shard count or bumping memory quota.
