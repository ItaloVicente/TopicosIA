DESCRIPTION:

MB-47267: Use RO KVStore for Warmup

Prior to "Recommit: MB-47267: Make backfill during warmup a
PauseResume task" (423ad543e), Warmup used the read-only KVStore for
backfilling phases - it doesn't need to modify anything during such
phases.

This was inadvertently changed to the read-write store during adding
pause/resume support. Revert back to read-only.
