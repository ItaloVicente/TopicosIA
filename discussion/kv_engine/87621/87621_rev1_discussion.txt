DESCRIPTION:

MB-27419: Support off/passive/active compression modes

KV-engine needs to support 3 different modes for compression

(i) Off: Data that is stored in the hash table will be stored
         as uncompressed
(ii) Passive: Data that is stored in the hash table will be
              stored as is
(iii) Active: KV-engine will actively try to compress the
              documents stored in the hash table
