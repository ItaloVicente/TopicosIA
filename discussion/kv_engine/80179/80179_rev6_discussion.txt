DESCRIPTION:

MB-21682: Close producer streams upon vBucket rollback

When a replica vBucket is required to rollback to be consistent with the
active, we must close all DCP producer streams from the replica. The
client can then re-open the stream, and can then itself rollback.

Line:248, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> This shouldn't be required - see comments on test

Line:1799, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Consider moving this test to one of the single threaded variants, then there should be no need to block other tasks like this. E.g. look at test_mb20751_deadlock_on_disconnect_delete which uses mock dcp and the single executor thread model

Line:1806, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Can you change this to use MockDcpProducer? You should then be able to revert the change in producer.h (i.e. exposing findStream)

Line:1799, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Aye will do

Line:1806, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> I'd like to - moving findStream came out of looking for a minimal change to make the test do-able. I considered:

- Alter connMap to allow manually adding a producer, then add a mock producer

- Alter connMap.newProducer to allow specifying what kind of producer to make e.g, break the actual construction out into a virtual method or use templatey magics or w/e

- Use a MockDcpConnMap, do one of the above to that to allow adding a MockProducer, and stick it into the KVBucket in some way.

Or it is very likely there is a nicer way that I haven't spotted and I'm over complicating things - thoughts are welcome :P

Line:1806, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> a mock dcpconnmap would need inserting into the engine sorry, and once it's a synchronous test it will be  a SynchronousEPEngine, which could be modified - trying this :P
