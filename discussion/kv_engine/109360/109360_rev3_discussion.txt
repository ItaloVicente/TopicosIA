DESCRIPTION:

MB-34228: Fix deadlock for SyncWrite with Replicas=0

There exists a deadlock issue for SyncWrites when Replicas=0 where
we attempt to acquire the HashBucketLock again whilst we already have
it acquired. This is because we attempt to immediately commit a
SyncWrite if it is satisfied.

Update the ADM::addSyncWrite function to not attempt to commit the
SyncWrite immediately. Instead, we will commit the SyncWrite at the
end of the VBucket::set et al functions after we no longer need the
HashBucketLock (although we will re-acquire the HashBucketLock if
we commit).

Add a test for SyncWrite with Replicas=0.

Change-Id: Ied14a712bf735ad9b0f93955e0e336e6dd50080f

Line:71, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Probably I'm missing the point: can't we just keep a single addSyncWrite() function where:
1) we solve the non-auto-generated seqno issues by CM::createSnapshot() (line 90)
2) we call set() in place of processSet() ?

Line:71, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Also, about this approach: that's fine for placing a SyncWrite to a specific seqno, but in general we may want to test cases where we have a mix of SyncWrite and normal mutations, and other cases where we have only SyncWrites (which is why I've chosen the other approach time ago).

Line:71, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> As discussed in person

1) Yes, but that only works if you can give a queueItmCtx set to not generate a new seqno (which you can't if you want to call VBucket::set) so it's not valid to do this at active

2) We can't call set for non-active vBuckets because it requires an activeDM (for checking that durability is possible and to call checkForCommit)

Line:1777, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> will do

Line:71, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Agreed to keep this for now.

Just for reference: in case we need to change it in the future, we'll probably need to set the CheckpointManager so that the snapshot-boundaries in the open checkpoint allow to queueing the seqno in input (which is the active-equivalent of the approach used for replica at line 90 below).
Very likely the CM will return seqno/range errors otherwise.
