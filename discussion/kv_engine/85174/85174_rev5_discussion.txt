DESCRIPTION:

MB-26594 [RocksDB] Allow to size the Block Cache

This change introduces the new 'rocksdb_block_cache_size' configuration
parameter to size the Block Cache. The new parameter represents the
total size of the Block Cache for all the VBuckets managed by the node.
A value of '0' keeps the size of the Block Cache to the default.
