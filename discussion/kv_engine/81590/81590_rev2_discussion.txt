Line:2277, daemon/memcached.cc -> Do we want to add an explicit predicate to the wait so the sleep continues if we're woken early? Maybe eval bucket.clients?

Line:2277, daemon/memcached.cc -> The reason I just had a timed sleep here was so that we could "monitor" the progress in the log file by having it dumping the number of clients still connected... The condition variable is only signalled when the last client disconnects from the bucket..

Yes this is a bit racy, but it'll only sleep up to a second (if the last connection disconnect after we've checked the number of clients) and we go to sleep... but it'll only be a sec for a bucket deletion which normally takes much longer.
