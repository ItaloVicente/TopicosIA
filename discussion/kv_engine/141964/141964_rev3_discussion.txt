DESCRIPTION:

MB-43242: Don't override the purge_before_ts if already set

KV is ignoring any value that comes in from the compaction
command and forcing the purge_before_ts to be in the past.

This makes it stops running of arbitrary compactions which
are useful to fix certain field issues without downtime.
