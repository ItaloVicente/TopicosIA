DESCRIPTION:

MB-24423: Simplify memory fragmentation calculation

Active Bytes is a multiple of mem pages containing the app's used
mem. Allocated Bytes is what mc/ep explicitly request to be allocated.
We now define frag=active-allocated. This will include other overheads
associated with the allocator. Also added resident and retained memory stats.

Line:151, daemon/alloc_hooks_jemalloc.cc -> I think we should also get rid of free_mapped - it was only added to try and give compatibility with TCMalloc, but I'm suspicious of how accurate it actually is here.

Given we are no longer trying to match TCMalloc (it's not used), I think we drop this and just expose the top-level jemalloc stats (allocated, active, metadata, resident, mapped, retained) - which I think you have most of now.

Line:151, daemon/alloc_hooks_jemalloc.cc -> Mebbe we can change the stats structure into map of string->uint64 to support as many stats as possible, it would make it simpler to add stats in the future too .

Line:151, daemon/alloc_hooks_jemalloc.cc -> Not sure there's much value to that: 

- the set of memory stats are fixed, so there's no need for a dynamic associative array.
- In doing so we'd loose static checking 
- It'll be slower (although it's probably not performance-sensitive code)
- We rarely add new stats here (I don't think we've changed for 2 years) - and even when we do we need to update documentation etc, so actually having a fixed list is arguably better.
