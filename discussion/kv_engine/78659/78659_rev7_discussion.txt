DESCRIPTION:

MB-24423: Simplify memory fragmentation calculation

Active Bytes is a multiple of mem pages containing the app's used
mem. Allocated Bytes is what mc/ep explicitly request to be allocated.
We now define frag=active-allocated. This will include other overheads
associated with the allocator. Also added resident and retained memory stats.
