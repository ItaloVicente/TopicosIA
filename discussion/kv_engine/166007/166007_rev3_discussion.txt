DESCRIPTION:

MB-49594: Reset cursor distance in CM::resetCursors

The cursor distance might be corrupted otherwise, which would make a
bunch of possible cascade issues:
1. Wrong distance passed to boost::list::splice(range, distance) at
   ItemExpel -> The side effect would be corrupting the internal
   tracked container size, with undefined behaviour at that point
2. Wrong distance used when computing some checkpoint stats -> That
   might underflow non-negative counters, which would also crash the
   node on DEV builds
