DESCRIPTION:

MB-39505: Group operation count stats in a metric family

To simplify ns_server/Prometheus-side stats queries and aggregations, a
single metric family "ops" now contains most op count stats.

Specifically excluded from this group are operation count stats
aggregated by vbucket state. These are still useful metrics, but are
not tracked at the requested level of specificity (they do not track
hit vs miss) and can not be cleanly integrated into the same metric
family without resulting in double accounting.
