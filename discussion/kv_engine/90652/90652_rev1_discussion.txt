DESCRIPTION:

Terminate the tests if the server is gone

If the server dies while running the tests we can might as well
terminate the test application.

We used the ASSERT_* macros in the code to check for this,
but gtest doesn't bypass the test if one of these fails
during SetUp. This cause a LOT of output on the console as
every test case will fail from this point on).
