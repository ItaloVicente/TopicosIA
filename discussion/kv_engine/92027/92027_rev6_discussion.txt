DESCRIPTION:

Extend HashTableEvictionItemPagerTest

During the investigation into improving the performance of the
mfu_hifi hash table eviction algorithm it has been useful to Extend
the associated unit test.

Firstly two variants have been created; one for persistent (couchbase)
buckets and the other for ephemeral buckets.

Secondly it is useful to test evicting from both replica and active
vbuckets.
