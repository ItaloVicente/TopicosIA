DESCRIPTION:

MB-32766: Never purge the default collection tombstone

Collection life time 101:

a) create a collection => we store a system event
  - "create of collection x @ seqno y"
b) drop a collection => we delete that system event (becomes a tombstone)
c) 1 hour 3 days later we purge the tombstone

However the default collection because we 'pretend' it always existed
we never write the create event (a), the creation is assumed. Thus
we can never safely purge the tombstone otherwise a client could
assume it exists when it does not.

To keep the tombstone, we set the 'delete' time to be ~0 so that normal
purging can never remove it.
