DESCRIPTION:

MB-30149: Convert dcp_interface to base class

Move the engine API's dcp_interface from an EngineIface member
variable (EngineIface::dcp) to a base class which engines implementing
DCP inherit from.

This initial patch doesn't change the definition of dcp_interface
(other than renaming it to DcpIface); it simply updates all uses of
the interface to be treating the engine as a polymorphic type -
i.e. dynamic_cast<> the engine to DcpIface.

Subsequent patches will actually change the members of DcpIface to be
virtual methods.

Line:285, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Just wondering why this is needed; would using the dcp member not be the same?

Line:5799, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Was this find/replace or intended? :P

Why can't we just move the methods into the engine struct and instead of making them pure virtual have them return NOT_SUPPORTED? That eliminates the need of multiple inheritage and would simplify the code elsewhere (as we don't first have to fetch the interface, then check if it is null etc..
Line:304, daemon/connection.h -> This seems to be something that is bucket specific and not connection specific? can't it be part of the bucket instead?

We certainly could do that, however I think it's simpler to have a few smaller interfaces (one for base KV operations, one for DCP receiving) than a single, large interface (ISP) [1]:

* It makes it easier to test - one doesn't have to mock / implement large interface if one only needs parts of it
* It makes it easier to change or refactor - classes which don't implement DCP  are unaffected by changes to the DcpIface.

Line:304, daemon/connection.h -> Sure - so something like a getDCPIface() on the Bucket object?

But at the same time we would need to add extra code in the core to check if the underlying engine supports it or not, instead of having the base engine class return ENGINE_NOT_SUPPORTED

Not really, as the refactor would happen in the virtual functions which just return NOT_SUPPORTED...
