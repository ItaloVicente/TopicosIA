DESCRIPTION:

MB-30149: Convert dcp_interface to base class

Move the engine API's dcp_interface from an EngineIface member
variable (EngineIface::dcp) to a base class which engines implementing
DCP inherit from.

This initial patch doesn't change the definition of dcp_interface
(other than renaming it to DcpIface); it simply updates all uses of
the interface to be treating the engine as a polymorphic type -
i.e. dynamic_cast<> the engine to DcpIface.

Subsequent patches will actually change the members of DcpIface to be
virtual methods.

We've added pretty minimal code to one common function (verify_common_dcp_restrictions); and checks in the executors in ep-engine which we'd need something similar anyways.

The problem also arises when

As an example in our code; if we chose to provide a default `return NOT_SUPPORTED`, it means we loose compile-time static typing.  Consider adding a new method to DcpIface - if it's pure virtual, the compiler will tell us if we forgot to implement it anywhere (e.g. in EWOULDBLOCK_ENGINE which needs to wrap the method and not just return NOT_SUPPORTED - this isn't the case with a default impl.

In fact this is exactly what happened in mock_dcp.cc with set_vbucket_state_rsp() - someone forgot to initialise the struct with an implementation and hence no implementation was provided. I also saw the same thing in another method (I forget which one now). By breaking the API into a number of small; well-defined interfaces (implemented using pure-virtual) we make it easier to spot such issues by letting the compiler help us.

Line:111, daemon/buckets.h -> Shouldn't this be EngineIface ?

Line:113, daemon/buckets.h -> Ditto

Line:209, daemon/buckets.h -> dcpIface would probably be a better name?

Line:31, daemon/connection.cc -> not needed as you don't have any other changes in the file..

Line:375, daemon/connection.cc -> not related

Line:50, daemon/connection.h -> not needed

Line:304, daemon/connection.h -> This change isn't related to the rest.. (as a side note: we should remove this and the getters and use the bucketIndex instead)

Line:110, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> we could move this into verify_common_dcp_restrictions and keep it in a single place? (and drop the check for the given method exists. If we want to perform that check we can do that when we attach the engine in the bucket and reject using the DCP interface unless all methods is provided (but when the transition is done all of them would exist anyway)
