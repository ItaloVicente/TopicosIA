DESCRIPTION:

MB-30149: Convert dcp_interface to base class

Move the engine API's dcp_interface from an EngineIface member
variable (EngineIface::dcp) to a base class which engines implementing
DCP inherit from.

This initial patch doesn't change the definition of dcp_interface
(other than renaming it to DcpIface); it simply updates all uses of
the interface to be treating the engine as a polymorphic type -
i.e. dynamic_cast<> the engine to DcpIface.

Subsequent patches will actually change the members of DcpIface to be
virtual methods.

Line:527, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> This error message only really covers the second operand of the OR condition. Maybe worth expanding to cover both cases?

Line:34, daemon/protocol/mcbp/engine_wrapper.h -> Is this include needed in the header file?

Line:26, engines/ep/src/connhandler.h -> Is this include needed in the header?

It looks like the patch needs rebase, and I've added some comments on the previous version as well)

Line:527, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> The two clauses are going away in a future patch; probably simpler to simplify then  (can do all the functions' log messages at once).

Patch v4 should be ok (I just rebased it), unless master has changed again... :(
