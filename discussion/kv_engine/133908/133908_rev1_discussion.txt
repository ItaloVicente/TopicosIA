DESCRIPTION:

MB-39864: Collection resurrection must result in correct metadata

Observed in the logs of the associated issue is that the open collection
data which is stored in KVStore (persisted) was that a resurrected
collection appeared twice. This resulted in a failure to warmup because
the VB::Manifest refused to construct from that data.

The cause of the corruption in the metadata was de-dup. The following
events occurred:

manifest:1 collections[c1]
-> flushed system-event creating c1 @ seqno 1

manifest:2 collections[]
-> queue a system event dropping c1 @ seqno 20

Some failure occurs which causes manifest:2 to be lost, system goes back
to manifest:1. At this point KV rejects the manifest because it's behind
manifest:2. But some other collection change occurs and the manifest
moves to 2 then 3, manifest:3 is accepted.

manifest:1 collections[c1] -> ignored
manifest:2 collections[c1, c2] -> ignored
manifest:3 collections[c1] -> accepted
-> queue a system event creating c1 @ seqno 30
-> flush

At this point we flush items

drop c1 @ seqno 2
create c1 @ seqno 3

but de-dup results in 1 item being flushed.

create c1 @ seqno 3

The metadata becomes corrupt.

1) The c1 collection (range seqno 1 to 20) never enters the dropped
   list and remains in the open list.
2) The c1 collection appears in the open list twice, with different
   start seqnos.
