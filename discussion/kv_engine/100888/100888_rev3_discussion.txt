DESCRIPTION:

MB-31707: 2/2 Use FlatBuffers for managing persisted manifest data

Replace the use of std::string and JSON for the management and storage of
the Collection::VB::Manifest into the _local document namespace.

Using flatbuffers greatly simplifies our code making it easier for changing
in the future.

Line:180, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> Can you flip this over to generate into the BINARY_DIR (to keep any build artefacts our of the source tree?)

Line:69, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.cc -> Suggest adding a space between these two fields.

Line:24, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_serialised_manifest_entry.fbs -> What size is a long in Flatbuffers land on Windows? (as IIRC `long` type is 32bits on Windows).

Line:27, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_serialised_manifest_entry.fbs -> Similary here - what size did we decide these need to be in the end - 48bits?

Line:555, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_test.cc -> Debug?

Line:24, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_serialised_manifest_entry.fbs -> The flatbuffers documentation states long is fixed as 64-bit, the code generated uses stdint uint64_t for this 

https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/v1.4.0/docs/source/Schemas.md#types

The windows generated code does just this

Line:27, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_serialised_manifest_entry.fbs -> uint32_t
