The non-predicated wait in engine_testapp.cc is the only blocking issue I can see. 

-2 only because I spent a long while tracking down a similar bug recently which causes a hard to identify intermittent CV bug; and I'd prefer not to have similar issues here!
Line:368, programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc -> Suggest you use the predicated wait() method as std::condition_variable is succeptable to spurious wakeups (which pthread_cond_t isn't afiak).

Note - I don't believe the while() loop you have here is sufficient - consider a spurious wakeup where c->status is still EWOULDBLOCK (i.e. notify hasn't run yet) - the while loop would be exited at line 372.

I think we need to add a new boolean flag to the MockCookie (`notified` or similar) which is set inside notify_io_complete() (once the mutex is acquired but before the notify_all()); and cond.wait() should retry until that `notified` flag it set; it can then clear it after condt.wait() completes.

Line:458, programs/engine_testapp/mock_server.cc -> Style: Although I think this is correct; as per similar comment I think it's safer / clearer to use the predicated form of wait() so it's obvious to the reader that we have a wait() which is handling spurious wakeups.

Line:368, programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc -> I'll fix this (btw. pthread_cond_wait may also get spurious wakeup which is why I just flipped this code over without trying to "clean up"). The main motivation was to be able to remove our own wrapper
