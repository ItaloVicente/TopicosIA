DESCRIPTION:

MB-48038: Avoid call to CM::getMemoryUsageOfUnrefCheckpoints in visitor

That is a O(N = ckpt-list-size) call that would be expensive in the case
of many checkpoints in the CheckpointList.

Also, this patch fixes a wrong accounting of memory released in the
CheckpointVisitor. One side effect of that wrong accounting is that we
might end up dropping more cursors than necessary in the visitor. Or on
the opposite, we might stop the visitor too early and release less than
what needed.
