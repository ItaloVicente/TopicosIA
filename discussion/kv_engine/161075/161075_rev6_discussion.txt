DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386, MB-48038: Avoid call to CM::getMemoryUsageOfUnrefCheckpoints

Avoid the call in CheckpointVisitor.
That is a O(N = ckpt-list-size) call that would be expensive in the case
of many checkpoints in the CheckpointList.

Also, this patch fixes a wrong accounting of memory released in the
CheckpointVisitor. One side effect of that wrong accounting is that we
might end up dropping more cursors than necessary in the visitor. Or on
the opposite, we might stop the visitor too early and release less than
what needed.

Line:48, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_visitor.cc -> same comment as in the earlier patch, probably worth trying to remove checkpoints before the first cursor is dropped just in case there's enough memory recovered that there's then no need to drop any cursors
