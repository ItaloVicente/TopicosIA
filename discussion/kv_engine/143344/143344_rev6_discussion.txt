DESCRIPTION:

Always log pending connections at bucket delete

Currently at bucket deletion we don't log the list of pending alive
connections if that list has not changed since the last time we checked.
If the system ends up in a state where the same set of connections stay
pending for a while (eg, minutes) then logs may wrap and we may lose all
info on those connections.

That has been recently seen on some customer issues where bucket
deletion gets very slow and fails the ns_server orchestration by
timeout. Those are cases where many different flavours of log messages
may wrap logs quite quickly. The result is that we just see logs like:

  INFO 45 Delete bucket [default]. Still waiting: 1 clients connected (state is unchanged)

This change ensures that we always get something like:

  INFO 45 Delete bucket [default]. Still waiting: 1 clients connected:{<conns details>}
