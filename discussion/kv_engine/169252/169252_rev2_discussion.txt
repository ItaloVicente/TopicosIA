DESCRIPTION:

MB-37858: Introduce the seqno_persistence_timeout config param

That's the max duration (in seconds) after which a SeqnoPersistence
request is temp-failed.
The new param is dynamic and replaces the previously hard-coded value.
Param's value validation is achieved within the EPConfig fixture.
