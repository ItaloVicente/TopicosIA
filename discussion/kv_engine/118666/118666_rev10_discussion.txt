Line:42, testsuite/basic/basic_engine_testsuite.cc -> The name of this function isn't very descriptive of what it does - a ready might assume it just does a single set operation.

Line:206, testsuite/basic/basic_engine_testsuite.cc -> Given so many (all?) tests create a MockCookie, you might want to move this into the SetUp() method of the test fixture.

Line:49, testsuite/basic/engine_testsuite.h -> Style: Simpler to just pass-by-value (then the caller can pass an rvalue which can just be moved into it's final location instead of forcing a copy).

See https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/modernize-pass-by-value.html

Line:42, testsuite/basic/basic_engine_testsuite.cc -> Will update the documentation

Line:206, testsuite/basic/basic_engine_testsuite.cc -> I guess I could do that..

Line:49, testsuite/basic/engine_testsuite.h -> That would force a string to be created at some point, and internally we never need our own copy (it is only used to print out a logging text _iff_ we fail to create the bucket)

Line:49, testsuite/basic/engine_testsuite.h -> So it's always going to have to be created at least once. The question is then can we avoid extra copies for both the rvalue and lvalue cases - and particulary when this function then calls another one, passing down as const std::string&.

In general the guidance (see the clang-tidy modernise link) is just to pass-by-value and std::move - that is close to optimal when calling down callchains where an argument is consumed / copied into something else - and avoids having to have both const& and && overloads (which _is_ the most optimal but needs two overloads of the function).

If you _know_ you only ever need to read a string (and never take a copy of it), then std::string_view (passed by-value) is both simple and optimal; but we don't (yet) have that available.

Line:49, testsuite/basic/engine_testsuite.h -> *cough* boost/utility/string_view.hpp

Line:49, testsuite/basic/engine_testsuite.h -> But the only time it is used in createBucket is a call to new_engine_instance which takes a const std::string&.... if we really have to change this we could might as well change the entire chain to use cb::const_char_buffer, but I don't see the huge win....

Line:49, testsuite/basic/engine_testsuite.h -> Agreed. My point is the default should be to pass-by value for cheap to copy/move arguments (like std::string) - it's mostly efficient and simple to remember.

Only if you really care about performance should you bother about the exact type (string_view if read-only, multiple overloads of const& / &&).
