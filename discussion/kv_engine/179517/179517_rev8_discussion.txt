DESCRIPTION:

MB-52276: Fix CheckpointCursor::getRemainingItemsCount

In previous patches Checkpoint::numItems has been changed from
accounting only non-meta items to accounting all items in the
checkpoint (empty item excluded).
After that change CheckpointCursor::getRemainingItemsCount() provides a
wrong/hybrid count of meta/non-meta items, so we fix that here.
With this patch "remaining items for cursor" accounts for all items
remaining, same as Checkpoint::numItems.

Note: A collateral effect of that is that cursors in checkpoints like

    [e cs vbs)
     ^

have remaining_items_count > 0 for DCP streams.
That is a problem for users that rely on that DCP stat for inferring
whether replication has settled (see MB-52553 for details).

Thus, this patch also ensures that DCP streams move their cursor to
the end of checkpoint in that state.
ActiveStream is resilient to that. This patch adds specific test
coverage for that.

Note: The fix here allows to easily make
CheckpointCursor::getRemainingItemsCount O(1). Dedicated follow-up for
that.

Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)
Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> To me this feels like an independent change (although one which you would also want to give consistent results for items remaining).

Suggest you move this code into it's own patch to make it easier to review / isolate for correctness.

Line:1583, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Haven't we regressed the (average-case) complexity of this? previously it would only need to iterate the current checkpoint until we found a non-meta item (so likely within 3 items); now you call getRemainingItemsInCursor() which will be O(n) in size of checkpoint.

Line:702, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_reflection_test.cc -> I'm a bit concerned we had to make a behaviour change here for something which is supposed to just be an accounting change. Do we now have unnecessary task scheduling happening here?

Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> > To me this feels like an independent change ..

You're right, and original this patch was split in 2:
1. Fix CheckpointCursor::getRemainingItemsCount
2. Ensures that DCP streams move their cursor to
the end of checkpoint

The problem is that (1) without (2) is exactly what would reintroduce issues like MB-52553.
On the other side, (2) depends on changes in (1).
Essentially the two are logically tight.

Do you prefer that I split again in (1) and (2), and I ensure that both changes are included together into the same build?

Line:1583, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> You're correct - I preferred to defer the optimization to a dedicated patch (https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/179571/4/engines/ep/src/checkpoint_cursor.cc)

Line:702, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_reflection_test.cc -> Here I'm hitting a problem in that transferMessage() (differently from transferResponseMessage()) doesn't consider the case where getNextProducerMsg() returns nullptr.

So why before this change getNextProducerMsg() never returns nullptr in this test? And why now it does?

The answer is in ActiveStream::takeoverSendPhase():

703  std::unique_ptr<DcpResponse> ActiveStream::takeoverSendPhase(
704          DcpProducer& producer) {
705      VBucketPtr vb = engine->getVBucket(vb_);
706      if (vb && takeoverStart != 0 && !vb->isTakeoverBackedUp() &&
707          (ep_current_time() - takeoverStart) > takeoverSendMaxTime) {
708          vb->setTakeoverBackedUpState(true);
709      }
710  
711      if (!readyQ.empty()) {
712          return nextQueuedItem(producer);
713      } else {
714          if (nextCheckpointItem(producer)) {
715              return {};
716          }
717      }
718  
719      if (waitForSnapshot != 0) {
720          return {};
721      }
722  
723      takeoverSendPhaseHook();
724  
725      if (producer.bufferLogInsert(SetVBucketState::baseMsgBytes)) {
726          transitionState(StreamState::TakeoverWait);
727          return std::make_unique<SetVBucketState>(opaque_, vb_, takeoverState);
728      } else {
729          // Force notification of the stream, with no new mutations we might get
730          // stuck otherwise as returning no item doesn't add this vBucket back to
731          // the producer's readyQueue
732          notifyStreamReady(true, &producer);
733      }
734  
735      return {};
736  }

Let's use a simplified example than what's in this test - Just 1 mutation

  [e:1 cs:1 m:1)
   ^
  
Takeover stream in Send phase:

1. Stream m:1
  [e:1 cs:1 m:1)
            ^

2. Queue set_vbstate(dead) in checkpoint
  [e:1 cs:1 m:1 vbs:2)
            ^
            
Before this patch the next call to getNextProducerMsg() ends up flowing at takeoverSendPhase():726.

While with this patch we flow in takeoverSendPhase():715. That's because now vbs:2 accounts in items_for_cursor.
The effect is that the ActiveStreamCheckpointTask is scheduled to run for moving the cursor to vbs:2.

Now (note that takeoverSendPhase() is executed at line 412 below):

411  DCPLoopbackTestHelper::DcpRoute::getNextProducerMsg(ActiveStream* stream) {
412      std::unique_ptr<DcpResponse> producerMsg(stream->next(*producer));
413      if (!producerMsg) {
414          // Run the next ready task to populate the streams' items. This could
415          // either be a NonIO task (ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask) or
416          // AuxIO task (
..
421          const auto auxIoQueueSize = getLpAuxQ()->getReadyQueueSize() +
422                                      getLpAuxQ()->getFutureQueueSize();
423          const auto nonIoQueueSize = getLpNonIoQ()->getReadyQueueSize() +
424                                      getLpNonIoQ()->getFutureQueueSize();
425          if (auxIoQueueSize > 0) {
426              CheckedExecutor executor(ExecutorPool::get(), *getLpAuxQ());
427              executor.runCurrentTask();
428              executor.completeCurrentTask();
429          } else if (nonIoQueueSize > 0) {
430              CheckedExecutor executor(ExecutorPool::get(), *getLpNonIoQ());
431              executor.runCurrentTask();
432              executor.completeCurrentTask();
433          } else {
434              ADD_FAILURE() << "Expected to have at least one task in AuxIO / "
..
437          }
438          if (!stream->getItemsRemaining()) {
439              return {};
440          }
441          return getNextProducerMsg(stream);
442      }
..
455  }

- producerMsg = nullptr
- We execute the StreamTask in the block at 430 (which moves the cursor to the end of checkpoint)
- We execute line 439, as (a) no item for cursor and (b) no mutation in the readyQ

That is where the nullptr msg comes from.

The next execution into the function executes at takeoverSend():726 and the test proceeds to completion.

That is a test issue only. A simpler way of fixing the test is making transferMessage() resilient to nullptr messages:

468  void DCPLoopbackTestHelper::DcpRoute::transferMessage() {
469      auto streams = getStreams();
470      auto msg = getNextProducerMsg(streams.first);
471      ASSERT_TRUE(msg);         <--------------------------- REMOVE
472      EXPECT_EQ(cb::engine_errc::success,
473                streams.second->messageReceived(std::move(msg)));
474  }

But the function is used by other tests so I preferred not to remove that assert.

To recap:
- The issue here is a test issue only
- The change in the production logic is just that meta-accounts in the DCP items_remaining, so streams need to move the cursor over them before they can state "no more items for cursor"
- Takeover is one example where the TakeoverSend phase might need to run another StreamTask+notify_connection for jumping into TakeoverWait.

  NOTE: That isn't new. With this patch the new behaviour is just that now a case like (at takeover)
        [e:1 cs:1 m:1 vbs:2)
                  ^
  behaves the same as (at in-memory stream)
        [e:1 cs:1 m:1 m:2)
                  ^
In both cases we need another StreamTask+notify_connection for moving the stream to settled.

Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> Mmm you mean on putting (2) first, I didn't consider that as probably some tests that I fix in (2) wouldn't trigger by (2) only..
But that's less important I guess, let me give it a go. WIP

The point is exactly in your question:
> How does (2) depend on one - surely we can just always more cursors to the end of the Checkpoint without changing how we calculate counts?

Cursors moves (or not) based on counts.

bool ActiveStream::nextCheckpointItem(DcpProducer& producer) {
    auto vb = engine->getVBucket(vb_);
    if (vb) {
        const auto curs = cursor.lock();
        if (curs && vb->checkpointManager->hasItemsForCursor(*curs)) {
            // Schedule the stream-processor for pulling items from checkpoints
            // and pushing them into the stream readyQ
            producer.scheduleCheckpointProcessorTask(shared_from_this());
            return true;
        }
    }

    return chkptItemsExtractionInProgress;
}
