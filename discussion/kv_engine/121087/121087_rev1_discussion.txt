DESCRIPTION:

MB-37529: Introduce "BestEffort" range locks

Normally, when a range read is acquired, it must cover the entire
requested seqno range, or fail.

However, it is desirable that the stale item deleter be able to run on
*some* of the seqList while backfills are reading a *different* range.
Currently, the stale item deleter tries to lock a seqno range covering
the entire seqList, which will fail if a backfill is in progress.

This patch allow users of range locks to specify whether the requested
range must be met exactly, or if a reduced portion of that range would
be acceptable.

This functionality is not used in this patch; the stale item deleter
will be made to use it in a later patch.

Line:197, engines/ep/src/range_read.h -> I think "Partial" might be a better term, "BestEffort" (to me) implies that it may or may not give you a lock at all (i.e. akin to "try").
