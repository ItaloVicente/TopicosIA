DESCRIPTION:

MB-46827: Remove cursor_dropping_<lower/upper>_mark

With bounded checkpoint mem-usage we are going to trigger checkpoint
memory recovery only when the checkpoint mem-usage is high.

The params that I'm removing here are used for triggering checkpoint
memory recovery also when the overall mem-usage of the system (not the
checkpoints one specifically) is high.
Which is a behaviour that we want to remove: if some other components
shows up high mem-usage then we should release memory from there, not
from checkpoints.

Here I also remove some ep_testuite tests that specifically verify the
behaviour of the params that I'm removing. A new version of those tests
will be re-introduced (possibly as ep-unit-tests) at the right time in
following patches to verify the new triggers for checkpoint
mem-recovery.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Note we should flag this MB has 'releastnote' in Jira as we should document the newly-added config parameters, and the removal of the old ones.

Line:54, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> > "cursor_dropping_checkpoint_mem_upper_mark and 'mem_used' (Y) ..."

This could be interpreted that _both_ conditions need to be true, which I believe is incorrect?

(It's logical OR)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:54, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> You're right.
Given that this patch already got CV+1 and given that all this changes again in follow-up patches, are you happy to avoid to push the patch again here?
This is where this all changes again http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/157579/1/engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc
