DESCRIPTION:

MB-39344: Close disk checkpoint at snapshot-end-seqno received

At replica checkpoints are created when PassiveStream receives a
SnapshotMarker.
Because of that, a fully received checkpoint may hang in memory for a
long time, as it will be closed (and fully deallocated) only when
PassiveStream will receive the SnapshotMarker for a subsequnt snapshot
(if any).

In past that has cause memory consumption issues (eg, MB-30019). Since
then, new features like ItemExpel has mostly resolved issues on the
memory consumption in the CheckpointManager. But, closing a checkpoint
allows its removal and complete deallocation, which can still give us
back some memory.

Note that we could do the same for Memory checkpoints. MB-30019 is the
last attempt of doing that, and it has caused a relevant frontend
throughput degradation. The suboptimal code that causes the degradation
is still there, so for now we are restricting the scope to Disk
checkpoints. See MB-30019 for details.
