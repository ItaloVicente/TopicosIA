DESCRIPTION:

MB-39292: set_collections persist current manifest

set_collections only allows 'forward' progress after checking
that the new manifest is a successor of the current manifest,
however after warm-up we have to accept whatever we are given.

This commit updates set_collections so that for persistent buckets
the new manifest is first stored in the database directory and
then we update from that manifest on-success, now warm-up brings
the manifest back from storage and we can validate that further
updates are a valid successor.

Ephemeral buckets just update with no background task.

This patch stores using Manifest::toJSON and reloads JSON using
Manifest's existing construction with no integrity checking.
