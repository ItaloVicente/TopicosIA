Line:427, engines/ep/docs/stats.org -> were these introduced in a different patch? Don't seem to match up with the commit message/code change

Line:427, engines/ep/docs/stats.org -> Yes, they are already on the left side in fact, I had to touch again these lines only to update the description

Related to all these changes - I also think it's worth adding some simple tests to check the values of all these various new stats. Something as simple as creating a CheckpointManager, add a checkpoint, add a couple of keys, then remove the keys, then remove the checkpoint and check the values increase / decrease as expected is fine (given you will probably see differences in exact numbers across platforms...)
Line:1510, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I think having a different name for this method (getMemOverheadQueue) and the Checkpoint-level method (getQueueMemOverhead) is potentially confusing. They are the same quantity (just accumulated at different levels), can we give them the same name?

Line:1519, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Ditto

We have such test already for other stats, I'll expand that

Actually the CM quantities here exposed to stats were already covered in the test mentioned (see CheckpointMemoryTrackingTest)
