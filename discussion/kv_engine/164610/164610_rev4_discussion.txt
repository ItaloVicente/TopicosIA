DESCRIPTION:

MB-48587: Checkpoint::getMemoryOverhead returns the tracked estimate

All the logic for enforcing the CM quota relies on an estimate of the
CM mem usage. Differently, the legacy accounting for mem-overhead uses
Checkpoint's allocator logic.

This patch fixes the incostistency by exposing the existing overhead
estimate for stats and other user's usage.
Note that the legacy allocator quantities aren't removed and still
exposed via dedicate Checkpoint stats.
