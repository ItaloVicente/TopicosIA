DESCRIPTION:

MB-26470: Use weak_ptr when non-owner objs hold ref to a stream obj

The DCP producer conn owns the stream obj and holds a ref counted
shared ptr to it. All other objs, say like backfill obj, that need
the stream obj must only hold a weak_ptr to it inorder to avoid
cyclic reference issues.

Line:555, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> I think there is a bug here.
We do not explicitly remove the closed stream from the 'queuedVbuckets' and 'queue'.
If a stream is deleted in the producer streamsMap and is recreated on the same vbucket and calls pushUnique on it AND if the 'queuedVbuckets' still has the older record of the stream here then we miss processing the newly added stream.
We should fix this for spock if the reviewers agree there is a bug indeed

Generally looks good - few minor issues.

I'd also suggest adding a description / diagram of the ownership relationship between Producer / Connection / Stream to aid the reader.
Line:101, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill.h -> If this cannot be changed after creation then make const. Also - use the correct type (VBucket::id_type).

Line:555, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> I agree it sounds like a bug. Can you create a unit test to demonstrate the issue, and if so raise a separate MB for it - which we should fix in 5.0.1.

Regarding the fix, we can probably check if queuedVBuckets[vbid] can be locked (i.e. is still a valid ptr), and if not then push the given argument.

Line:566, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> Prefer the correct type - VBucket::id_type.
