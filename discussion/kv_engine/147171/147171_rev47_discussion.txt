DESCRIPTION:

MB-47197: Add support for cross-connection limits [1/n]

As part of MB-46881 one needs to be able to rate limit clients
based upon total usage across all their connection.

In order to try out the prototype set the environment
variable COUCHBASE_DBAAS before starting memcached.

The default user limits is stored in JSON files in

    <root>/etc/couchbase/kv/security/user.d/default.json

(There is a readme in the directory describing the format
and how to add per-user overrides)

In the current prototype the file is loaded _the first time_
the user logs in. Until the file has been loaded (or there
is no file for the user) the user is assigned the following
limits:

    Network ingress: 10MB/min
    Network egress : 10MB/min
    Operations     : 60/min
    Connections:   : 1 concurrent

We don't need the metrics to be absolute correct, so we use a
"sloppy" mechanism to enforce the limitations (which means
that one may exceed the limitations with a few ops/bytes, but
we don't care that much).

The check use a "SloppyGauge" which holds a minute-counter and
a value. Whenever we detect that we're operating in a different
minute we reset the counter. This isn't done with a lock (just
two atomics) which means that multiple threads may operate on
the two variables "at the same time" (two threads may decide
to clear the value and thread 1 clears it and sets its new
value before thread 2 clears it again). We can accept that
limited error margin to avoid having to add locks.

While the patch schedule a task to run ever 30 minute to
purge idle tenants none of them gets purged as the method to
decide if it should be purged isn't implemented yet.

One may receive cross-connection tenant stats by requesting
the tenant stat group:

    mcstat -b bucket tenants

Which retrieves the statistics for all tenants, or one may
receive for a single tenant by using:

    mcstat -b bucket 'tenants {"domain":"local","user":"jones"}'

The system currently only collect the following information
on a per tenant base:

    {
      "connections": {
        "current": 10,
        "total": 12
      },
      "constrains": {
        "connections": 10,
        "egress": 52428800,
        "ingress": 52428800,
        "operations": 6000
      },
      "egress": 144552,
      "ingress": 144264,
      "operations": 6021,
      "rate_limited": {
        "connections": 1,
        "egress": 0,
        "ingress": 0,
        "operations": 1
      }
    }

Enforcing concurrent connections is a bit "hard" as we don't
know the tenant until the connection is successfully authenticated.
We could abort the authentication and reply with "rate limit"
instead of authentication success, but that could potentially
break (old) clients. We don't want to return success and just
close the connection, as we want to be able to return an error
message letting the client know why it was disconnected.
To work around the problem we're disconnecting the clients whenever
they try to execute packets. That means that you could in theory
connect way too many connections to the server, but you wouldn't
be able to use any of them as they would be disconnected when
they try to execute a packet.

Add an entry to the audit trail when a tenant gets rate limited
to make it easier to monitor when; where and why.

Line:70, /COMMIT_MSG -> Would be clearer if we included units in these metrics - e.g. "egress_bytes_per_sec"

Line:319, daemon/mcaudit.cc -> Should this warning message mention rate-limited?

Line:94, include/memcached/tenant.h -> Assuming these are all non-negative, consider using cb::NonNegativeCounter (so we detect and flag any underflow).

Line:4, tests/testapp/testapp_tenant.cc -> Should this be BSL?

Line:70, /COMMIT_MSG -> So the motivation for _NOT_ putting it in there is that the it is per minute in production, but the unit test set it to per sec to speed up the unit tests (not having to wait a full minute barrier to get it reset). I could do "egress_bytes" and add another one with "duration" : [minute/second], but I think it'll only add complexity.

The text(s) will most likely have to change once we get integrated with ns_server.

Line:319, daemon/mcaudit.cc -> Oh yeah :D

Line:94, include/memcached/tenant.h -> they are all (except for curr_cons which I may change) unsigned counters we'll only _increment_ and never decrement. From the looks of it NonNegativeCounter use signed datatypes and basically reduce the storage capacity to the half. For most of these it doesn't really matter, but I don't see the real benefit for having to do signess checks for the increment. It would be better with a template type which only allowed increments and detected wrap-around.

Line:4, tests/testapp/testapp_tenant.cc -> Done

I wrote the file before the BSL change and forgot to flip it

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:70, /COMMIT_MSG -> It is a private API between ns_server and kv_engine so it needs to be agreed upon. As mentioned earlier: this was added as a prototype so that I had a way to tune the constraints until ns_server provided a way to do so.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:70, /COMMIT_MSG -> Assuming this is a private API between ns_server and kv_engine, I think we should just keep it at a single unit (say bytes / sec) and let the presentation layer do any necessary reformatting.
