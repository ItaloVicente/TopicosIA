DESCRIPTION:

MB-48094: Add new KVStoreIface::getCollectionStats() with vbid arg

Add new version of KVStoreIface::getCollectionStats() that takes a Vbid
as an arg rather than a KVFileHandle, so that there isn't requirement
to have created a KVFileHandle first. As this isn't necessary for all
KVStores and it can be expensive to create a KVFileHandle for some
stores.

This patch also refactors the majority of calls to getCollectionStats()
to use the Vbid. Rather than the KVFileHandle version.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: "some" isn't particulary helpful - for a reader they might want to look at the couchstore / magma code for the one which is slow. (It's not like we have loads of kvstore backends and it's tiresome to list them all...)

Line:247, engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Nit: Given this is just an override of the base class and doesn't do anything particularly different you can delete the doxygen block here (also it's incorrect as it refers to a boolean return value...)

Line:1444, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Is there any issue here in using potentially inconsistent values stats for different collections?

Given this is done once at warmup (and we share the makeFileHandle for all collections read) is there any real performance benefit in changing this?

Line:1444, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> True, for couchstore It's proabably prefefrable too to prevent has having to open a file each time.
