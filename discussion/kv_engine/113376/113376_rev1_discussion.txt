DESCRIPTION:

MB-35560: getPerVBucketDiskStats should skip unpersisted vBuckets

A rebalance failed due to ns_server having it's mcbp connection closed
when making a STATS(diskinfo.detail) call, if a valid vBucket hasn't
had its initial flush to disk:

    ERROR 214: exception occurred in runloop during packet execution. (...) CouchKVStore::getDbInfo: failed to open database file for vb:812 rev = 1 with error:no such file: Input/output error

If the couchstore file hasn't been flushed we should not return any
stats for it.
