DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Remove MagmaKVHandles

KVHandles were created to protect the kvstore from being dropped while
other actions were active. Rather than attempt to protect it as the
wrapper layer, we'll let the storage engine do the heavy lifting,
similar to couchstore.

Patch Set 1:

As a general comment, it's much easier to track the changes of a patch between reviews if you keep the same ChangeId for a patch instead of abandoning the previous one (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/123358/). 

Note if you accidentally upload a new Change with a different ChangeId you can simply copy the ChangeId from the original patch and modify your "new" patch to use that ChangeId to maintain the same Change history (and then Abandon the new one created by mistake).

This allows reviewers to see what has changed since the previous time they reviewed it, greatly assisting reviewers (they can just look at the inter-patch diff and skip over the code which is unchanged since their previous review).

Line:978, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Indentation looks wrong here now.

Line:1003, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> This comment appears misleading now - I can't see any locks being acquired (or released).

Line:1318, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> This extra scope appears unnecessary now (and might mislead the reader as to why it exists. Pleas remove.

Line:209, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Accidental change?

Line:268, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> This argument is now unused.

Line:564, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Style: You don't really need trivial constructors which just assign member variables - an initialiser list can be used.

Line:564, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> I've avoided changing this for now because there is a major change in compaction coming and because I believe this also will require a change to compaction_ctx and providing copy ctor.
