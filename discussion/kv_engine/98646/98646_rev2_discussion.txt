DESCRIPTION:

MB-30798: Update spdlog to version 1.1

As we need to make changes to spdlog we should first update
our version of it to 1.1. Make the necessary changes to
our code to use the new spdlog api.

Use the new buffer/size style string returned by fmtlib
where we perform custom formatting.

This won't build because the spdlog API has changed. However, it needs a cursory review so that we can merge it when we update tlm to pull our new version of spdlog.

We want to upgrade to 1.1, performance a few extra features we may want to make use of.
https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30798

As part of the changes to logging in EP Engine (BucketLogger) we are going to use the spdlog registry to manage runtime verbosity changing. In the master branch it uses shared_ptr<Logger> which is an issue as we want to destroy and free memory when a logger is destructed in EP Engine. To fix this, per DaveR's suggestion, I changed spdlog to use weak_ptr's instead of creating some shared_ptr wrapper that overcomplicates our code.

I've got a set of patches making these changes lined up and ready to submit for review after we have updated this, I can upload these now if you prefer but they won't build until after we make these changes and update Manifest to pull the new spdlog version into third_party

In this patch set the only changes were to fix the breaking API changes in spdlog. Notably fmtlib now uses a buffer/size style string instead of null-terminated string so had to modify our custom sink.

I was just curious about which changes we wanted to make in spdlog itself ;)
