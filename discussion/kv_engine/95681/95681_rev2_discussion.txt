DESCRIPTION:

CBNT: Reduce the number of tests being run

Remove most of the test which currently run on CBNT. This will allow
us to build up slowly, adding a test/suite at a time and monitoring
to check stability and actually usefullness as a first line defence
against performance regressions. The remaining tests are ones which
show as stable on the current iteration of CBNT, and which provide
a high level overview, testing the overall functionality of kv_engine

Line:20, tests/cbnt_tests/cbnt_test_list.yml -> Having said that, we probalby don't want to keep /every/ specific test here - there's probably a few dozen.
