DESCRIPTION:

CBNT: Reduce the number of tests being run

Remove most of the test which currently run on CBNT. This will allow
us to build up slowly, adding a test/suite at a time and monitoring
to check stability and actually usefullness as a first line defence
against performance regressions. The remaining tests are ones which
show as stable on the current iteration of CBNT, and which provide
a high level overview, testing the overall functionality of kv_engine

Line:44, tests/cbnt_tests/cbnt_test_list.yml -> Are these not very stable? I thought they were...

Line:10, tests/cbnt_tests/cbnt_test_list.yml -> I might be tempted to drop these two - IIRC they have about a dozen sub-tests each which are just too verbose at this stage I think.

Line:20, tests/cbnt_tests/cbnt_test_list.yml -> ditto - additionally there's probably a lot of overlap with the persistent variant - most of the stats numbers are probably the same.
