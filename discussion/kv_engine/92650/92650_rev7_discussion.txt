DESCRIPTION:

Add eviction category of stats

To aid with debugging potential performance issues a new category of
eviction stats is created.

In this category we maintain a histogram to record the execution
frequency of items evicted from the hash table (a separate histogram is
used for active/pending vbuckets and replica vbuckets.)

We also maintain a histogram to record the threshold used when deciding
whether to evict items from the hash table (again, a separate histogram
is maintained for active/pending vbuckets and replica vbuckets.)
