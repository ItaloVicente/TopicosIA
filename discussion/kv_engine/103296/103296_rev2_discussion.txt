DESCRIPTION:

MB-32394 [SR]: Add VBucket::commit & seqnoAcknowledged()

Add commit() and seqnoAcknowledged() public methods to
VBucket. commit() will be called by the DurabiltyMonitor when it
determines a SyncWrite should be committed (to be added in a
subsequent patch). seqnoAcknowledged() is called by the DCPProducer
when it receives a DCP_SEQNO_ACKNOWLEDGE message.
