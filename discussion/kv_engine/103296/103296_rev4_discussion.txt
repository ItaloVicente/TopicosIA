DESCRIPTION:

MB-32394 [SR]: Add VBucket::commit & seqnoAcknowledged()

Add commit() and seqnoAcknowledged() public methods to
VBucket. commit() will be called by the DurabiltyMonitor when it
determines a SyncWrite should be committed (to be added in a
subsequent patch). seqnoAcknowledged() is called by the DCPProducer
when it receives a DCP_SEQNO_ACKNOWLEDGE message.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Line:524, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> This one seems unrelated.
Also, by looking at the unlocked_updateStoredValue() function I see that actually result.storedValue is &v, so the check seems unnecessary (given that v is passed-by-ref).

Line:523, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> As we have seen previously, this one is unused.
I was wondering if we can use this as a kind of optimization (e.g., commit until pendingSeqno in a single call), but when we call down here we update the HashTable, which doesn't support that kind of sequential access by design.
So it seems that we can remove this.

Line:524, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Consider non-successful paths such as:

    case CommittedState::Pending:
        // Cannot update a SV if it's a Pending item.
        return {MutationStatus::IsPendingSyncWrite, nullptr};

Line:523, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I think I'm going to add an extra check that the seqno matches - to ensure this is still the correct "version" of the key. Will add in next patch version.

Line:524, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> My fault, I missed that :)
Nothing to change for me in this patch, but probably we should review this approach on error-handling in the future.
I see that we have other callers of unlocked_updateStoredValue() that use the result.storedValue without checks, maybe we can move the throw inside the function itself (given that updating a pending write is illegal by definition) ?
Writing this for reference
