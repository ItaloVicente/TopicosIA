DESCRIPTION:

MB-34634: Test that pre(k1)/commit(k1) doesn't crash KV

Add a dcp test case which triggered the issue seen in MB-34634.
The issue was a violation of the Monotonic active_stream
lastReadSeqno member variable where following the steps shown
in the test the stream tries to send back the seqno the
consumer already has.

The issue itself was addressed by changes under MB-34685.
