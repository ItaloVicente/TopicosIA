DESCRIPTION:

Let the command dispatcher call shouldThrottle

currently we won't throttle as the buckets don't have a limit
set up yet.

                        // @todo Set the state of the cookie to ewb (which
                        //       will cause it to "hang around" and schedule
                        //       a new task to check when we can resume the
                        //       connection (the "tick()" should be a place
                        //       to have the bucket reschedule an event
