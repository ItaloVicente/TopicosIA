DESCRIPTION:

MB-32704: Remove per-port setting of max connections

*Problem*

Memcached used to have a “per port” setting of the maximum number
of client which may be connected to the port. The motivation
behind that was that we wanted to keep a pool of connections
available to make sure that ns_server could connect to the
system (via the 11209 port). Later on when we added support for
SSL we didn’t have time to look at the overall model, we just
copied the “per port” setting into the new SSL connection. This
leads into the following “problem” with the current
configuration:

    I can have 5000 connections to 11209 (plain, ipv4/6)
    I can have 30 000 connections to 11210 (plain, ipv4/6)
    I can have 30 000 connections to 11207 (SSL, ipv4/6)

In a deployment which use a mix of SSL and plain clients one may
use 60k clients connected to the system (30k of each type), but
deployments which only use PLAIN connections may only use 30k
connections (trying to use 30 001 would fail, even if we don’t
use a single SSL connection).

*Solution*

The configuration file provided to memcached contains two new
toplevel keys in the configuration:

    max_connections    - A number containing the maximum number
                         of connections allowed to memcached
                        (65k if we use the values in the example
                        above)

    system_connections - A number reserved for users authenticated
                         as system users. (5k if we use the values
                         in the example above)

memcached continues to accept all sockets until we reach
max_connections, at that time it'll accept the socket and
immediately close the socket.

To make sure that the normal client's don't occupy all of the
connections to the server, memcached performs checks in the
validation phase to determine if connections needs to be
closed by using the following logic:

     1. If the connection is represent a system-internal user,
        leave the connection alone and continue to execute the
        command.

     2. If we've exceeded the number of "user" connections (60k
        in the example above) and used more than half of the system
        connections the connection is disconnected if it is
        authenticated or the commad being executed isn't one of
        Hello, SaslListMech, SaslAuth or SaslStep.

Line:447, daemon/memcached.cc -> Long line - please wrap.

Line:452, daemon/memcached.cc -> Same

Line:2193, daemon/memcached.cc -> Can you move maximizeFileDescriptors() after the FMA3_enable - IIRC _any_ mathematical operations are unsafe before that.

Line:442, daemon/statemachine.cc -> Long line.

Line:419, tests/testapp/testapp.cc -> What are we doing about the old config settings? Users may have already customised the maximum number of connections.

Ideally we'd grandfather in the old settings if possible, but if that's not feasible I think we need to flag the MB with "release note" and ensure it's documented that users need to change their settings.

Line:447, daemon/memcached.cc -> No, wrapping error messages makes them a lot harder to find as one cannot grep for them

Line:452, daemon/memcached.cc -> ditto

Line:2193, daemon/memcached.cc -> Done

Line:442, daemon/statemachine.cc -> as before.. this ease grepping in the code

Line:419, tests/testapp/testapp.cc -> As I commented on the MB. I doubt it really matter as the default configuration now is 2x what we used to have.. (we should put it in the release notes so I'll add that to the MB)

Line:447, daemon/memcached.cc -> It breaks the KV-Engine coding standards: https://github.com/couchbase/memcached/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#source-code-width

All our existing log methods wrap if longer than 80 chars, you can trivially grep for a subset of the log file.

Line:447, daemon/memcached.cc -> We've got a fair amount of code which exceeds 80 character max width, and I'd rather revisit the fixed rule to enforce line wraps in error messages which may be found in logs as it aids debugability to easily copy and paste into grep/opengrok.
