DESCRIPTION:

Refactor [SR]: Remove the MockDurabilityMonitor class

The mock class was exposing mostly const-methods. We can just expose
those to the DM public interface.
Also, a DM instance is owned by VBucket. Given that in all DM tests we
already have access to VBucket, then there is no much gain in hiding the
DM's services.
