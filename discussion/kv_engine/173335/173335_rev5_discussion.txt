Line:100, engines/ep/src/failover-table.h -> Nit: Seems like an unnecessary blank line.

Also you could use single-line `///` doxygen comment to be a bit terser.

Line:53, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/failover_table_test.cc -> Note that you would throw if you attempted to access `result->rollbackSeqno` if the optional was false; so arguably more correct to use `ASSERT_TRUE(result)`.
