DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Only rebuild privilege context once

Move the check if the privlege context is stale or not to a
separate method, and call that before performing the
privilege check.

The motivation for this is to use a fixed privlege context
for the duration of a command.

Does this have any effect on the client - ie. the situations they receive a STALE response?

They no longer receive a stale request. We try to rebuild it and use the snapshot right after we rebuilt it

(new code will copy a snapshot of the context into the cookie, so that it'll use the same context for the entire duration of the command. Earlier we handled the case if there was multiple updates to the rbac database which happened during the privilege checks.. In reality that only happened as a side effect of the bug where we bumped the revision number _before_ parsing and installing the new file so that all privilege contexts would be stale _while_ reading and parsing the new file. when this happened for ns_servers connections (which didn't handle extended error codes and we killed the connection) it was considered a fatal error and it killed memcached)...

Thanks. Would be useful to include some of this context / background in the commit message.

Well, that is no longer a problem with the current code this code is changing so I don't think it belongs in the commit message for this change (as its already documented in the bug when we fixed it). When we're going to revoke access for clients (passed from ns_server) we'd be using the AUTH_STALE response again.
