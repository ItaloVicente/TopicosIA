DESCRIPTION:

MB-33244 [SR]: Don't de-dupe mutations with prepared SyncWrite in Checkpoint

When a Prepared SyncWrite is enqueued into a Checkpoint it can
incorrectly de-duplicate an existing CommitedViaMutation item - i.e. a
normal mutation.

This is incorrect, as the prepared SyncWrite may eventually be
aborted, and such it's result should be discarded. We therefore need
to keep both in the Checkpoint to send over DCP & persist to disk.
