DESCRIPTION:

[SR]: Use DiskDocKey for writing to disk

Update IORequest to use a DiskDocKey for the to-be-written key,
removing the need for the separate 'pending' flag.

In turn, StoredDocKey no longer needs to allow creation with the
'pending' flag - DiskDocKey handles this use-case now - so revert
StoredDocKey back to previous behaviour. CollectionID ctor now
considers DurabilityPrepare a reserved namespace and throws if an
attempt is made to create a CollectionID "normally" with that
namespace.
