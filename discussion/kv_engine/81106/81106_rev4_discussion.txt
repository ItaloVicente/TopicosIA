DESCRIPTION:

MB-20940: [17/n] Tap Removal - Move TapParam to ReplicationParam

The Tap Parameters consisted of the following:
- tap_keepalive
- replication_throttle_queue_cap
- replication_throttle_cap_pcnt
- replication_throttle_threshold

With the removal of Tap the tap_keepalive parameters is no longer
required and has been removed.

The remaining threee parameters are still required and therefore
have been renamed as replication parameters.
