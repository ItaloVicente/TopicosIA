DESCRIPTION:

MB-50333: Stream snapStart from Disk Checkpoint

Currently when we stream a Disk Checkpoint we take the seqno of the
first item in the Disk checkpoint and use that as the snapshot start
seqno. There exists a sanity check in the processing of aborts on the
replica that validates that the prepare seqno of an abort is within
the current snapshot if a prepare for it exists with a different seqno.
This sanity check can fail in the case where we receive the following
sequence of items.

1) Receive DCP disk snapshot from 1-1
2) Receive DCP mutation at seqno 1
3) Receive DCP disk snapshot from 2-3
4) Receive DCP abort at seqno 3 (seqno 2 was a de-duped prepare)

Fix this issue by sending the snapStart of the Disk checkpoint rather
than the seqno of the first item in the Disk checkpoint as the snapshot
start seqno.

Line:1360, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> So this patch addresses the problem as a durability only thing, but shouldn't the fix apply to the general case? ie, memory snapshots too ?

Eg, consider checkpoint deduplication, from in-memory a replica might currently see a sequence like:
  Marker(0, 1)
  Marker(2, 3)
, all snapshots generated by the same physical checkpoint.

If we apply your change to in-memory snapshot, then the above would become:
  Marker(0, 1)
  Marker(0, 3)
, with NO flag-ckpt and replica just updating the snapEndSeqno every time a Marker is received.

Line:1360, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Quick recap for me and I guess notes for Monday:

Currently we can send something like this (which is the issue when these are Disk checkpoints and we have some dedupe):
Marker(0, 1)
Marker(3, 3)

And if 3 is an abort with deduped prepare at 2 then the checkpoint/snapshot must be disk and we hit this durability exception. So what about memory snapshots? Two cases to consider, firstly single runs of the task meaning that we stream "full" checkpoints. Essentially the same as the Disk snapshot case but we wouldn't hit the issue because the deduped prepare for an abort case would not be possible. To fix this we would need to pass a snap start into this function in every case rather than just Disk checkpoints and only set it if nextSnapshotIsCheckpoint == true (line 1348 here).

The other case is when the active stream processor task runs more often and sends partial memory checkpoints... what should we do there? We could have some case in a checkpoint at the moment where we have the following:

1: Mutation X
2: (de-duped mutation Y)
3: Mutation Y

and we would send the snapshots:

Marker(0,1)
Marker(3,3)

As these are memory snapshots like above it doesn't hit this error, but again, it's odd. In this case the correct markers may be considered to be the following:
Marker(0, 1)
Marker(2, 3)

I think the question here should be do we do a targetted fix on the bug (just disk checkpoints if the connection supports SyncRepl), and make the behaviour inconsistent, or do we we fix this for all cases where a de-duped item is the first thing(s) in the checkpoint? Point of investigation/concern here is how will other DCP consumers cope with the change? Probably shouldn't matter, but maybe someone added a snapStart == first item seen check in some cases.

Line:1360, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Current solution is flawed because it is possible to send partial snapshots for a disk checkpoint (i.e. Marker(0,10) Marker (11,20) for checkpoint 0-20 and with this change we would send Marker(0,10) Marker(0,20)).

Line:1360, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Looking again this is probably fine, the fix is SyncRepl connections only so we'd have to flip to active to stream it somewhere (views is the only replica streaming service as far as I know). That means that we must have the entire disk snapshot at this point (or as much as we are going to get) and the hard limit for Disk checkpoint item extraction only applies to persistence so it looks like we'd send the entire snapshot

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1360, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> This change is now 2/3. The first in the series corrects the snapshot start of new checkpoints on the active, and the third makes this change for memory snapshots so that we can more easily revert it if some DCP consumer has issues with the modified snap starts.
