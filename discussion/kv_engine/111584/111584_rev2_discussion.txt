Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might be helpful to the reader to give the motivation for this / example use-cases.

Line:6, tests/testapp_cluster/CMakeLists.txt -> As an aside, I don't believe you need to include header files in CMake targets anymore - the current version of CLion is capable of working out which headers are part of which library automatically.

Line:31, tests/testapp_cluster/dcp_packet_filter.h -> Would making the packet zero bytes long (empty) result in it being dropped? If so I think that's worth documenting.

Line:33, tests/testapp_cluster/dcp_packet_filter.h -> Suggest giving each of the arguments a name.

Line:6, tests/testapp_cluster/CMakeLists.txt -> That has never been the reason for it ;) If you choose to get visual studio projects it'll correctly populate the "file tree" if it is lested here...

Line:31, tests/testapp_cluster/dcp_packet_filter.h -> I thought that was pretty obvious from the comment as we're sending the complete packet returned (and 0 means we're sending 0 bytes)...

Line:33, tests/testapp_cluster/dcp_packet_filter.h -> Done

Line:6, tests/testapp_cluster/CMakeLists.txt -> That was one reason for it historically :)

I wonder if VS has also fixed it like CLion has...

Line:31, tests/testapp_cluster/dcp_packet_filter.h -> Maybe to you - but I don't think it hurts to make it explicit :)
