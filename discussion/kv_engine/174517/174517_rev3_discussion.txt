DESCRIPTION:

MB-50984: Don't call detachFromManager() in Checkpoint dtor

Legacy code from Neo where CheckpointRemoval::Lazy might lead to
releasing checkpoints when still attached to the CM.
That might still be the case, but only at CM destruction, not in the
steady-state checkpoint removal path.

Line:99, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Are we expecting here that manager is null? Worth an Expects()?

Line:99, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Checkpoint dtor executed in 2 different code paths:

1. Checkpoint detached from manager and moved to Destroyer -> manager==nullptr
2. Checkpoint still owned by manager (eg, the open checkpoint destroyed at vbucket deletion) -> manager!=nullptr

So unfortunately the logic here needs to account for both scenarios

Line:99, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Reviewing this. Actually my comment was correct, let's sum up what going on here.

Essentially this if-block in ~Checkpoint was here for handling the case of Checkpoints that are destructed when they are still owned by CM.
For that, in this patch I move the call into ~CM, which is the obvious place where you would expect to find it.

The check on 'manager' was necessary because detachFromManager() is already called for Checkpoints when they are moved to the Destroyer. So the check was to prevent incorrect double-update on CM stats.

Now specifically to your question.
Manager might still be null or not here depending on the case. We have only CheckpointRemoval::Eager now, so:
1. Checkpoints that are destructed when they are owned by Destroyer -> manager=nullptr
2. Checkpoint that are destructed when they are still owned by CM -> manager!=nullptr

Example of (2) is the open checkpoint (or any other referenced checkpoint) at vb deletion.
