DESCRIPTION:

MB-35003: Enhance DCPLoopbackStreamTest for multiple replica tests

As part of the development of MB-35003 a diversion was taken into
validating how differing view of partial snapshots are  handled by
differing replicas. To fully validate some ideas a controlled multi
replica DCP test harness was required.

This commit updates the DCPLoopbackStreamTest so that the  tests can
create extra nodes and more easily manage the DCP producer/consumer
pairs.

In this change all of the DCP objects are held by a DcpRoute object
which expresses a route between two nodes. Multiple nodes can be created
(of which is fully demonstrated in a subsequent patch) and multiple
routes can be handled in a test.
