DESCRIPTION:

[BP] Move unnecesarily public HashTable members to private

Originally 7ea8971a6d681057dbcccaf3650739f2b4f6b564

A number of the member variables of HashTable are unnecessarily public
- no non-member functions access them. Move all these to be private.

Additionally, a couple of member variables had close to zero
non-member functions reading them. Fix up these few instances to go
via the existing accessor methods; and also move these to private.
