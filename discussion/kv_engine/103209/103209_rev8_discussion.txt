DESCRIPTION:

MB-32084: Fix data race in 'test_mb20751_deadlock_on_disconnect_delete'

This test highlights the fact that DcpProducer::backfillMgr member
variable can be modified from two different threads:

1. The bucket deletion background thread may attempt to reset() the
   backfillMgr shared_ptr when shutting down DCP connections

2. A frontend thread may also attempt to reset() the shared_ptr when
    a connection is disconnected.

As such, there is a potential data-race on this member variable.

Fix by adding a minimal version of C++20's std::atomic_shared_ptr
(named cb::AtomicSharedPtr here) which provides a similar (but 'dumb')
implementation of that class, using a std::mutex to guarantee
consistency.

Use the new AtomicSharedPtr for the BackfillManager poitner - note the
underlying BackfillManager object has it's own internal locking
already.
