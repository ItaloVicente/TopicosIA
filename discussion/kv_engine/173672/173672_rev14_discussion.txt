DESCRIPTION:

MB-51875: Add support for collecting metering data [1/n]

Add the skeleton for collecting metering information. Note that
all commands implemented in the engine itself would need to
update the cookie with the amount of data read / written

It is "easy" to track the write path as a successful document write
contains the WCU. We can't really use the bucket_get() methods for
counting the RCU's as we do multiple of them and might not return
the data to the user (also to implement retry logic on the server
for dealing with cas conflicts)

The intention with this patch is to get the infrastructure in
place, so that we can fan out the work to:

1) Get the RCU/WCU pushed to prometheus
2) Create a spec on how to calculate the RCU/WCU for the
   various commands
3) Account for RCU and WCU for the various commands according
   to 2.
