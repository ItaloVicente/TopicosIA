DESCRIPTION:

MB-34516: Make PassiveDM correctly handle prepares with deduped commits

Given an existing tracked Prepare for key1, if we are receiving a disk
backfill, if the "matching" Commit for key1 has been deduped the PDM
might encounter a Commit for key2 before the new Commit for key1.

Line:262, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> as discussed in person, want to add test that a double disconnect doesn't break the duplicate prepare acceptance window

Line:349, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> Style: prefer in-class initialisers - i.e. 

 bool enforceOrderedCompleteion = true;

Line:38, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> As previous, with an in-class initialiser we don't need this in the ctor; it'll be defined for all ctors automatically.

Line:227, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Can you tag this with the MB number Ben has to add this functionality?

Line:24, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.h -> This feels wrong - PasiveDM shouldn't know about DCP types directly.

I think this is unnecessary coupling between DCP and the DurabilityMonitor - the DM doesn't care about DCP stream types, just whether the current "mode" is ordered completion.

Suggest you change `notifySnapshotType` so the caller directly tells the PassiveDM if it should change into ordered or non-ordered mode.

Patch Set 2:

I think it's worth some comment or test to the effect of
"if we shutdown and warmup in the middle of catching up then because we bumped the HCS we won't load the skipped prepare into the HashTable and a subsequent resume won't include it in the duplicatePrepareWindow but that works because the original prepare doesn't exist in the HashTable"
