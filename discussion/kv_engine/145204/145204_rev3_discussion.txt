DESCRIPTION:

MB-43818: Log exception backtraces when thrown from if available

Make use of the backtrace recorded in exception thrown via
cb::throwWithTrace() when reporting unhandled / unexpected exceptions:

- In terminate_handler when an uncaught exception terminates us. This
  is in addition to the backtrace we already print of where the
  exception was _caught_

- In Connection::executeCommandsCallback() when logging an uncaught
  exception (just before we close that connection).
