DESCRIPTION:

MB-44079: Only purge commits if prepare already purged

Only purge the commit of a prepare if the prepare has already
been purged to ensure that we don't send a prepare without a
commit in a backfill snapshot. We accomplish this by only making
commits eligible for purging (marking stale) when we purge the
commit.

Line:369, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> I think I'm still confused here - isn't it the matching prepare we care about here?

Line:389, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Isn't this possible if this was a stale Committed item by virtue of range scans being in effect (i.e. it's stale with replacement)?

Line:249, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.h -> "new prepare" - the "new" feels a bit confusing; correct me if I'm wrong but the prepare we care about is the one which is associated with this Commit; we don't actually care about if a prepare with a higher seqno than this Commit exists or not (i.e. there's a new SyncWrite in progress after this Committed one)?

Line:257, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.h -> Nit: "Mark" instead of "Make"? - just because we generally use "make" to mean "crate an object"

Line:319, engines/ep/src/seqlist.h -> Might be worth expanding this comment a bit to explain more about purging eligibility.

Line:1152, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Nit: Missing closing ')'

Line:738, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/ephemeral_bucket_test.cc -> Similar to last patch, looks like a reasonable amount of duplication across these tests (but less than last patch), any scope to reduce / remove?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:369, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Yes, and the (probably barring dedupe cases) matching prepare is the prepare that we are visiting here during the seqlist iteration. However, there may be a new prepare in the HashTable (and if there's a new commit we shouldn't purge that commit). Dedupe and backfills sending mutations makes this a pain in the ass as we can't just say compare prepare seqnos

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:389, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> If that were the case then we'd be looking at the replacement (this is the hash table view) which should be higher seqno

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:249, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.h -> Yeah, it is the prepare before that we care about. That prepare may have been replaced by a new prepare though (which means that we can purge this). Of course that prepare may then get committed and we'd have a new mutation which we wouldn't be able to purge but we probably want to be able to purge the stale commits if we can't commit anything in flight
