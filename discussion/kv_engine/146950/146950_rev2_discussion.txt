DESCRIPTION:

MB-44079: Only purge commits if prepare already purged

Only purge the commit of a prepare if the prepare has already
been purged to ensure that we don't send a prepare without a
commit in a backfill snapshot. We accomplish this by only making
commits eligible for purging (marking stale) when we purge the
commit.

Line:364, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> OOI, what if the newer prepare is aborted?

If we get rid of the current prepare, but don't mark the committed item purgable, then later try to purge the newer aborted prepare, might we not see

`if (htRes.committed->getBySeqno() <= bySeqno) {`, the "uh oh" case below?

Line:247, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.h -> From the method definition this seems misleading as it's not being marked stale, just marked so that it may in the future be made stale?
