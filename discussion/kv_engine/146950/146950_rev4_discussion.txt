DESCRIPTION:

MB-44079: Only purge commits if prepare already purged

Only purge the commit of a prepare if the prepare has already
been purged to ensure that we don't send a prepare without a
commit in a backfill snapshot. We accomplish this by only making
commits eligible for purging (marking stale) when we purge the
commit.
