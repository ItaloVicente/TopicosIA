DESCRIPTION:

MB-38428: Run compaction and flush in parallel

This reverts commit debeb02d2c8e2474f8a02c5cf08a9fba96b89403 which
disabled the functionality in order to check if it was the root cause
for MB-41747. Turns out that MB-41747 was caused by the new cache
of couchstore handles which caused a "conflict" with the flusher
trying to roll back changes (but the couchstore instance had them
and they would be part of the next couchstore_commit)
