DESCRIPTION:

MB-51805: Set PassiveStream::cur_snapshot_prepare on new stream

We use the cur_snapshot_prepare member to determine if we should
notify the PDM of any Memory snapshots. It is set when we see a
prepare in any snapshot. Consider the following snapshot:

[1:Prepare(A), 2:Mutation(B)] Type = Memory

And the following sequence of events:

1) SnapshotMarker (1-2) Type = Memory
2) Prepare (1)
3) Prepare (1) persisted
4) Node restarts
5) Stream reconnects
6) SnapshotMarker (1-2) Type = Memory
7) Mutation (2)

In normal operation the PDM is notified when we received the item at the
snapshot end (i.e. Mutation (2) at step 7). In this case, as the node
has been restarted, the information that the snapshot contains a prepare
is lost (cur_snapshot_prepare is not set until the stream sees a
prepare.

To solve this, we can correct the cur_snapshot_prepare state on
PassiveStream acceptance. This should only be set if we are mid-snapshot
so we check if the highest thing (prepare) tracked by the DM is greater
than the snapshot start to determine if we are mid-snapshot (and that
there is a prepare that we must notify the PDM about).
