DESCRIPTION:

MB-51805: Set PassiveStream::cur_snapshot_prepare on new stream

We use the cur_snapshot_prepare member to determine if we should
notify the PDM of any Memory snapshots. It is set when we see a
prepare in any snapshot. Consider the following snapshot:

[1:Prepare(A), 2:Mutation(B)] Type = Memory

And the following sequence of events:

1) SnapshotMarker (1-2) Type = Memory
2) Prepare (1)
3) Prepare (1) persisted
4) Node restarts
5) Stream reconnects
6) SnapshotMarker (1-2) Type = Memory
7) Mutation (2)

In normal operation the PDM is notified when we received the item at the
snapshot end (i.e. Mutation (2) at step 7). In this case, as the node
has been restarted, the information that the snapshot contains a prepare
is lost (cur_snapshot_prepare is not set until the stream sees a
prepare.

To solve this, we can correct the cur_snapshot_prepare state on
PassiveStream acceptance. This should only be set if we are mid-snapshot
so we check if the highest thing (prepare) tracked by the DM is greater
than the snapshot start to determine if we are mid-snapshot (and that
there is a prepare that we must notify the PDM about).

Line:215, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> I have concern on whether this code here might set cur_snapshot_prepare=true in some case where we don't want to..

So the point is: at first look I would say that the stream is surely sending lastTrackedPrepare.. but is that always true?
Couldn't we end up sending only a snapshot that contains (eg) a commit (maybe just a subsequent mutation that has deduped all the previous mutations? ?
If so, at that point it should be cur_snapshot_prepare=false ?

Maybe you have already thought about that and there's logic that prevents that?

Not sure I follow this.

> Couldn't we end up sending only a snapshot that contains (eg) a commit (maybe just a subsequent mutation that has deduped all the previous mutations? ?

Yes, and that's exactly why we need this

> If so, at that point it should be cur_snapshot_prepare=false ?

Well, that depends.

This code is to deal with partial snapshots on re-connection of the stream mid-snapshot. In this scenario we stream all of the prepares before disconnecting. If we then stream the remaining part of the snapshot and there is no prepare then currently we do not notify the DM that we now have the full snapshot.

It's only necessary to notify the DM of this snapshot if we have a prepare in it, which I'm determining from the stream snap start loaded from the CkptMgr being lower than the highest prepare we know about.

Line:215, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> Is it possible that:
1. lastTrackedPrepared >= snapStart is verified -> cur_snapshot_prepare = true
2. but, CM has multiple checkpoints (eg 2) and lastTrackedPrepared is in the 2nd one?

If so, it should be cur_snapshot_prepare=false for the first snapshot sent over the reconnected stream (I believe)
