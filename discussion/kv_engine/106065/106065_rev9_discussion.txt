DESCRIPTION:

MB-33298 [SR]: Ensure seqno-invariant in DurabilityMonitor

At Vucket::queueDirty we do 2 things:
1) we queue an item into the BackfillQueue/CheckpointManager
2) and we add durable items into the DurabilityMonitor

While every structure ensures internal synchronization, it could happen
that we queue e.g. seqno:1 and seqno:2 into the CM, but seqno:2 first
and then seqno:1 into the DM for tracking, which is wrong.
Given that VBucket::queueDirty requires only a HashBucketLock, that
issue may arise when multiple threads issue durable-writes that fall
into different HashTable partitions.

This patch ensures that:
a) a proper exception is thrown if any actor tries to break
  seqno-invariant when queueing a new item into the DM
b) at VBucket::queueDirty we treat enqueueing in Bakcfill/CM and DM as
  an atomic operation. That ensures that items are queued into all
  structures with the same seqno-order.

Line:569, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> What's the runtime of this new test (under TSan / UBSan etc)? If it's significant then consider some of the below suggestions to speed it up.

Line:574, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> You don't really need different keys for each iteration - if you pre-select two keys which don't hash to the same bucket you can avoid them both locking on the same hashbucket lock.

You might also want to commit the items to avoid growing the DM / HashTable (and making the test run slowly).

Line:597, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> You can increase the number of HTlocks when you configure this test to increase the chance of hitting the issue.

Line:569, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> ~3/4 secs, long actually
I'll got with both solutions below for increasing the chance of failure at race-condition (possibly) with less iterations, thanks

Line:569, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> Managed to drop the TSan/UBsan runtime to ~300ms by increasing parallelism to 4 front-end theads, while keeping the chance of failure (before fix) very high (actually no false negative at build=Rel on mancouch).

Line:574, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> Unfortunately re-using the same key prevents queueing (isPendingItem status from the HT) until we commit the write. I could add the commit-step, but that would slow down front-end operations, which doesn't help in increasing the chance of race-condition.

Line:597, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> Interestingly enough, even setting the numLocks=1000 doesn't change too much. That suggests that our hash function is doing well with the default numLocks.
