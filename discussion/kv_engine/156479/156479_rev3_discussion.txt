DESCRIPTION:

MB-35075: Increase default concurrent item pagers to two

Under heavy workloads, the rate at which the paging visitor can evict
items may bottleneck incoming ops.

Testing bulk load on mancouch (Intel Xeon E5-2420) with:

* ephemeral bucket 10GB quota 60000000 * 1kB items

found introducing a second paging visitor increased the average rate of
eviction from ~48k/s to ~72k/s, and reduced the total load time from
1221s to 814s.

Ephemeral buckets are not necessarily reflective of eviction in
persistent buckets, but allow elimination of persistence as an
extraneous variable for testing the paging visitor in isolation.
