DESCRIPTION:

Don't run test_get_delete_missing_file() on Windows

Don't run test_get_delete_missing_file() on Windows as it makes the
incorrect assumption you can set a file to have perms of state 0 using
chmod(). Instead Windows make the file just read-only, so don't run till
this test's modification of the file to make it un-readable is fixed.
