(13 comments)
Line:1300, engines/ep/tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Comment needs updating.

Line:2410, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I think it's more generic / robust to make this predicated on if bloom filters are enabled - as that's what actually affects the meta_bg_fetch count, not magma.

Line:8103, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please update this comment as to why this is also disabled for magma.

Line:8495, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> That's definitely a problem - magma needs to support deletes on disk.

Line:8659, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> This test should conceptually work - it's checking that if the data files cannot be written, then write failures are correctly propagated back to ep-engine.

Please add this to your TODO list of functionality / tests we need to get working.

Line:8671, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Similary here.

Line:8690, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Same here - the test is just setting the local document to specific values, we should be able to modify the test to do similar for magma.

Line:1886, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Similar to previous comments, this isn't directly related to magma (we could have bloom filter configured off for other reasons).

Please update the comment to remove reference to magma.

Line:1890, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Simpler to use a ternary (with an updated comment):

 int expected_expired_pager = get_bool_stat(h, "ep_bfilter_enabled") ? 1 :2;

Line:1924, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> As pervious comments, not directly related to magma, and can be much more compact with a ternary.

Line:1944, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> As above, just calculate the expected number once then call checkeq(), don't repeat the same code.

Line:2005, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Ditto (and all the other instances in this file).

Line:1295, programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc -> Could you document why these values need to be overridden, (and why we shouldn't just change the default values in configuration.json to these?)

Line:1300, engines/ep/tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> I'm confused by the comment and your request to change the comment. We are in a block of code referring to persistent stores but the comment is about changing the error when ephemeral buckets are active. Could you be more specific for what you're looking for here?

Line:2410, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Done

Line:8103, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Done

Line:8495, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Why is this a problem? As far as I can tell, persisted deletes is used as part of bloom filters in ep_bucket.cc and magma doesn't use bloom filters. Why is it important that kv_engine know how many deletes are residing in storage?

Line:8659, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Added TODO comments

What I was referring to was that you have a comment talking about Ephemeral, but the code checks magma and couchdb - so at the least we should document why you're skipping magma here. 

A (better) alternative would be to skip the compact_db tests for magma if that API isn't currently supported.

Line:8495, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> getNumPersistedDeletes() is also used by ActiveStream::addTakeoverStats() to inform ns_server of how many items are remaining in a DCP backfill. Magma does need to record this information.

Line:1300, engines/ep/tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Hey Scott, I followed-up with DaveR, who helped me understand the issue :)

The change depends if magma can ever return ENGINE_ENOTSUP (in other words NOT SUPPORTED).

If the answer is no.  Then we should have a separate if statement i.e.

if (backend == "magma") {
  checkeq(ENGINE_SUCCESS, ret, "Failed to request compact vbucket");
} else if (backend == "couchdb") {
...


If the answer is yes.  i.e.can return ENGINE_ENOTSUP.  Then just need to update the comment to something like:

// The Magma backend and ephemeral buckets return ENGINE_ENOTSUP,
// and this method is called from a lot of the test cases we run on all bucket types. Lets remap the error code to success

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1300, engines/ep/tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> This comment and this piece of code are just plain wrong and I've no clue how to fix it. If you change the code to ignore the backend (I changed 'couchdb' too 'foo') and run ep_testsuite.ephemeral.comp_passive (one would expect to fail) or ep_testsuite.value_eviction.comp_passive (one would expect to succeed), they both fail. While ephemeral may set ENOTSUP, there appear to be couchdb cases that do also.
Rocks seems to work properly.
Another issue is ep_bucket_type is set to couchdb even when running ephemeral.
Also, magma does support explicit compactions so we shouldn't ignore.
This is beyond my level of expertise and I need help from kv team to clarify what should be happening here.
