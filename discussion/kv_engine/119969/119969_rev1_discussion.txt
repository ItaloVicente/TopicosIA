DESCRIPTION:

MB-37387: Remove support for GetK[Q]

These command was added to the binary protocol because
libmemcached needed the key in the response. Now that we
don't work out of the box with libmemcached (which don't
support features like vbucketmap, select bucket etc) we
can kill these methods.
