DESCRIPTION:

MB-52490: Avoid that a Producer consumes all backfills.maxRunning slots

That is possible in the case where a Producer is busy with many
backfills. Eg, the current backfill fixture implementation allows the
follwing:

1. backfills.maxRunning = 4096
2. Two DcpProducer connections with some active/pending backfills
   -> Prod1(active:4096, pending:100), Prod2(active:0, pending:1)
3. Prod1 completes a backfill -> Prod1(active:4095, pending:100)
4. Prod1 is rescheduled to run immediately
5. Prod2 keeps being snoozed and rescheduled to run only after its
   sleep-time (1 sec by default for the BackfillManagerTask)

The consequence is that Prod1 has much more chance to drain its pending
queue than Prod2.

This patch prevents that by ensuring that the backfills.maxRunning
slots are more fairly allocated across producers.
The logic change in this patch is that at step (3) and (4) Prod2 is
accounted when computing a single connection share. That share is lower
than backfills.maxRunning, so at step (4) Prod1 is snoozed, same as
what happens at step (5) for Prod2. That gives Prod2 a much higher
chance to take its slot in backfills.maxRunning at the next run.

Here the single connection is computed simply by

    backfills.maxRunning / num-conns-with-queued-backfills

In the example above share = 2048.

The computation is made at runtime after every backfill run. That
allows a single Producer to allocate all the backfills.maxRunning slots
if it's the only connection with queued backfill. Again from the above
example, share for Prod1 will be 4096 again once Prod2 has completed
its single backfill.
