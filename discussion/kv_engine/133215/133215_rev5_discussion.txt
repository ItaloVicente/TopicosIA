DESCRIPTION:

MB-40580: Refactor mctimings to use fmt over streams

Refactor mctimings to use fmt over streams as its been benchmarked to be
faster and makes output messages much easier to read as messages are
separated from arguments. Part of this work includes updating how we
calculate padding in Timings::dump().

Also clang-format and update header includes.

Line:29, programs/mctimings/mctimings.cc -> Nit - Would this match the coding standards better in the group above? spdlog is up there :shrug:

Line:161, programs/mctimings/mctimings.cc -> fmt has formatted_size https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#_CPPv2N3fmt14formatted_sizeE11string_viewDpRK4Args which might be more intuitive than log10 (if I've understood it's purpose correctly) and might be a more direct translation of the snprintf way.

Could also build a format spec rather than manually adding a string of n spaces -

 fmt::format("{:" + to_string(width) + "}", count);
e.g.,
 "{:6}"
or
 "{:<6}"
would align the text to the left,
  "{:^6}
would centre.

concatenating to make a fmt string does seem a bit gross though, so the std::string way might be as good. Could always do it nested to keep it a _bit_ cleaner though I guess

 fmt::format_to(buff, "....foo bar {}| baz...",
         ...,
         fmt::format("{:" + to_string(width) + "}", count)
         ...);

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I guess no one really care for that in this standalone utility ;) It runs on the client machine and this is "noise" compared to the time spent authenticating to the server and collect the stats ;)

Line:29, programs/mctimings/mctimings.cc -> It would would be better to just nuke the empty lines and have clang-format fix all of them

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:161, programs/mctimings/mctimings.cc -> indeed I think that would solve the problem was looking for something like fmt::formatted_size but must have not gone deep enough.
