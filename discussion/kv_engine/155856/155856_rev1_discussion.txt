DESCRIPTION:

MB-46900: Revert "MB-46216: Check log format strings at compile-time (ep-engine)"

This reverts commit f038ea04e42d8b79b0cc0f6c6e221ac86d5b730b.

Changes made to the argument handling of log messages are somehow
causing exception to be thrown when the BucketLogger is used with
a prefix.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Have you confirmed this addresses the issue? I don’t think the code in question isn’t going to go down the compile-time format checking, given the thing we pass as a format string isn’t a string literal. 

I suspect the issue might actually be in the fmtlib upgrade. 

Suggest we dig into this more tomorrow and probably address along the lines of what James suggested - don’t embed the connection name in the first argument format string but instead explicitly expand / format it.

This does fix the issue. I have a unit test as follows:
TEST_F(BucketLoggerTest, DodgyPrefix) {
    getGlobalBucketLogger()->prefix = "abc:{def}";
    EP_LOG_INFO("Test {}", "abc");
}

This test causes us to throw on current master.

Reverting this change puts us back to the previous behaviour of logging this:
"[*** LOG ERROR #0001 ***] [2021-06-15 19:06:07] [globalBucketLogger] {argument not found}"

Which is what we did in Cheshire-Cat. In addition "./ep-engine_ep_unit_tests -v" throws before the revert (current master) and works fine after. As far as I can tell it's something to do with 

I agree that we should probably solve the issue in that way, and I would have if the parameters/fmt interface required to do so were immediately obvious, but this was a quicker solution (QE marked the issue as a blocker).

Thanks for confirming. Is that the same scenario as the bug? IIRC the overall prefix (bucket name) is ok, it’s the additional prefix we add for DCP connections which is problematic?

I believe the test is. For some reason "./ep-engine_ep_unit_tests -v" is now passing after rebasing so I suspect gremlins on that point... To be clear, this test passes without this revert:

TEST_F(BucketLoggerTest, DodgyPrefix) {
    getGlobalBucketLogger()->prefix = "shouldwork";
    EP_LOG_INFO("Test {}", "abc");
}

And yeah, the engine prefixing looks fine
