DESCRIPTION:

MB-52676: Make ItemEviction responsible for eviction decision

Makes ItemEviction manage MFU and age thresholds used to decide which
items should be evicted (ideally the "coldest" items).

Also separates out a minimal interface in preparation for an
alternative implementation, relying on "up front" MFU tracking.

Line:45, engines/ep/src/item_eviction.cc -> nit: missing the close )

Line:24, engines/ep/src/item_eviction.h -> nit: doesn't add value

Line:1, engines/ep/src/item_eviction_strategy.cc -> is this still necessary?

Line:1, engines/ep/src/item_eviction_strategy.h -> is this still necessary?

Line:18, engines/ep/src/item_eviction_strategy.h -> nit: indeed

Line:21, engines/ep/src/item_eviction_strategy.h -> deserves comment, maybe some/all of the ItemEviction comment

Line:32, engines/ep/src/item_eviction_strategy.h -> The naming is ambiguous, beforeVBucketVisit (and afterVBucketVisit) would be more readable. Actually, setUpVBucketVisit and tearDownVBucketVisit might be better, we use setupXXXXX and teardownXXXXX in HashTableVisitor already.

Line:40, engines/ep/src/item_eviction_strategy.h -> does having sub classes implement a VBucket visitor make more sense?

Line:45, engines/ep/src/item_eviction.cc -> It didn't have it before either ;)


... not that I wrote it there too or anything!

Done

Line:24, engines/ep/src/item_eviction.h -> Fiiiiinnnneee, Done 😄

Line:1, engines/ep/src/item_eviction_strategy.cc -> Done

Line:1, engines/ep/src/item_eviction_strategy.h -> Indeed, chose somewhere bad to copy from it seems

Line:18, engines/ep/src/item_eviction_strategy.h -> Double deedin' done

Line:21, engines/ep/src/item_eviction_strategy.h -> Done

Line:32, engines/ep/src/item_eviction_strategy.h -> discussed below, and Done

Line:40, engines/ep/src/item_eviction_strategy.h -> I originally wanted to avoid visit as a term all together as I didn't want it to be visitors all the way down.

Existing visitor interfaces are generally concerned with vbucket filters (which are currently by id, so implicitly for a single kvstore) and HT positions and pausing and so on; I wanted to minimise how much this is coupled to all that, it's not really in the scope of what this needs to be concerned with - changing the impl of this doesn't affect how the visitor visits.

It both really simplifies testing and is hoped to smooth the move to cross bucket.

If we didn't need to support the existing impl, this would have no per-vbucket behaviour at all.
