DESCRIPTION:

MB-27105 [RocksDV] Set the size of the 'local' Memtable to the minimum

RocksDB constrains the minimum size for a Memtable to a hard-coded value
(64KB currently). If we give a smaller value (e.g., 4KB as we gave in a
previous patch) then RocksDB sets the size to its hard-coded minimum
anyway.
