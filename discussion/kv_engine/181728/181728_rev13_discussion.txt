DESCRIPTION:

MB-52311: [8/n] Pause / Resume Bucket: EPBucket cancellation

Extend cancellation support into EPBucket's prepareForPause() method.

For phases of this method which we expect to be long-running, add
support for checking the cancellation status of the Pause request, and
if cancelled undo any work done for pausing the bucket; returning
'cancelled' and in the same state as originally (before pausing).
