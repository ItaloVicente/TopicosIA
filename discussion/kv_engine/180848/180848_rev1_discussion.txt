DESCRIPTION:

Do not use exponent notation for floats in CBStatCollector

fmt::format prints some numbers in exponent notation by default. It
supports the f format specifier to always print the specified number of
 digits after the decimal period, but that results in a lot of "noise".

Format a number N.F to have at most max_digits10 - len(N) digits after
the decimal period and trim trailing 0s.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Can you confirm if this affects any released versions? (IIRC we only switched to fmtlib for cbstat printing when we added Prometheus support in 7.0.)

If so, we should raise an MB to track it and for considering backporting...

We have used the current way of formatting floats for CBStatsCollector since at least June of 2020 (https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/126198/22/engines/ep/src/statwriter.cc#25) and we've not had issues with consumers of these stats. Consumers are expected to support exponent notation.
