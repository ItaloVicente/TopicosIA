DESCRIPTION:

Swap std::regex to boost::regex in test name printing

We use std::regex to generate test names as GTest is very particular
about what it accepts and we want a readable test parameterization
name. std::regex is very slow which can be seen when we attempt to
run ep-engine_ep_unit_tests with a filter that matches nothing:

$ time ./ep-engine_ep_unit_tests --gtest_filter=
Note: Google Test filter =
[==========] Running 0 tests from 0 test suites.
[==========] 0 tests from 0 test suites ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 0 tests.

real	0m10.341s
user	0m10.255s
sys	0m0.061s

Swapping std::regex to boost::regex makes this 5x faster for a debug
build:

$ time ./ep-engine_ep_unit_tests --gtest_filter=
Note: Google Test filter =
[==========] Running 0 tests from 0 test suites.
[==========] 0 tests from 0 test suites ran. (0 ms total)
[  PASSED  ] 0 tests.

real	0m2.216s
user	0m2.154s
sys	0m0.048s

Line:642, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Do any of these actually search for a regex? 

You could just use boost::replace_all (https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_79_0/doc/html/boost/algorithm/replace_all.html)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:642, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Nope, replace_all is better, swapped for that.
