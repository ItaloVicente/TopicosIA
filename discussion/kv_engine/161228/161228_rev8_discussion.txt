DESCRIPTION:

MB-48038: Attempt CheckpointRemoval across all vbuckets before ItemExpel

The CheckpointRemover currently tries ItemExpel across all vbuckets
before spawning the CheckpointVisitor (which executes the
CursorDrop/CheckpointRemoval loop). That's because by ItemExpel we
attempt to recover enough memory without dropping any cursor.

But even before ItemExpel we should attempt CheckpointRemoval across all
vbuckets. CheckpointRemoval is faster and more effective than ItemExpel,
in particular in a scenario where we allow many checkpoints in each
vbucket.

Line:95, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Doing this in ClosedUnrefCheckpointRemoverTask might lead to long task run times - this task doesn't pause so it _could_ monopolise a thread for a while in the worst case for very large quotas.

Line:95, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> True, but same as the existing all into attemptItemExpelling(), so the behaviour is not changing here.

In general what we do in the CheckpointRemover/CheckpointVisitor is all about what we want to do with regard to mem-releasing strategies.

Currently we have a CheckpointRemover that does some unpausable work. That unpausable work is to try to avoid cursor-dropping if not strictly necessary.

Do we want to relax the "avoid cursor-drop" constraint? Then we can even remove any unpausable work from here and move everything into the CheckpointVisitor where mem-reacovery strategies are applied "vertically" vb-by-vb and execution may pause at each vb-cycle.

Do we want to try our best for avoiding cursor-drop ? Then we need to keep scanning the VBMap here and try Expel/Removal before calling down into the CheckpointVisitor.

Another option is to implement a pause-semantic here in the CheckpointRemover.

Again another option that I'm going to experiment is to move everything into the CheckpointVisitor (so we get the nice pause-semantic) and to make the Visitor taking a Strategy::Removal/Expel/CursorDrop arg, which would be the only Strategy that the Visitor would apply in its loop. In general we could make the Visitor super-flexible by giving it multiple Strategies to apply (maybe even ordered).

Line:95, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Forgot to mention: here I'm re-introducing a double scan of the VBMap that would be nice to avoid. For example we could do a single scan and try Removal/Expel for each vbucket before moving to the next one.
Again, that's a behaviour choice. We know that in general Removal is more effective at mem-releasing, so by attemptCheckpointRemoval() I essentially try to avoid Expel if we can recover by just Removal.
Note that the call to CM::removeClosedUnrefCheckpoints() is a very fast NOP is there's no checkpoint eligible for removal.
In the end only testing+profiling will tell us what's best to do.
