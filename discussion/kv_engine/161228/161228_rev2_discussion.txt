DESCRIPTION:

MB-48038: Attempt CheckpointRemoval across all vbuckets before ItemExpel

The CheckpointRemover currently tries ItemExpel across all vbuckets
before spawning the CheckpointVisitor (which executes the
CursorDrop/CheckpointRemoval loop). That's because by ItemExpel we
attempt to recover enough memory without dropping any cursor.

But even before ItemExpel we should attempt CheckpointRemoval across all
vbuckets. CheckpointRemoval is faster and more effective than ItemExpel,
in particular in a scenario where we allow many checkpoints in each
vbucket.
