DESCRIPTION:

MB-48506: Introduce the expel-cursor

At ItemExpel we need to change multiple times the state of the
checkpoint touched by the operation. The CM::queueLock is
acquired/released at every state-change, so we need to ensure that the
checkpoint is not removed between calls.

For ensuring that, the prologue of the ItemExpel code path registers a
temporary cursor (named expel-cursor for convenience) into the
checkpoint. That makes the checkpoint not eligible for removal.
The cursor is also not droppable, so nothing can remove it other than
an explicit user call to the proper API.

When expel has done with all the checkpoint state-changes, then the
expel-cursor is removed.

Expel-cursor logic fully introduced and tested in this patch but not
effectively used yet. In a follow-up we'll exploit the presence of the
expel-cursor for implementing the acquire/release/re-acquire
CM::queueLock pattern described above.

Line:226, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Here and elsewhere - why do we need special methods for manipulating the expel cursor? Can't it just be a normal cursor registered with the CkptMgr? 

I feel like the temporary state (expel cursor, etc) should be constrained to the scope of the method doing the actual expel work - i.e. expelUnreferencedCheckpointItems().

Good point. I like the idea of inlining the code as it is (and must be) used only once in the expel logic.
The is straightforward for register() part.
While the remove() part is triggered by at ExtractItemResults::dtor():

CheckpointManager::ExtractItemsResult::~ExtractItemsResult() {
    if (manager) {
        manager->removeExpelCursor();
    }
}

Maybe using the RAII technique seems unnecessarily complex here?
Ie, we can keep the ExtractItemResults for returning all the necessary resources to the caller, then at caller I can just inline the remove-cursor part.

Line:226, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Once expelUnreferencedCheckpointItems() has finished, can't you remove the cursor there? i.e. why does the temp cursor have to outlive the lifetime of the expelUnreferenced....() function - I thought it only really exists to ensure that the checkpoint isn't removed before the items being expelled have been correctly extracted?

I guess I don't understand why the cursor still has to be registered while ExtractItems result object is live?

Yes, I can and I m happy to do that.

> i.e. why does the temp cursor have to outlive the lifetime of the expelUnreferenced....()

It does't have to.

> I guess I don't understand why the cursor still has to be registered while ExtractItems result object is live?

So this will be the logic at full code is:

    expelUnreferencedCheckpointItems() {
        ..
        ExtractItemsResult res;
        {
            lock
            res = extract(lock&);    <-- CRITICAL SECTION
        }
        ..
        <lock-free -> scan expelled items and compute stats>
        ..
        <lock -> apply stats to checkpoint>    <-- Expel-cursor must still be register here, the checkpoint might be removed before this call otherwise
        ..
        <res going out-of-scope>     <-- I can just remove the cursor here manually rather
    }
