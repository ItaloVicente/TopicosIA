DESCRIPTION:

MB-34737: Remove overwritten Prepares from the PassiveDM

Replicas may encounter two prepares for the same key without seeing a
commit between them. If the replica disconnects after receiving a
prepare, if it reconnects and backfills, the commit/abort associated
with the prepare may have been deduped.

We allow the new prepare to overwrite the old one in the hashtable, but
we should also remove the old prepare from the PDM

Line:82, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.h -> Style: if you document along these lines then tooling (doxygen, clion etc) can give help on the specific enum value:

 /**
  * The reason a SyncWrite has been completed.
  */
 enum class Resolution : uint8_t { 
     /// Has met the durability requirements and is "sucessful"
     Commit,
     /// Failed to meet the durability requirements (within the timeout)
    Abort,
    ...
 }
