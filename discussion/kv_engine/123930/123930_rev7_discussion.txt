DESCRIPTION:

MB-38327: Interpret access logs written before mad-hatter correctly

An issue was encountered during offline upgrade from 5.0.1 to 6.5.0.
It was found to be while reading the access log for the first time
after the upgrade.

This process requires 6.5.0 to read a older version of the access log
format (containing MutationLogEntryV2 rather than the current, V3).
SerialisedDocKey was changed in 6.5.0 to treat the namespace prefix as
part of the key, rather than as a separate byte.

This required a compensatory change in MutationLogEntryV2 in 6.5.0,
however there was a small bug in how this was done; the struct was
padded by an additional byte, ensuring the key bytes started at the
same offset in the LogEntry, but this _also_ shifted the offset of the
length field.

This lead to 6.5.0 expecting to find the key length field one byte
later than it should - this caused it to read the docNamespace and
treat it as the length. This was always 0 prior to mad-hatter, so the
key was treated as zero length.

However - when "upgrading" the V2 struct to V3 to use it, the code
expected to strip a 1 byte prefix from the key (the docNamespace).
i.e., start + 1, length - 1. This lead to an underflow, and the V3
struct constructor copied the key and read/wrote past the end of
allocated memory.

Fixed by introducing a LegacySerialisedDocKey, which has the previous
layout.

I also feel we should be able to add some compile-time static_assert() checks in mutation_log to assert the various offset propeties we are relying on.
Line:282, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> This appears only used by the access log - please move it into that file.

Line:322, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> Seems odd that one method returns DocKeyEncodesCollectionId::Yes, the other returns No. If this is correct suggest some comments explaining why.

Line:345, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> This seems odd - clearly anything pre-6.5 doesn't have any namespace (it's always 0x0, the default collection. Why do we need `docNamespace`?

Line:380, engines/ep/tests/CMakeLists.txt -> This seems a bit pointless - can't we just use it in-place given it's not being modified?

Line:406, engines/ep/src/mutation_log_entry.h -> I don't like that we have +1, then -1 in different functions?

suggest we remove this len function (no one calls it except the new len function?) and just fold the math into the new function.

Line:406, engines/ep/src/mutation_log_entry.h -> Still used by the member len function a little below the new method.

I agree it is a bit messy going up and down like this, but I'm wary of simplifying it away and eventually leading to an off by one (Like MutationLogEntryV2::len seems to have had happen).

I don't mind making the new method do

 sizeof(MutationLogEntryV3) + keylen

with heavy comments indicating that this is only true because the v2 key lacks a prefix, so we are adding one byte but also have one byte of overlap with the MLEV3 struct.

I can also name it something more descriptive like "allocSizeForRecordWithKey" (but maybe less wordy :lol:), or "lenForUnprefixedKey" etc.  if that would improve things?

Line:282, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> Done

Line:322, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> Goof - changed one but not the other. Fixed.

Line:345, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> I can name it whatever you'd prefer, but it's there because that's what pre-mad-hatter wrote to it's access logs, and this class is just modelled to match that because we reinterpret_cast.

I suppose it is padding as we only really need to get the struct layout right, but it seems misleading to just put "padding".

Added a comment :shrug:

Line:380, engines/ep/tests/CMakeLists.txt -> Done
