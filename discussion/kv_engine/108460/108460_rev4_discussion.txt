DESCRIPTION:

MB-33959: Refactor SyncWrite for a second replicationChain

a) Replace SyncWrite members with ReplicationChain*.

Many members can be replaced with a pointer (ideally a reference
but Passive DM does not have ReplicationChains) to a
ReplicationChain. This makes it easier to add the second chain
as we do not need to duplicate majority and active in each SyncWrite
for the second ReplicationChain.

b) Rename variables/output strings to indicate they belong to the
first chain.
