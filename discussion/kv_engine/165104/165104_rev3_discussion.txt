DESCRIPTION:

MB-49207: Pass CAS to function queueing BGFetch

We'll need this in a future patch to compare the item driving the
BGFetch to the item in the HashTable at the time of it's completion.

Line:1662, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Looking further, I'm not sure the 'cas' argument is well-named - while we happen to be storing the value in the CAS field of the tempItem; it's not really a CAS in the traditional sense - for example the "CAS" specified here isn't compared against the bgfetched document; it's compared against the original tempInitialItem.

I'd be tempted to rename the argument to something like "bgFetchToken", documenting it as a value which is compared against the tempInitialItem to check if it's for the same version of the key or similar. Alternatively you could pass the actual (tempInitial) Item in; and have bgFetch assert that the Item& is tempInitial (and then have it stash the CAS).

In other words I'm trying to see if we can make the API here more robust / less error-prone - someone could pass any old uint64_t value in right now; but forcing them to have a (tempInitial)Item* makes it safer (with the possible exception it can be optional (i.e. the ptr can be null, in which case no check is performed).

Line:2333, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> "replice" is possibly confusing, the bg_fetch really just "completes" or fill-in the remaining information for a non-meta fetch.

Also - is this also valid if isMeta = true? Wondering if we can make the API cleaner; and possibly combine isMeta and can (say std::optional<uint64_t> casForNonMetaFetch) if CAS must be specified always?

Line:1662, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> A StoredValue is possible (from which we could create an Item). It would actually bloat the API more because we'd want to hold the HBL while we poke around with the StoredValue. I think we always need to make this check

Line:2333, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Changed to "complete" rather than "replace".

The bug as a whole? Yeah although I haven't written a test for that yet. It's the same issue, except we potentially restore the old meta. I'll add meta only fetching tests and an update of the MB to the todo list

Line:1662, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Sure, I'll rename the BgFetchItem bit and add some explaining comments in places

Line:1662, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I still feel this API could do with some work. As I understand it, the 'cas' here isn't used to fetch a value with a particular CAS (the normal usage of it), but simply as a "token" which must be present in the HashTable when the bgfetch completes (or the bgfetch is a no-op).

Additionally; while we store the value in the tempItem's CAS field; that's really just a convenience as it's a slot which already exists.

I still think making the API take a tempInitialItem is safer and more explicit - could you expand on why that won't work please? In terms of holding the HBL, I don't see an issue in passing that to bgFetch and having that unlock it before it does the other work under lock (as long as that's documented) - also that would centralise where the lock is dropped... 

You could even make bgFetch take an rvalue ref to the hbl which makes it explicit it "consumes" the SV / lock...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1662, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Thanks.

For clarification, I'm happy with the "physical" logic you are doing (give each tempInitialItem a unique ID, store that in the BGFetchItem, check they are the same on bgfetch complete); it's more the naming I think can be improved.

To be explicit; we shouldn't be referring to this as "cas" (as it's not actually the CAS value from a "real" document), but something like "bgfetch token", with a suitable comment explaining the logic and rationale.

(My worry is that at a glance someone might think that this "cas" is the CAS value of the document being bgFetched - which is confusing as without metadata how would we know what the CAS is going to be?)

Line:1662, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Makes sense and it should work having checked the locking of the HBL. I've made some patches that move the HBL into bgFetch and we now only unlock it in there. This patch now makes bgFetch take a SV& instead. Was still planning on storing the cas in the BgFetchItem though
