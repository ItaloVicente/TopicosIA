DESCRIPTION:

MB-25894: Allow topkeys to be disabled through memcached.json

There is a mutex contention inside the topkeys implementation in
the server and the easiest solution is to allow people to
disable it if they want to squeeze the last bit of performance.

To disable topkeys support the following command may be used:

  curl -u Administrator:asdfasdf \
       -X POST \
       http://127.0.0.1:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/node/self \
       --data topkeys_enabled=false

To enable, simply execute:

  curl -u Administrator:asdfasdf \
       -X POST \
       http://127.0.0.1:8091/pools/default/settings/memcached/node/self \
       --data topkeys_enabled=true

This patch opens up for ns_server doing "smarter" things later on.
It could be a button in the UI to enable it (could be located where
the table is), or ns_server could enable it once the user enters
the page etc.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Only "-1" issue is the incorrect memory ordering on isTopkeysEnabled.
Line:723, daemon/settings.cc -> Possibly overkill; but might be worth making `topkeys` into it's own settings group (e.g. like breakpad); that would allow easy addition of more settings in future - e.g.

 "topkeys": {
     "enabled": true,
     "size": 80,
     "..."
 }

Line:1004, daemon/settings.h -> We probably want acquire/release for these two methods here - relaxed doesn't guarantee that another thread would ever see the new value.

(Note that release-acquire is essentially automatic / "free" on x86 anyways, so there's no additional cost for us).

Line:71, daemon/topkeys.h -> Have you checked that  ns_server is ok with not receiving any stat elements in this case?

Line:723, daemon/settings.cc -> The intention was to do as little as possible... I could go for "topkeys":{"enabled":true} for now to keep it easier for future enhancements. (I'm not sure how to do the erlang magic to make it accept a json object for topkeys..

Line:1004, daemon/settings.h -> I'd be surprised if they didn't see that as it is called _once_ per execution of a complete command (and we'll pass multiple barriers through the execution of each command ;-)) I'll flip it over to acquire/release

Line:71, daemon/topkeys.h -> That's what happens if you don't have any data in the bucket (or didn't perform any ops...)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1004, daemon/settings.h -> I agree in practice - I was more thinking that our tools (TSan etc) might complain if we have the wrong ordering.
