DESCRIPTION:

MB-30865: [4/n] Allocate test keys as StoredDocKey

In prepration for leb encoding collection keys, if
we ensure test-keys are allocated, rather than views
of static c-strings, the test code will require little
work when collection-keys are leb-encoded, as StoredDocKey
will do encode the c-strings into heap-alloced storage.
