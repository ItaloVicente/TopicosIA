DESCRIPTION:

MB-54553: Propagate CheckpointHistorical to magma::saveDocs()

Passed when committing the flush-batch.
Primary usage is to inform magma in the case where the historical
data stream has been interrupted.

* Note *
Magma needs that the flag is always passed to the storage.
7.2 active nodes always create checkpoints with Historical::Yes.
While 7.2 replicas set the Historical flag in checkpoints depending on
what is received in snapshot Markers.
