DESCRIPTION:

MB-25517: [1/n] Remove dead code related to CMD_FLUSH and DeleteAllTask

'CMD_FLUSH' uses background task 'DeleteAllTask' to reset all vbuckets.
Since this is not functional for a while (apart from unit testing),
this commit removes the dead code related to this.

Note: 'DeleteAllTask' calls KVBucket::reset(). But that function is
      called during bucket initialize as well and also appears to
      be dead code. That dead code will be removed in subsequent
      commit(s).
