DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: move mcbp::Feature to cb::mcbp::hello::Feature

Add the features to the new protocol library and make sure
that we detect it at build time if we add a new feature
without updating our code.

Line:21, daemon/datatype.cc -> I'm fine with adding the cb:: prefix; but I think the `::hello` part is just creating very long names, and moreover isn't entirely accurate:

* While it's true that one controls these features via the HELLO request, they are really just Features of the overall mcbp connection - it seems a bit misleading to mention 'hello' even we are doing some other request which just happens to check  for example if JSON is supported.
* These various features have defaults controlled by memcached and/or ns_server. As such the user may never do anything with HELLO but will still make use of them.
* You're adding an additional 7 characters to every place we use these features. With the extra 4 added by `cb::` the fully-qualified names are almost half a line long. I think that's a poor signal/noise tradeoff.
