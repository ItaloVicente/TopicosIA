DESCRIPTION:

MB-27215: Collection item counting

Add functionality to the flusher path which will track how many items
are stored for each collection (and deleted). This value is stored
into a local namespace document (1 document per collection). Thus
if the flusher only flushes a run of 'beer' items, we just re-write
the _collections/beer document, rather than read and edit a global
ledger document.

A future change will reload the counts on warmup.

Ephemeral still needs separate support as there will be no flusher
tracking the items.
