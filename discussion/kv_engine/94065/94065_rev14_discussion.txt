DESCRIPTION:

MB-29484: Refactor CheckpointManager into its own source files

As checkpoint.h and checkpoint.cc were getting bloated, move all
CheckpointManager code to their own source files to improve
code readability and maintainability.

Also, clean up the includes from checkpoint.h, checkpoint.cc,
checkpoint_manager.h and checkpoint_manager.cc.

This change also has a not insignificant improvement to the
compile time of the kv_engine project:

Running '$time make' yields the following results for before
and after the patch.

Pre: make  197.18s user 40.59s system 96% cpu 4:06.50 total
Post: make  123.56s user 52.71s system 93% cpu 3:08.99 total
