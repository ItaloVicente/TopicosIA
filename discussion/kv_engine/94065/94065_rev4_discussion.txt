DESCRIPTION:

MB-29484: Refactor CheckpointManager into its own source files

As checkpoint.h and checkpoint.cc were getting bloated, move all
CheckpointManager code to their own source files to improve
code readability and maintainability.

Also, clean up the includes from checkpoint.h, checkpoint.cc,
checkpoint_manager.h and checkpoint_manager.cc.

This change also has a not insignificant improvement to the
compile time of the kv_engine project:

Running '$time make' yields the following results for before
and after the patch.

Pre: make  189.37s user 37.97s system 95% cpu 3:57.68 total
Post: make  161.56s user 30.66s system 96% cpu 3:20.06 total

Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

This is a pretty massive change, and it seems like a large amount of it is no longer "blaming" back to the original code:

  ‡ git show --stat 368baddcc|grep \| | cut -f 2 -d ' ' | xargs -n1 git blame -M -C | grep 368baddcc| wc -l
     527
 
i.e. there's 527 "changed" lines here which I don't think is what we should be seeing. 

Or alternatively, looking at the output of `git blame` but ignoring whitespace, moves and copies:

 git blame -w -M -C engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc|grep 368baddccf | wc -l
 306

Can you check you've kept the formatting the same between moving code?

Line:23, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Can we avoid including "checkpoint.h" here? As it is that means that any user of checkpoint.h ends up pulling in "checkpoint.h" transitively, which doesn't give much of a reduction in the number of places we have to include it...

Line:21, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Here and the rest of the places you've added checkpoint_manager.h - do we also need "checkpoint.h" ? I would have thought most of the time the class is only interested in accessing via CheckpointManager ?
