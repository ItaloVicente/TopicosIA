DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Use a single state for reading the packet

As all of the data is buffered within bufferevents we don't
need different states for reading the incommig data. This
simplifies the state machinery so that we've got a single
state where we're parked while waiting for the packet to
become available.

To simplify the logic more we throw an exception if we
encounter an invalid packet (or if someone tries to send
a packet 10MB greater than our biggest allowed documents)
and use the common logic to shut down such connections.
