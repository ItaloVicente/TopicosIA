DESCRIPTION:

MB-42760: Expose dcpConnAgg stats for Prometheus

The following stats available via cbstats

{connection_type}:count
{connection_type}:backoff
{connection_type}:backoff
{connection_type}:items_sent
{connection_type}:items_remaining
{connection_type}:total_bytes
{connection_type}:total_uncompressed_data_size

(e.g., replication:count)

will now be available in Prometheus as

dcp_connection_count{connection_type="...}
dcp_backoff{connection_type="...}
dcp_producer_count{connection_type="...}
dcp_items_sent{connection_type="...}
dcp_items_remaining{connection_type="...}
dcp_total_bytes{connection_type="...}
dcp_total_uncompressed_data_size{connection_type="...}

Note: The connection types are derived from the existing connections -
only connection types _which are actually present_ will be included in
a given Prometheus scrape.

That is, `dcp_connection_count{connection_type="fts"}` will _not_
be exposed until an fts dcp connection is present
