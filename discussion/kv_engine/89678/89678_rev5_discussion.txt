DESCRIPTION:

MB-27348 CouchRocks: Encode Block Cache hit ratios as integers

ns_server parses the STAT_GAUGES stats as integers. So, we need to
temporarily provide integer ratios. We encode a ratio as a 4-digit
integer, e.g.:
- 0.1234 (12.34%) is encoded as 1234
- 0.0123 (1.23%) is encoded as 123
- 0.0012 (0.12%) is encoded as 12
- 0.0001 (0.01%) is encoded as 1
