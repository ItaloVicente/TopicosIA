DESCRIPTION:

Add Ephemeral instantiation to StreamTests

Convert the following test suites to be parameterized on the bucket
type, and add an instantiation for Ephemeral (in addition to current
Persistent):

- SingleThreadedPassiveStreamTest
- DurabilityPassiveStreamTest
- DurabilityActiveStreamTest

Fix an underflow bug in the reporting of items for vBuckets in full
eviction mode where we may have 0 on disk items but a greater than
zero number of prepared sync writes.
