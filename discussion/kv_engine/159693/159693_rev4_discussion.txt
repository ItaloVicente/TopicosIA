DESCRIPTION:

MB-47437: 5/n Set the snapshot end correctly for a legacy stream

Primary purpose of this fix to call ActiveStream::markDiskSnapshot
with the correct end/maxVisibleSeqno so that a legacy DCP stream
isn't given a range that ends on.

* an item of another collection
* an !committed default collection item

The newly added DCPBackfillBySeqnoDisk::markLegacyDiskSnapshot does
the bulk of the work for this commit and the function comment describes
how it works and its limitations.

Line:276, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> nit: typo?

Line:301, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> When a cluster becomes completely 7.0 and sets the manifest, do we close all DCP streams or just replication? If not all, then the magma implementation of getCollectionsManifestUid will need to be updated to read from the snapshot (which is not the same as nor stored in the MagmaKVFileHandle). i.e. this call against a magma bucket will read the latest manifest uid rather than the one from the snapshot 😞 because the kv handle behaves differently. Could defer to Neo I suppose so long as we have an MB to track it

Line:325, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> could we separate this into a (!uid) case and the (supportsSyncWrites && uid != 0) case?

Line:343, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> Same as above magma comment

Line:360, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> may be worth a comment saying that this marks the backfill as complete

Line:364, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> same magma comment as above

Line:429, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> a potential future optimization could be to start the scan at the persisted completed seqno (seqno of the highest prepare that has been completed) as a completion should have higher seqno. If persistedCompletedSeqno == 0 and we've got this far then I suppose the only item in the default collection is a prepare and we could skip the scan

Line:122, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_legacy_dcp_tests.cc -> do we want this enabled?

Line:358, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> What happens in this case?
Backfill can't proceed, it sounds like we should end the stream too.. ?

Line:122, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_legacy_dcp_tests.cc -> it's using 400x more items but only seems to have a 5x impact on run time of the above test thought but does seem a little silly to run the test twice. I'll remove the test above and just keep this one with fewer items. Then anyone can modify the number if needed.
