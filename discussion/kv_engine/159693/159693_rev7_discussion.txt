DESCRIPTION:

MB-47437: 5/n Set the snapshot end correctly for a legacy stream

Primary purpose of this fix to call ActiveStream::markDiskSnapshot
with the correct end/maxVisibleSeqno so that a legacy DCP stream
isn't given a range that ends on.

* an item of another collection
* an !committed default collection item

The newly added DCPBackfillBySeqnoDisk::markLegacyDiskSnapshot does
the bulk of the work for this commit and the function comment describes
how it works and its limitations.
