DESCRIPTION:

MB-36860: Expand CheckpointTest to Ephemeral

While the initial purpose of this change was to expand the
CheckpointDurabilityTest fixture to Ephemeral, actually all the
CheckpointTest run only for EPBucket.

This patch contains the minimum change required for expanding the
fixture to Ephemeral. Some tests have been disabled for Ephemeral
as they require further work, which will be done in follow-up patches.
