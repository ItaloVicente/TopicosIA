DESCRIPTION:

MB-44452: Relax memory ordering of RCValue refcount

RCValue (the base class used for items managed by SingleThreadedRCPtr)
contains a reference count as an atomic <int>. Currently we use the
default memory ordering (memory_order_seq_cst). This is overly
pessimistic - the increments of refcounts do not need such a strict
memory order, and the decrements only need acquire-release.

Abstract the actual reference count into it's own 'RefCount' class,
which exposes just the operations required (with appropriate memory
ordering).

Note that benchmarking on mancouch (x86-64) doesn't show any
measurable impact in this change, and indeed examining the assembly of
compiled code shows the same instructions (lock add/sub) are
generated. However for other architectures (e.g. AArch64) this should
be an optimisation, and even on x86064 the compiler _should_ have more
leeway to reorder instructions when the STRCPtr methods are inlined.
