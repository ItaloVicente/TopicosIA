File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Probably worth expanding the comment message to explain why we are making this change.
Line:843, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Note: you could keep this line (or the equivilent vbh.vbid) and that would reduce the number of lines you need to change.

Line:162, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> If it cannot be null (and you aren't going to re-point it), prefer a reference to gsl::not_null<>

Line:309, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> As discussed, I think it's simpler to do this by attempting to open (with all CFs; create_if_missing=false), and if that fails (i.e. on first run) then explicitly open and create them all.

Note you need to ensure that the local/vbstate of all such newly-created VBs are in state Dead.

Line:469, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Suggest you use the bulk CreateColumnFamilies() method - and if that fails delete all the partially-create CFs - we'd be a confusing state if we only managed to create some of them!

Line:1296, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> We should just remove this - it's unnecessary paranoia which is going to slow us down (in a separate patch).

Line:351, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> Typo - "function".

Style (here and elsewhere): You don't really need to start each description with "This function", you can be slightly more terse and just say "Opens the DB on disk and ..."

Line:375, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> current

Line:1296, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> I've created an MB for this.
