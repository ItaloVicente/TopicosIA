DESCRIPTION:

Don't crash if compaction throws an exception

Errors during compaction shouldn't cause memcached to crash due to
run time exceptions being thrown. This patch adds a catch all
exceptions apart from std::invalid_argument exceptions during
EPBucket::compactInternal(), as a std::invalid_argument shouldn't
be see in production. Also MagmaKVStore to ensure that methods called
that do throw exceptions handle them in an explicit manner.

This also refactors the throw in CouchKVStore::compactDB() to an
invalid_argument exception and adds a test for this. It should never be
seen in production and is there to help define the needs of the
interface.
