DESCRIPTION:

MB-24244: Prevent duplicate items in an in-memory buffered backfill

This commit modifies the in-memory buffered backfill to avoid
sending the duplicate items. Why we should not send duplicate items
is explained in the commit 004652b7.

In case of buffered backfills we use 'seqlist range iterator'.
As we get the items iterating over the list, we check if a duplicate
item is present for the stale items within the snapshot. If so, we
ignore reading that stale item from the iterator.

In general I think it might be cleaner if the RangeIterator handles the replacement logic itself - the idea behind having an iterator class is we abstract the logic required to correctly iterate the container into the iterator.

Consider the case where another actor wanted to iterate the list - it would have to apply similar logic as this consumer has to; which is a strong indication that the logic should reside in the iterator.
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think it would be useful to copy that explanation into the commit message here, so the context of the problem is available directly here.

Line:231, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> Use explicit comparison to nullptr.

Line:233, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> You don't need the static_cast / conversion to OSV - getBySeqno() is a base class method, just call it directly on replacement.
