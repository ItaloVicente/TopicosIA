DESCRIPTION:

Add trace probes for bucket association

In order to try to identify where the time is spent in MB-44827
two new trace elements gets added unconditionally to the clients
trace log:

  AssociateBucket - The time spent trying to lock/unlock all
                    bucket until the correct bucket is found
                    and the audit trail gets updated
  CreateRbacContext - The time spent trying to build an RBAC
                      context for the user in the specified
                      bucket.

This adds a few extra calls to read the system clock during
authentication and bucket selection so it should not regress
the overall throughput in the system (those calls should not
be the majority of the workload)
