DESCRIPTION:

MB-32762: Add Exit Border Guard for dcp_message_producers

The dcp_message_producers interface is used by ep-engine DCP code to
'produce' (i.e. send) messages out to the network. In non-test usage
it uses the implementation provided by memcached in Connection.

A number of Connection methods can allocate memory (for example for
temporary send buffers); which is freed later on - when the call stack
returns back into memcached. Therefore to ensure memory
allocations/deallocations are correctly accounted we need to switch
away from the current engine when calling these methods, and return
back to the current engine after the method returns.

To make our handling of this less error-prone (so each caller doesn't
have to manually perform the necessary onSwitchThread() calls),
introduce an Exit Border Guard for dcp_message_producers. This wraps
the given dcp_message_producer instance, and for each interface method
performs the necessary engine switching - switching away from the
current engine before calling the guarded method, then back again on
return.

Make use of this inside ep-engine; removing the now-unneeded manual
switches elsewhere.
