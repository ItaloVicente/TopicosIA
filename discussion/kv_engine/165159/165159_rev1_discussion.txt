DESCRIPTION:

MB-49388: Avoid repeated memmove in AsyncReadCallback

A regression in the time taken to retrieve `collections-details` stats
with `mcstats` was noted. For 1000 collections in a cluster run on a
2019 macbook, master took ~5 minutes, vs 7.0.2 ~30s.

Perf investigation showed that this was not a server side regression,
rather a regression in `mcstats` itself - CC `mcstat` against a master
node did not demonstrate the regression, while master `mcstat` against
CC node did.

Profiling found the a large amount of time was spent in memmove,
shuffling unread bytes to the start of a buffer in
AsyncReadCallback::drain.

To avoid this, switch to using folly:IOBuf, which handles head/tail
pointers into a buffer, and only memmove data to the start of the
buffer if absolutely necessary (or when reallocating the buffer).

This change brings the average (n=5) time taken to 25s - similar to the
pre-regression value.

Line:113, protocol/connection/client_connection.cc -> You _could_ possibly be a bit smarter here - IOBufs can be arranged in a (circular) chain, so it should be possible to setup a circular buffer to read into; which is consumed once the data has been drained. You would only need to resize (reserve) if you ever need to read more data in a single read than the available capacity of the IOBuf chain - i.e. memmove should not be necessary in steady-state.

Have a look at IOBufQueue which might already do the hard work for you.

Line:113, protocol/connection/client_connection.cc -> I did look into that, but at the time of getReadBuffer it doesn't appear we know how much will be read into the buffer (or I've missed something).

So we wouldn't know ahead of time if a full request would fit, and splitting requests across two IOBufs would probably mean having to copy/coalesce to reinterpret as a header - which might not actually be too bad, if it's infrequent...

Line:113, protocol/connection/client_connection.cc -> Roger. Given we are already faster than the CC version, I think what we have is fine.
