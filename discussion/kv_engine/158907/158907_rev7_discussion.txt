DESCRIPTION:

MB-47707: Shut down connections when the parent port dies

Disconnect all connections which is bound to a server port when the
port gets deleted. The PRD say that localhost connections should
not be affected by this so we're using a hidden setting to toggle
that mode on/off to make a test which disconnects a localhost
interface being deleted.
