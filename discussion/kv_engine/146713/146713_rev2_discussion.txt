DESCRIPTION:

[couch-kvstore] Delete old compact files as part of scanning for files

Earlier we would first iterate over all of the files in the directory
and skip all files named XXX.couch.YYY.compact. Then we would build
up the map of all of the files before we would iterate over the
"current" set of vbucket files and try to remove all which
ends with .compact.

This patch change that to remove all of the .compact files when
we encounter them while searching for database files. This avoids
a burst of stats in order to check for the existence of a file
during startup.
