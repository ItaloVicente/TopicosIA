DESCRIPTION:

MB-47687: Prevent drop of rollbackable tombstones in magma

Magma's rollback callback iterates over the latest snapshot from
rollback checkpoints highSeqno to the currect snapshot's
highSeqno. This patch fixes multiple cases where dropped items
may not show up in the rollback callback.
1) If a purged tombstone is rolled back it will not show
up in the rollback callback.
2) Dropped prepares will also not show up in the rollback callback

Keys that are missing from the rollback callback cannot be
restored to kv_engine hashtable. To mitigate this, we don't drop
rollback-able keys.
