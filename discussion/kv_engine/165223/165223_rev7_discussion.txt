DESCRIPTION:

MB-47687: Prevent dropping on tombstones that can be rolled back by magma

Magma's rollback callback iterates over the latest snapshot from
rollback checkpoints highSeqno to the currect snapshot's
highSeqno. This patch fixes multiple cases where dropped items
may not show up in the rollback callback.
1) If a purged tombstone is rolled back it will not show
up in the rollback callback.
2) Dropped prepares will also not show up in the rollback callback
3) Implicit compactions are rollback-able. If they drop
collections and are rolled back, the keys dropped will not
 show up in the rollback callback

Keys that are missing from the rollback callback cannot be
restored to kv_engine hashtable. To mitigate this, we don't drop
rollback-able keys.

Line:63, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/magma_bucket_tests.cc -> Feel like this method attention is probably more appropriate to be in the MockMagmaVKStore as we have similar functionality for the MockCouchKVStore in our mock class, as this allows all of our unit tests to access the method.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:63, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/magma_bucket_tests.cc -> it probably does need to be here but this should already exist as KVBucket::replaceMagmaKVStore() and this class should inherit from that one (via a couple of others) so I don't think that this version is necessary
