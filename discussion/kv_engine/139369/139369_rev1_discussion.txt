Line:260, daemon/memcached.cc -> Style: you can simplify this a little with an early return:

 if (Settings::instance().has.prometheus_config) {
     return cb::prometheus::create(settings.getPrometheusConfig(),
                                   prometheus_auth_callback);
 }
 LOG_WARNING("Prometheus config not specified");
 return {};
