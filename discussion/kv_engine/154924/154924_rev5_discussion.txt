DESCRIPTION:

MB-38077: Enable unity in many large kv_engine targets

Enables unity on a number of the larger KV targets, however
excludes ep-engine_ep_unit_tests due to that being unstable
on CV.

Measurements on OSX dev laptop (including couchstore unity).

Prior to each timed build, caches dropped with "sync && purge"

Full build (cache disabled:

    cmake -G Ninja CB_UNITY_BUILD=OFF ..
    time kv_engine/all
    real    9m40.479s
    user    100m34.360s
    sys 5m5.939s

    cmake -G Ninja CB_UNITY_BUILD=ON ..
    time kv_engine/all
    real    7m17.510s
    user    73m54.601s
    sys 3m6.745s

24% reduction in real time for a full

Change dockey.h

    CB_UNITY_BUILD=OFF
    real    8m17.463s
    user    85m56.623s
    sys 4m13.684s

    CB_UNITY_BUILD=ON
    real    5m31.037s
    user    57m12.170s
    sys 2m12.738s

33% reduction in real time

Change ep_engine.h

    CB_UNITY_BUILD=OFF
    real    3m25.891s
    user    33m29.549s
    sys 1m23.689s

    CB_UNITY_BUILD=ON
    real    3m6.166s
    user    29m53.216s
    sys 1m2.178s

16% reduction in real time

Experiments with enabling unity for engine_ep_unit_tests and rerunning
the above test didn't yield much further improvement, neither did
increased batching from 8 to 16. A follow-up patch will enable
engine_ep_unit_tests once we have a stable setup on CV.

Line:31, /COMMIT_MSG -> These are nice numbers!

Line:45, /COMMIT_MSG -> Even better 😊

Line:518, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> Probably not worth it given there's only 1 source file here.

Line:23, programs/engine_testapp/CMakeLists.txt -> Wonder if we could just link with memcached_daemon instead and avoid building these ~3 or so source files twice? (Also wouldn't need unity then).

Line:41, protocol/mcbp/CMakeLists.txt -> Worth adding here?

Line:23, programs/engine_testapp/CMakeLists.txt -> I'll take a look, would push as a patch ahead of this so this is just unity enable

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:23, programs/engine_testapp/CMakeLists.txt -> Made this a separate patch and have removed from this series as it's failing on CV only (linker error that I can't repro on OSX).
