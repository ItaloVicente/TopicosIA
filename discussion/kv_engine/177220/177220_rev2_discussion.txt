DESCRIPTION:

MB-51987: Set max_num_shards to 1 for serverless

Set the max_number_shards for Magma to 1 for serverless, as testing
showed no degradation in performance proving at least 4.4K ops/sec per
bucket with 30 buckets in the cluster. It also showed a reduction in
memcached avg RSS of ~100MB.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Were tests done with the default number of bg fetcher tasks too? (max_num_bgfetchers). Did you test read perf with that setting as well?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The test was performed with an 80% read 20% write, with max_num_bgfetchers=0, which is auto configure based of the value of max_num_shards.

    auto configBgFetcherLimit = config.getMaxNumBgfetchers();
    auto bgFetcherLimit = configBgFetcherLimit == 0 ? vbMap.getNumShards()
                                                    : configBgFetcherLimit;

Have you tested with 100% write workloads too? We might be screwing over things like restore/bulk loads/migrations if we can't keep up with this number of shards.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> That's a valid comment, however be aware even for bulk loads we only plan to allow each Bucket to perform 5000 WUs per second (so 5k SETs for 1kB values, or 500 SETS for 10kB values). 

As such, as long as we can still achieve 5000 SETs that should be fine.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> From the CB collects we can see we're doing about the same 17K to 20K set/sec when loading data into the buckets before performing the workload phase. Which should be fairly representative of a bulk load. However, as that's from just one client I've ticked of a test run that should be 100% set workload.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> So having done the 100% SET workload, we see very similar mean ops/sec (probably within error). Though max throughput is decreased by ~18%.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Having done the a single SET test of a single bucket on it's own with a large number of clients (48), we had a mean of 38937 sets/sec and a max of 53661 sets/sec
