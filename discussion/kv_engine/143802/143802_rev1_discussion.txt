DESCRIPTION:

MB-43745: Check for collection existence before updating stats

Ephemeral pageOut uses a VBucket::doCollectionsStats that can
result in an exception if the collection of the paged item
no longer exists. This is fixed by checking the collections
existence before calling any VB::Manifest function which would
throw.
