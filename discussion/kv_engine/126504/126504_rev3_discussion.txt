DESCRIPTION:

MB-38497: Ensure verify_header() uses vbucket's collection manifest

Ensure McbpValidator::verify_header() uses the collection manifest at
the vbucket level. So can ensure that ops are valid against a
their vbucket's manifest as apposed to the global bucket manifest.
If this is not done we can end up in situations where DCP mutations for
a replica vbucket are rejected as the bucket level manifest hasn't been
update yet, but the vbucket's manifest has been.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Line:1852, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> getVbucket may return null if the vbucket is not ours, this code path will need test and return not-my-vbucket as the status - the return type of this function will need adjusting as well as the caller assumes and empty optional means "unknown_collection" - we can change this to return a cb::EngineErrorGetScopeIDResult (see memcached/collections.h) - that struct allows for a status, manifest and scope.

After that we need to be careful in that new error case that we don't log when mcbp_validators returns an error

See this patch for a fix in that area where we were logging unknown collection - http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/126413

Basically mcbp_validators is now exposed to not-my-vbucket errors, which shouldn't result in an logging + audit log call

Patch Set 3:

I’ve not looked at the actual code in detail, but I’m wondering if this is e correct approach. 

Historically the mcbp validators have checked things which are constant with respect to the request - e.g. request syntax, max key length not exceeded. If the validator passes then the executor called which does “semantic” checks under approparaie locks where necessary. 

If we attempt to check collection validity at this stage then it _could_ initially  be valid, but by the time we call into the engine then state may have changed - unless we actually take a collection manifest lock or similar - which feels like big feature creep into mcbp-validators.
