DESCRIPTION:

MB-38497: Ensure verify_header() uses vbucket's collection manifest

Ensure McbpValidator::verify_header() uses the collection manifest at
the vbucket level. So can ensure that ops are valid against a
their vbucket's manifest as apposed to the global bucket manifest.
If this is not done we can end up in situations where DCP mutations for
a replica vbucket are rejected as the bucket level manifest hasn't been
update yet, but the vbucket's manifest has been.

This patch does not change the behaviour of the validation sense that it now checks for the scopeID from the engine level. This has been part of the mcbp validators since the auth changes were introduced. With regards the overall strategy I'm not 100% what the technical reason is for checking at the mcbp level as we do also check scope at the engine level when processing the op. Think it would be useful to have Jim and Trond give their thoughts on this 😊.

We've certainly been over this topic a little previously - the mcbp side of the code isn't neccarily setting out to validate the collection from the operation, mcbp privilege checking has a requirement that the collection and scope ids are supplied so that we can support scope based privileges. Teh validator code was picked as a place to do that and to get the scope you do need a valid collection, so mcbp_validator ends up doing some amount of 'unknown collection' handling, but does not keep the collection state 'locked' and KV itself is still re-locking/re-checking and handling "unknown collection" again.

We have sliding scales of things we could with everything being some kind of compromise

Line:1766, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_test.cc -> maybe add the dairy collection to a different scope just so we're not comparing 0 (which is our favourite intialisation value). Should be simple enough via the CollectionsManifest class - e.g. 

    CollectionsManifest cm;
    cm.add(ScopeEntry::shop1)
            .add(CollectionEntry::vegetable, ScopeEntry::shop1);

Then validate the scope is shop1 scope-id
