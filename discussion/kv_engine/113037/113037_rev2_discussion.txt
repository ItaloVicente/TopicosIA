Line:277, engines/ep/src/connhandler.h -> Probably worth keeping the documentation for these to make it explicit to the reader how they differ.

Line:473, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> This comment is inaccurate I believe (given it's now a try-state, asking prepares is only true for syncReplication, not syncWrites.

Line:1512, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> This is incorrect, right? Consumer /does/ support full sync_replication ?

Line:473, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> Done

Line:1512, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> It does, but full sync_rep is "enable_sync_writes" + "consumer_name" which it will send after it has enabled sync writes

Line:1512, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Gotcha. I thought you'd added a new control message for /just/ sync_writes, but see how it fits together now.
