DESCRIPTION:

MB-35499: Only seqnoAck over an fully established stream

Only seqnoAck as a replica after we have had acknowledgment of the
stream by the producer for a given vbucket. Update
dcp_durability_stream_test.cc to correctly update the DCP stream's state
so that we enable the ability to seqnoAck when testing when seqnoAcks
should be sent and add helper methods to perform state transitions.
Also remove transition from StreamState::Reading to
StreamState::Pending as being valid for a PassiveStream as we never
do this and allows us to treat the Pending state as an unacknowledged
stream by the producer.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> acknowledgement

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> might be worth a quick description of the issue to give the "why" to lead into the "what" :)

Line:465, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> might  be worth folding this into seqnoAckStream to save repeated calls to findStream - it isn't necessarily expensive, but the conn has to do it anyway to dispatch the seqno ack?

Line:193, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> I can see the logic in the move, but FWIW I'm not sure it makes a difference - the seqno ack is pushed to the ready queue, so won't be handled until the next DCPConsumer::step() call.

Line:987, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> should the acceptStream call not do this for you?

Line:1445, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> this might want to go in the test setup to keep it with the stream creation. IIRC this is a mockstream made manually, so its lifecycle might be a bit different.It might be worth checking how mock streams respond to acceptStream - if they handle it correctly then acceptStream in the setUp might better mirror the normal life of a stream? Though there may be a good reason it is the way it is!

Line:1459, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Does processMarker not do this transition for you? Or does the state change again after that and needs to be set to reading again manually?
