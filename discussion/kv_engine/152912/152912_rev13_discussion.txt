DESCRIPTION:

MB-45756: Persist stats at end of EventuallyPersistentEngine::destroy()

Currently during the destruction of an ep-engine bucket we persist a
key "ep_force_shutdown" to stats.json, this value is set to false when
we've had a clean shutdown and true if the shutdown was forced.

This value effects when we decide to generate a new failover table
entry during warmup in Warmup::createVBuckets(), when we've had a
forced shutdown or if the key isn't present in the document. Which is
used to help us identify differing seqno histories between kv nodes.

MB-45756 showed that this wasn't always working in the way it should
have. This would occur if memcached is killed using SIGKILL while it's
in EventuallyPersistentEngine::~EventuallyPersistentEngine().
As ~EventuallyPersistentEngine() is responsible for shutting the
flusher it takes a non insignificant amount of time to complete and if
killed when flushing could leave the node in an inconsistent state with
its replica. As in the case of MB-45756, where the active was at
seqno:Y when it was killed but only persisted to X. So when it came
back up the at seqno:X it was behind replica at seqno:Y. But due to
expiry we generated enough seqnos to have a high seqno > Y. Causing us
to having differing histories but not causing us to roll back the
replica.

To fix this we have refactored
EventuallyPersistentEngine::destroyInner() &
~EventuallyPersistentEngine(), so that destroyInner() takes over the
responsibility of deinitialize() the KVBucket and freeing its memory.
Which intern will insure we shutdown the flushers safely.
destroyInner() collects the stats to be persisted before we
shutdown the flushers and DCP connections. But will now persist the
stats to stats.json after the flushers have finished and we have a
consistent state on disk. That way if we crash at any point before
we'll have never inserted a "ep_force_shutdown" key in the document (as
ep_force_shutdown is only ever written during shutdown).

This patch also covers a case where we crash during Warmup after we
modify the state on disk, but before the StatSnap task runs (which
removes the 'ep_force_shutdown' from stats.log). As the next time we
Warmup we want to create a new failover table entry as we didn't
shutdown cleanly and our history could have diverged from our replicas.
To cover this case we set 'ep_force_shutdown=true' in
Warmup::populateVBucketMap() as we may flush items to disk during this
phase of warmup and also allow streaming from active vbuckets. This flag
with then be removed once StatSnap task runs at the end of warmup.

Line:2119, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> probably worth commenting this to mention that this is where the flusher is getting stopped as we comment on it later when we write stats

Line:1304, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> I know Dave suggested this so not saying it should be changed... personally think the original style of writing the stats without force_shutdown after we read them was simpler and isolated the stats doc changes making it easier to reason about.


Actual question(s) though: Is snapshotting stats thread safe? You'll be calling this from from multiple threads. Does the stats snapshot code not need to change? It just logs on failure at the moment which would leave us open to issues if it did fail and subsequent flushes worked.

Line:2120, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> As per call, I think we can just move this down to here, and revert all the getSnapshotStats / writeSnapshotStats changes:

    if (kvBucket) {
        kvBucket->snapshotStats();
        snapStats = kvBucket->getSnapshotStats();
    }

Line:1304, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Discussed with Richard - agree it's better to do this in ::initialise() - that also avoids any threading issues.

Line:2487, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> Comment at line 2489 should be moved to refer to this line now.

Line:437, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Suggest making this std::optional.

Line:2519, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> ASSERT... (as they are checking preconditions for the test, not the actual test itself)

(and below).

Line:2526, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> Nit: can be const.

Line:2539, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> .. "forced shutdown"?

Line:2576, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> Should also check it's not the same one at step 4 - i.e. create a second 'secondFailoverEntry' var; and check it's not the same as either.

Line:2590, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> ASSERT also.
