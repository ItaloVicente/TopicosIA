DESCRIPTION:

MB-45756: Persist stats at end of EventuallyPersistentEngine::destroy()

Currently during the destruction of an ep-engine bucket we persist a key
"ep_force_shutdown" to stats.json, this value is set to false when we've
had a clean shutdown and true if the shutdown was forced.

This value affects when we decide to generate a new failover table entry
during warmup in Warmup::createVBuckets(), when we've had a forced
shutdown or if the key isn't present in the document. Which is used to
help us identify differing seqno histories between kv nodes.

MB-45756 showed that this wasn't always working in the way it should
have. This would occur if memcached is killed using SIGKILL while its
while its in EventuallyPersistentEngine::~EventuallyPersistentEngine().
As ~EventuallyPersistentEngine() is responsible for shutting the flusher
it takes a non insignificant amount of time to complete and if killed
when flushing could leave the node in an inconsistent with its replica.
As in the case of MB-45756, where the active was at seqno:Y when it was
killed but only persisted to X. So when it came back up the at seqno:X
it was behind replica at seqno:Y. But due to expiry we generated enough
seqnos to have a high seqno > Y. Causing us to having differing
histories but not causing us to roll back the replica.

To fix this we should gather the stats that we want to persist to disk
during EventuallyPersistentEngine::destroy(), before we call
EventuallyPersistentEngine::~EventuallyPersistentEngine(). Then after
the dtor of EventuallyPersistentEngine has run we then finally persist
the stats to disk. That way if we crash at any point before we'll have
never inserted a "ep_force_shutdown" key in the document (as
ep_force_shutdown is only ever written during shutdown).

We also need to ensure that we remove the key "ep_force_shutdown" from
stats.json if we find it and its false. As if we get killed/crash during
warmup then we should be aware of this. During warmup however, this
should only be done once we get to a stage where we're going to start
modifying a vbuckets history.
