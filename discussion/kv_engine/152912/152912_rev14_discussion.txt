DESCRIPTION:

MB-45756: Persist snapshot stats after the flusher has been stopped

Currently during the destruction of an ep-engine bucket we persist a
key "ep_force_shutdown" to stats.json, this value is set to false when
we've had a clean shutdown and true if the shutdown was forced.

This value effects when we decide to generate a new failover table
entry during warmup in Warmup::createVBuckets(), when we've had a
forced shutdown or if the key isn't present in the document. Which is
used to help us identify differing seqno histories between kv nodes.

MB-45756 showed that this wasn't always working in the way it should
have. This would occur if memcached is killed using SIGKILL while it's
in EventuallyPersistentEngine::~EventuallyPersistentEngine().
As ~EventuallyPersistentEngine() is responsible for shutting the
flusher it takes a non insignificant amount of time to complete and if
killed when flushing could leave the node in an inconsistent state with
its replica. As in the case of MB-45756, where the active was at
seqno:Y when it was killed but only persisted to X. So when it came
back up the at seqno:X it was behind replica at seqno:Y. But due to
expiry we generated enough seqnos to have a high seqno > Y. Causing us
to having differing histories but not causing us to roll back the
replica.

To fix this we have refactored
EventuallyPersistentEngine::destroyInner() & EPBucket::deinitialize(),
so that the responsibility to take a snapshot of stats and persist it
is performed by EPBucket::deinitialize() just after the flushers have
been stopped. Meaning we have a consistent state on disk. That way if 
we crash at any point before we'll have never inserted a 
"ep_force_shutdown" key in the document (as ep_force_shutdown is only
ever written during shutdown).

~EventuallyPersistentEngine() & destroyInner() has been refactored to 
now takes over the responsibility of deinitialize() the KVBucket and 
freeing its memory. To allow for easier testing of this fix.

This patch also covers a case where we crash during Warmup after we
modify the state on disk, but before the StatSnap task runs (which
removes the 'ep_force_shutdown' from stats.log). As the next time we
Warmup we want to create a new failover table entry as we didn't
shutdown cleanly and our history could have diverged from our replicas.
To cover this case we set 'ep_force_shutdown=true' in
Warmup::initialize() as we may flush items to disk during this phase
of warmup and also allow streaming from active vbuckets. This flag
with then be removed once StatSnap task runs at the end of warmup.

Line:1264, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h -> Nit: Can get a bit confusing if we keep flipping between visibility mode in a class defn. Prefer to just put this in the existing public section.

Line:984, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> I think we need to consider this failing due to some transient disk error (perhaps in a followup?). If it were to then we'd potentially not create new failover table entries if the warmup in which we couldn't persist the new stats falied due to some crash.

Line:984, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Good spot. For now we could simply call it in a loop (say with a 1s sleep between attempts + log message).

Line:984, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Fair point :), though think that's more about making KVStore::snapshotStats() more resilient? And would probably want to be done in a follow up patch, given it would also need its own tests. 
Also think we would need to decide what we would want to do in the situation of failure:
1. How many times should we re-try?
2. If we consistently fail is it valid that we abort warmup? This could happen if the disk was full for instance.
