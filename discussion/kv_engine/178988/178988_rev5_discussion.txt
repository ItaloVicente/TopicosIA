DESCRIPTION:

MB-53304: Enforce holding of stateLock in VBucket::queueItem [3/3]

MB-53304 suggests we ensure that the stateLock is held by passing a ref
to it in queueItem (and the call hierarchy of queueItem).

This patch is the last of the series and refactors all code paths to
pass this ref to the lock as a `VBucketStateLockRef`.
