DESCRIPTION:

MB-36650: Ephemeral Replica resilient to unprepared Abort

In MB-35633 we started with processing (rather than ignoring) Abort
messages at Replica in the case where the related Prepare has never been
received. That may happen for both EP and Ephemeral bucket when Replica
receives a Backfill snapshot (as Active can deduplicate Prepare and
Abort).

With MB-35633 we cover two cases:
1) "key" does not exist in the HashTable when Replica receives the
  unprepared Abort
2) a nornal mutation for "key" is in the HastTable when the unprepared
  Abort is processed

This patch covers the third (and missing) case: a Completed (Committed /
Aborted) Prepare exists in the HashTable when the unprepared Abort is
processed, which can happen for Ephemeral.

Note that the tests added in this patch spotted the issue in MB-36735
(EP bucket issue when the unprepared Abort is received and the Completed
Prepare is Level::PersistToMajority and is still tracked in the
PassiveDM). The tests covering that case are temporarily disabled.
