DESCRIPTION:

MB-36650: Ephemeral Replica resilient to unprepared Abort

In MB-35633 we started with processing (rather than ignoring) Abort
messages at Replica in the case where the related Prepare has never been
received. That may happen for both EP and Ephemeral bucket when Replica
receives a Backfill snapshot (as Active can deduplicate Prepare and
Abort).

With MB-35633 we cover two cases:
1) "key" does not exist in the HashTable when Replica receives the
  unprepared Abort
2) a nornal mutation for "key" is in the HastTable when the unprepared
  Abort is processed

This patch covers the third (and missing) case: a Completed (Committed /
Aborted) Prepare exists in the HashTable when the unprepared Abort is
processed, which can happen for Ephemeral.

Note that this patch adds full test-coverage for unprepared Abort for
both EP and Ephemeral. Some tests for EP spotted the issue in MB-36735
(EP bucket issue when the unprepared Abort is received and the Completed
Prepare is Level::PersistToMajority and is still tracked in the
PassiveDM). The tests covering that case are temporarily disabled.

Line:970, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Note about removing this check:

1) by definition, htRes.pending can be only committed-state-pending or committed-state-completed

2) the case committed-state-completed is caught in the block above, where we also check if we are receiving a disk snapshot

3) the case committed-state-pending must be processed below, where we don't care whether we are processing a disk or memory snapshot

So, the check is redundant.

LGTM. Good to get some more eyes on this - BenH / JamesH could you take a look?

Code looks good, just a couple of minor test things
Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> HashTable

Line:3426, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> ephemeral should not accept these. Might be that the check only exists on active though

Line:3436, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Same as above

Line:3447, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> same as above

Line:3457, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> same as above

Line:158, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.h -> this already exists in the active stream tests (and in a bunch of other files) could you just move/re-use the active stream one?

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:3426, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Yeah, we could (1) skip these tests for Ephemeral or (2) keep them, turn them into an EXPECT_THROW (or whatever) and enabling them once we add the check at Replica.
Proceeding the second way (here and below).

Line:158, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.h -> You're right.
But, we don't have a base DurabilityStreamTest currently (where we should move this enum and other things possibly), I prefer not to add to much noise in this patch if you're ok with that.
