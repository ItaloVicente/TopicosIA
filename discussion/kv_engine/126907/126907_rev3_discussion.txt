DESCRIPTION:

MB-37319: Extend snapshot marker with a timestamp

The timestamp is only present in disk snapshots, and represents
the timestamp for the committed header on disk (which would
represent the Point in Time to use for recovery)

NOTE: The server will NOT accept receiving the new format with
this patch (as it will only be sent (in the future) when someone
requests the timestamp to be present)

Line:74, daemon/protocol/mcbp/dcp_snapshot_marker_codec.cc -> Here we are assuming that we never expect (timestamp & maxVisibleSeqno), is that what we want?

Is it possible that backup disables SyncRepl but enables PiT ? If yes, then we may have (timestamp & maxVisibleSeqno) if my understanding is correct..

Line:74, daemon/protocol/mcbp/dcp_snapshot_marker_codec.cc -> How did you come to that conclusion? If a timestamp _is_ provided we need to use the V2,1 encoding which is a superset of v2.0, If we don't have a timestamp we have to use V2.0 if maxVisibleSeqno and/or highCompletedSeqno is provided. If none of those fields are provided we may use the simplest encoding of the message.
