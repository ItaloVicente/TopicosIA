DESCRIPTION:

MB-36510: Use NonBucketAllocationGuard for trace allocations

Move the various trace helpers to ep-engine and use the
guard to protect the calls which may cause allocations to
happen when operating on the trace data structures

Line:28, daemon/protocol/mcbp/engine_wrapper.cc -> Seems like this change (and the next header one) should be in the previous patch...

Line:51, engines/ep/src/trace_helpers.h -> Note: This shouldn't be necessary, given end() doesn't allocate anything (it just locates the previously created element from start().

(NonBucketAllocationGuard ctor and dtor both to a TLS item switch, which can be non-trivial cost if in hot paths...)

Line:91, engines/ep/src/trace_helpers.h -> You should update the comment to explain the trace event is only recorded when the stopwatch is destructed (given that's a change in behaviour from previous).

File Comment: tracing/tracing_bench.cc -> Please don't remove this file - the benchmarks were useful to tune the performance of tracing - it's was necessary to optimise quite a bit to not impact front-end ops.

Line:28, daemon/protocol/mcbp/engine_wrapper.cc -> This can go in the previous one (it doesn't really matter.. its a leftover from some times earlier.. it was never used). For others the file was moved over to ep-engine..

Line:51, engines/ep/src/trace_helpers.h -> Done

Line:91, engines/ep/src/trace_helpers.h -> Done

File Comment: tracing/tracing_bench.cc -> Done
