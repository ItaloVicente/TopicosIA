DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Collections test abstractions

Upcoming changes to Collections (ID and schema) will mean
lots of churn for the Manifest JSON format and code which wants to
identify collections (e.g. .exists("beer")).

This patch adds some abstractions so that tests don't need to embed
raw JSON or use raw "name" when testing for a collection. This will allow
future commits to more easily change the JSON manifest format and
for tests to change more easily from name identification to ID just by
updating the abstractions.

Change-Id: I0a8b4c7436d5a5d1483ab9d20a63f42d36445722
