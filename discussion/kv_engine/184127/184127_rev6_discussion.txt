DESCRIPTION:

MB-54729: Refactor ScanContext to use uint64_t for sequence numbers

KV does not place negative sequence numbers in the sequence index, so
a ScanContext can use unsigned types when storing sequence numbers.

This makes upstream changes cleaner as we don't mix signed/unsigned
anymore.

Note: RocksDB has 1 special case where a negative seqno is used, hence
it retains the signed getSeqnoSlice function. Note that the special
case is not related to scans.
