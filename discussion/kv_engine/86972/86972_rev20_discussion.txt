DESCRIPTION:

MB-27063: Add config flag to enable / disable filtering

Add a global configuration option "filtering_enabled" which if set to
true allows audit events to be filtered by user (from real_userid or
effective_userid).

The option is is required to be defined in version 2 of the audit
configuration (similar to the diabled_users list).

Also adds an associated test.
