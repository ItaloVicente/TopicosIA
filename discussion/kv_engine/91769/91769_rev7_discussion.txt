DESCRIPTION:

MB-28777: Provide a max_compression_ratio configuration parameter

If there isn't much difference between sizes of compressed and
uncompressed data, then decompressing the data every time for
a client would outweigh the cost of storing the data as
compressed as there is no perceivable benefit in space savings

Line:200, daemon/protocol/mcbp/engine_wrapper.cc -> I'm not sure if we really want to add a trace scope for calling a getter on a member from the engine. Adding a trace scope involves reading the clock at least two times, and it might also involve memory allocation. I'm guessing that the value returned here would be more or less constant (the thread _might_ be suspended, but that might also happen right after the clock was read and before the value is inserted into the trace scope so I think this scope is of limited value.

Line:235, engines/default_engine/default_engine.cc -> Why do we have a different default value in configuration.json

Line:882, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Add max?

Line:1815, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> This is a different default value than in configuration.json..

Line:882, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Given that a compressed value can be greater than an uncompressed value, the ratio in such a case could be greater than 1.0, but there isn't a specified limit, hence not specifying a max value.
