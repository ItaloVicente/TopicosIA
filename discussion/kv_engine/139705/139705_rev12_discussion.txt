DESCRIPTION:

MB-42282 magma-kvstore: Use disk snapshot for bySeqno scan

The bySeqno iterator requires the snapshot to be held for the duration
of the scan. The default snapshot holds inmemory memtables at that
point-in-time as part of the snapshot. This results in signficant memory usage
if the snapshot needs to be held for a longer duration.

This issue can be resolved by forcing writecache flush for the
kvstore and obtain the diskonly snapshot for performing bySeqno scan.
