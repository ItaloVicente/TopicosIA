DESCRIPTION:

MB-27769: BufferLog: add range checks to bytesOutstanding & acked

Change the types of ackedBytes to be Monotonic<> - it should never go
backwards.

Similary for bytesOutstanding - change it to NonNegativeCounter. Note
that bytesOutstanding was previously named bytesSent; however that's
somewhat misleading as it impled (to me at least) a total amount sent,
not the current anount outstanding.

Check that we don't try to acknowledge more bytes than are outstanding
(in release_UNLOCKED) - throw a logic_error if that is the case.
