DESCRIPTION:

[cbsasl] Add SCRAM-ARGON2ID

There isn't an RFC for this so I just hacked around the
SCRAM-SHA[x] ones and added the following parameter
from the server to the client:

   m=<m_cost>

Then the client use argon2id 1.3 with the provided cost parameters
and salt to generate the digest. The other validations with the
hashing of the messages use HMAC with SHA-512.
