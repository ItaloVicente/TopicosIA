DESCRIPTION:

[cbsasl] Add SCRAM-ARGON2ID

There isn't an RFC for this so I just hacked around the
SCRAM-SHA[x] ones and added the following parameters
from the server to the client:

   t=<t_cost>
   m=<m_cost>
   C=<parallelism>

Then the client use argon2id with the provided cost parameters
and salt to generate the digest. The other validations with the
hasing of the messages use HMAC with SHA-512.
