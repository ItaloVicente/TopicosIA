DESCRIPTION:

MB-42224: Add test for sync-header failures at KVStore::snapshotVBucket

Current opinion is that we have nothing to fix in the
KVStore::snapshotVBucket code path with regard to sync-header failures.

The test shows that the major side-effect of a sync-failure is that the
new vbstate is visible if the user makes a call to
KVStore::getPersistedVBucketState(), while the cached vbstate stays
correctly untouched.

Given that KVStore::getPersistedVBucketState() is a test-only API and
that all prod code in KV uses KVStore::getCachedVBucketState(), then we
are fine.
