DESCRIPTION:

MB-27769: DCP Producer: Ensure totalAckedBytes <= totalSendBytes

We shouldn't receive acknowledgement of more bytes than we have
actually sent out - this would be a sign that flow control is
broken. However in the listed MB we /did/ see this scenario - e.g.

     total_acked_bytes:                       1186466164
     total_bytes_sent:                        1186087331

Check that we haven't acked more than we have sent; and if so log a
warning and return ENGINE_DISCONNECT.

Line:684, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Isn't this too harsh ? Some DCP clients may get reprimanded severely for this accounting error.
Currently, if they ack more than they receive, worst case they maybe overrun by items from producer, and they still have a chance to handle it.

Unnecessary - see below comments.
Line:684, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> I did debate this - I had a previous version which just warned. 

The main reason why I decide to make it disconnect was to highlight any issues with clients - if we disconnect it's much more likely we'll spot the issue in testing.

How about we line up a patch to go into Vulcan after Beta, which removes the disconnect - that way we'll get the benefit of the explicit error; but not when we GA ?

Having said all this, this patch is probably redundant - http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/88768/ essentially results in the same check (in DcpProducer::BufferLog::release_UNLOCKED) so I can just drop this patch.

As an aside; tried running simple-test and hit a number of occurrences of this - e.g.:

 memcached.log.000002.txt:2018-02-02T17:43:40.424121Z WARNING 142: exception occurred in runloop - closing connection: DcpProducer::BufferLog: attempting to release 209764 bytes which is greater than 202671
