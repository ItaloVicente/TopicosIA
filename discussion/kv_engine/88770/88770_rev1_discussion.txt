DESCRIPTION:

MB-27769: DCP Producer: Ensure totalAckedBytes <= totalSendBytes

We shouldn't receive acknowledgement of more bytes than we have
actually sent out - this would be a sign that flow control is
broken. However in the listed MB we /did/ see this scenario - e.g.

     total_acked_bytes:                       1186466164
     total_bytes_sent:                        1186087331

Check that we haven't acked more than we have sent; and if so log a
warning and return ENGINE_DISCONNECT.
