DESCRIPTION:

MB-27661 [n/n]: Fix MSVC warnings - C4273, C2491

C4273 - function : inconsistent DLL linkage. Two definitions in a file
        differ in their use of dllimport.
C2491 - identifier' : definition of dllimport function not allowed

Introduce a new file to handle the API header imports/exports
correctly on MSVC when using the same file for both libraries
and executables.

This is the final commit in the fix all the MSVC compiler warnings
sequence. We can now re-enable Windows build verfication compiler
warnings to report on Gerrit patches.
