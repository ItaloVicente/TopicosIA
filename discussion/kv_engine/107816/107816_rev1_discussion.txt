DESCRIPTION:

MB-33788 [SR]: Ensure persist-to-active for Level=PersistToMajority

Currently the Active is not included in Majority for Level
PersistToMajority, which is wrong. E.g.:

- 2 replicas
- chain: {A, R1, R2}
- write{level=PersistToMajority}
- R1 and R2 persist it and ack back to A
- Majority reached -> write satisfied and committed to client
- A crashes and restarts, before persisting

With the sequence above we have broken the contract with the client.
To fix, we always include the Active in Majority for PersistToMajority.
