DESCRIPTION:

MB-35133: Move SyncWrite warmup to EPBucket

We want to re-use the SyncWrite warmup code when performing a
rollback as it's simpler than trying to write code to revert
every possible state to the pre-rollback state. Move the
loadPreparedSyncWrites code to EPBucket so that we can re-use it
for rollback.
