DESCRIPTION:

MB-45066: Migrate off "default bucket" logic in testapp [1/3]

The "default bucket" logic was deprecated in 7.0, and we want to
delete it.

This patch change (most) of the unit tests to authenticate as the
user "Luke" and select the bucket named "default" before using
the connection.

This adds 2 extra roundtrips to the server (PLAIN auth is being
used, and then an explicit bucket selection) every time we call
getConnection().

As a follow-up to this commit we should look into keeping the
connections in each test case and reuse the connection, but that
should be handled as a separate task.

NOTE: this patch does NOT remove the "default bucket" logic and it
is being used by the tests which isn't moved over to use the
MemcachedConnection class.
