DESCRIPTION:

MB-42352: allow_del_with_meta_prune_user_data true by default

Pre-6.6 versions are affected by invalid payloads generated by
expirations. Ie, body or user-xattrs in the value.
6.6.0 fixes that. But, users of DelWithMeta may still fail validation
when they want to store pre-6.6 data into a 6.6 node. Eg,
backup/restore and XDCR.

Since MB-36321 DelWithMeta can operate in a "sanitizer" mode that is off
by default. This patch enables it, so any invalid payload will be
sanitized and successfully stored in 6.6.

The feature seems to have already a decent test coverage, introduced in
http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/115904/ first and then in
http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/129191.
