DESCRIPTION:

MB-25173: Run (explicitly) functional compaction tests only in ep buckets

Functional compaction tests were disabled temporarily in Ephemeral
buckets during development. This commit explicitly runs those tests
in ep buckets only. The functionality associated with compaction,
like tombstone purging, is run in module tests of ephemeral
buckets.
