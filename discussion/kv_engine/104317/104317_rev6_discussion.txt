DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Modify connection limit handling

Modified the check in the packet validation phase to only
look at unathenticated connections. Whenever we fill up the
"user" available section of the connections we start refusing
clients to run other commands than the commands used in the
authentication phase.

As part of authentication we perform an extra check to see
the client authenticate as an internal user or not (and check
the appropriate limit).
