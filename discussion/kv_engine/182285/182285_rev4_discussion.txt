DESCRIPTION:

MB-53053: Allow buckets in the Ready state to be kept alive

Add a new `tryAssociateBucket` to the ServerBucketIface that will
allow us to safely interact with buckets outside of the bucket's own
context. Without a way to keep the bucket alive, there is no safe way
to schedule a task or get buckets stats for another bucket.

We want to be able to do this so that we can orchestrate ItemPager
across buckets sharing memory quota.
