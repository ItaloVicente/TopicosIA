DESCRIPTION:

MB-29822: Log disconnections on DCP operations

A disconnection caused by the underlying engine returning
ENGINE_DISCONNECT is currently logged in the proxy function in
engine_erapper.h.
As the DCP executors in memcached do not go through the engine_wrapper.h
functions, we miss logging disconnections caused by ENGINE_DISCONNECT on
DCP operations.
With this patch we redirect all the DCP executors to engine_wrapper.h
and we log the disconnection in there.
