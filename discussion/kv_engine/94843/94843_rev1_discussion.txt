DESCRIPTION:

MB-29822 [1/n] Log disconnections on DCP operations

A disconnection caused by the underlying engine returning
ENGINE_DISCONNECT is currently logged in the proxy function is
engine_erapper.h.
As the DCP executors in memcached do not go through the engine_wrapper.h
functions, we miss to log disconnections caused by ENGINE_DISCONNECT on
DCP operations.
With this patch we redirect all the DCP executors to engine_wrapper.h
and we log the disconnection in there.

Line:349, daemon/protocol/mcbp/engine_wrapper.cc -> I've kept LOG_INFO so far because the existing functions do that, but I would upgrade the log level to WARNING everywhere here.
What do you think?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> in

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> New line here?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> miss logging

Line:349, daemon/protocol/mcbp/engine_wrapper.cc -> Log warning sounds good here I think, assuming we do not expect ENGINE_DISCONNECT as part of usual operation
