DESCRIPTION:

MB-26887: Move to bufferevent [1/7]

This patch moves the memcached core over to using bufferevents
for it's network layer (with or without SSL).

To reduce the size of the patch we've disabled some functionality:

* Disable fair sharing by backing off after processing n
  events

  This means that a single connection may starve the other
  connections unless it runs out of data in the input queue
  or the underlying engine needs to block.

  This will be enabled once the state machine is modified
  after the complete move to bufferevents

* Disable idle timers

  This means that we won't disconnect normal clients if they're
  staying idle for more than X seconds.

In addition to that no changes has been performed to the
input/output buffer used by memcached in order to keep
the patch as small as possible.

This means that libevent will read data into its buffers,
then memcached will copy the data into its own buffers
before using it (and the same happens when sending data).
This will be cleaned up in the next set of patches.
