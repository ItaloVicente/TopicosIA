DESCRIPTION:

MB-35192: Persist the max HPS and HCS seen when flushing

EPBucket::flushVBucket calls rwUnderlying->optimizeWrites(items); which
may reorder items before committing to disk. As they are no longer
sorted by seqno, we cannot rely on the latest HPS and HCS seen to also
be the highest.
This could lead to an incorrect HPS and HCS after warming up.

Change-Id: Ia813610cad8ab771c2cd6797cf7f0a0601d032b1
Solution: track the highest seen values.

Line:419, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> There's a lot going on in this expression now. Not sure the boost::optional is the most helpful way of implementing this now. What about just using a vanilla int64_t which is initialised above to -1; then you can just do `max(hcs, item->getPrepareSeqno())` here?

(And change where it's read below to check against -1).

Line:423, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> ditto

Line:419, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Indeed - this is a but messy. I have a version with the change as suggested, but what do you think to the method in the new patch? If -1 is still preferable I'll flip it over to that.
