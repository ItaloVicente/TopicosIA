DESCRIPTION:

MB-35192: Persist the max HPS and HCS seen when flushing

EPBucket::flushVBucket calls rwUnderlying->optimizeWrites(items); which
may reorder items before committing to disk. As they are no longer
sorted by seqno, we cannot rely on the latest HPS and HCS seen to also
be the highest.
This could lead to an incorrect HPS and HCS after warming up.

Solution: track the highest seen values.
