DESCRIPTION:

MB-37013: Update DcpSnapShotMarker V2 to allow for an extra seqno

To address MB-36948 a new seqno is required in the snapshot marker.

This commit redefines the V2 format so that the V2 extras is a single
version field (1 byte). The 1 byte version field is used to describe how
the packet is to be decoded, in this MB one V2 encoding is created.

V2.0: The 'value' stores all of the snapshot marker data.
* start (u64)
* end (u64)
* flags (u32)
* maxVisibleSeqno (u64)
* highCompletedSeqno (u64)

With this commit only the V1 and V2.0 encodings are transmitted, but the
V2.0 encoding is only currently transmitted for snapshots with the disk
flag set (and when a sync write has occurred in the vbucket). Because
there is no path yet for the DcpProducer to push down the
maxVisibleSeqno, with this commit V2.0 always transmits 0 for the
maxVisibleSeqno.

Note on removal of the following from dcp_snapshot_marker_executor.cc

  // HCS should never be sent as 0 or a pre-condition will throw in
  // the replicas flusher
  if (v2Payload->getHighCompletedSeqno() == 0) {
      // Not success so just disconnect
      connection.setState(StateMachine::State::closing);
      return;
  }

This disconnect clause is no longer required because analysis of the
ActiveStream::markDiskSnapshot shows that it would never push down a 0
HCS to the  Connection::marker send code.

Extended testing of the committed patch was performed using a multi
node cluster and various failover/rebalance steps to check the
disk-snapshot with the v2.0 encoding was transmitted and successfully
received.

Note: further testing was performed where the Connection::marker local
'maxVisibleSeqno' was initialised to a value to confirm that if all
snapshots used the V2.0 encoding, there is no issue.

Code looks good. A number of Nits but none of them functionally affect the code (just comments, docs etc) so happy for this to go in as-is (with follow-up patch to cleanup the Nits later).
Line:49, daemon/protocol/mcbp/dcp_snapshot_marker_codec.cc -> Nit: Potentially slightly misleading now, it's always sent, just unused if not disk.

Line:84, daemon/protocol/mcbp/dcp_snapshot_marker_codec.h -> Nit: v2.1 no longer present (can go in a follow-up patch).

Line:9, docs/dcp/documentation/commands/snapshot-marker.md -> Nit: Can drop the ".x" now.

Line:736, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Can this be removed now?

Line:196, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.cc -> Same - can this be removed now?

Line:866, include/memcached/protocol_binary.h -> Nit: Not strictly necessary as `int` is the default representation type for an enum, but given we rely on the size might be worth adding an explicit `: int`

Line:736, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> actually this one is a bug if left unchanged - if we receieve the v2 packet, but hcs isn't set we are setting bytes to be the v1 packet, we'll under-ack and eventually the producer will cut us of! Fix exists, just needs squashing in

Line:196, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.cc -> will change as per other comment (will squash upstream patch)
