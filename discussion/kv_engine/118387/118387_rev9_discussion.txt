DESCRIPTION:

MB-37013: Update DcpSnapShotMarker V2 to allow for an extra seqno

MB-37013 identified that to address MB-36948 a new seqno is required in
the snapshot marker.

This commit redefines the V2 format so that the V2 extras is a single
version field (1 byte). The 1 byte version field is used to describe how
the packet is to be decoded, in this MB one V2 encoding is created.

V2.0: The 'value' stores all of the snapshot marker data.
* start (u64)
* end (u64)
* flags (u32)
* maxVisibleSeqno (u64)
* highCompletedSeqno (u64)

With this commit only the V1 and V2.0 encodings are transmitted, but the
V2.0 encoding is only ever transmitted for disk snapshots (when a sync
write has occurred). Because there is no path yet for the caller to
define the maxVisibleSeqno, V2.0 always transmits 0 for the max visible
seqno.

Extended testing of the committed patch was performed using a multi
node cluster and various failover/rebalance steps to check the
disk-snapshot with the v2.0 encoding was transmitted and successfully
received.

Note: further testing was performed where the Connection::marker local
'maxVisibleSeqno' was initialised to a value so that all the memory
snapshots used the V2.0 encoding.

All testing packet captures were used and the on-wire encodings checked.
