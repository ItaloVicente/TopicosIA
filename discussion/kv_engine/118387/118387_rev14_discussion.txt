DESCRIPTION:

MB-37013: Update DcpSnapShotMarker V2 to allow for an extra seqno

This commit redefines the V2 format so that the V2 extras is only a
version field (1 byte). The 1 byte version field is used to describe how
the packet is to be decoded, in this MB two V2 encodings are created.

V2.0: The 'value' stores all of the snapshot marker data.
* start (u64)
* end (u64)
* flags (u32)
* maxVisibleSeqno (u64)

V2.1: The 'value' stores all of the snapshot marker data.
* start (u64)
* end (u64)
* flags (u32)
* maxVisibleSeqno (u64)
* highCompletedSeqno (u64)

With this commit only the V1 and V2.1 encodings are transmitted because
there is no path yet for the caller to define the maxVisibleSeqno. When
the V2.1 encoding is used, the maxVisibleSeqno field is set to 0.

Note: extended testing was performed where the Connection::marker local
'maxVisibleSeqno' was initialised to a value so that all the memory
snapshots used the V2.0 encoding.

Additionally testing of the committed patch was performed using a multi
node cluster and various failover/rebalance steps to check the
disk-snapshot with the v2.1 encoding was transmitted and successfully
received.

All testing packet captures were used and the on-wire encodings checked.

patchset 9 vs patchset 14? Patchset 14 is now the 'chosen' version because of further issues with 9 that would need more work elsewhere... details follow

patchset 9? This reduced down the encodings to just V2 (no 2.0/2.1) and V1, here we always sent the maxVisibleSeqno as 0.

patchset 14 here 3 encodings exist, v1 and v2.0/v2.1

I tested with the 'simpler' patch 9 but ran into trouble when simulating the upstream changes which would include a real maxVisibleSeqno for in-memory snapshots. The problem was DCP disconnects because the in-memory path currently doesn't setup the HCS, so the V2 encoding sent my 'valid' max-visible-seqno, but 0 for HCS, we have an error case which disconnects if a snapshot sent a 0 HCS.

DCP disconnect for a 0 HCS -> http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/mad-hatter/kv_engine/daemon/protocol/mcbp/dcp_snapshot_marker_executor.cc#46
HCS not defined -> http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/mad-hatter/kv_engine/engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc#1174

Note the latter (ActiveStream) problem is being fixed by Paolo's patch for MB-36971 (http://review.couchbase.org/118350).

I did look at that and there's still a path where hcs is not defined
