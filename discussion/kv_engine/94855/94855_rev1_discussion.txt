DESCRIPTION:

MB-29822 [2/n] Always log disconnections in memcached

Except for when a connection is closed after a clean shutdown (i.e.,
connection closed by peer), we always want to log the reason why a
connection is being disconnected in memcached.

Line:236, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> This should probably be LOG_DEBUG as this is the requested operation for the command, and we don't typically log that at the INFO level

Line:244, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> ditto

Line:939, daemon/memcached.cc -> this is already logged

Line:945, daemon/memcached.cc -> Why is this a warning? is this something an administrator needs to look at?

Line:189, daemon/protocol/mcbp/get_cmd_timer_executor.cc -> this should be moved to get_cmd_timer() (before we remap the error)

Line:99, daemon/protocol/mcbp/list_bucket_executor.cc -> move to list_bucket()

Line:79, daemon/protocol/mcbp/select_bucket_executor.cc -> move to select_bucket

Line:473, daemon/statemachine_mcbp.cc -> isn't this also used by let's say the quit executor? I would have expected us to already have logged the failure scenario, and then inject the error message to send back to the client before shutting down the connection. This message just seems to add yet another entry (and at a warning level.. which means that there should be something the admininstrator should be looking at and trying to resolve...)

Line:570, daemon/subdocument.cc -> This should already have been logged in bucket_get, shouldn't it?

Line:236, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> Done

Line:244, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> Done

Line:939, daemon/memcached.cc -> Done

Line:945, daemon/memcached.cc -> Done

Line:189, daemon/protocol/mcbp/get_cmd_timer_executor.cc -> I would prefer to keep this in this patch, as the execution tree in get_cmd_timer() is pretty complex.
Maybe we can refactor this source file in a dedicated patch?

Line:99, daemon/protocol/mcbp/list_bucket_executor.cc -> list_bucket() cannot return ENGINE_DISCONNECT, only remapErrorCode() can return it. That is already logged, so removing this

Line:79, daemon/protocol/mcbp/select_bucket_executor.cc -> select_bucket() cannot return ENGINE_DISCONNECT, only remapErrorCode() can return it. That is already logged, so removing this

Line:473, daemon/statemachine_mcbp.cc -> Correct. I have already logged when we call setWriteAndGo(closing), so removing this

Line:570, daemon/subdocument.cc -> Yes, or logged in remapErrorCode. Also, the 'ret' argument in input can be only SUCCESS or EWOULDBLOCK, so removing this

Line:1008, daemon/subdocument.cc -> validate_xattr_privilege() cannot return ENGINE_DISCONNECT. That can only come from remapErrorCode(), where it is already logged. So removing this

Line:1294, daemon/subdocument.cc -> The return value of bucket_allocate_ex() is re-mapped to something different than ENGINE_DISCONNECT. 
Also, remapErrorCode() already logs if it sets ENGINE_DISCONNECT. 
Also, the 'ret' argument in input can be only SUCCESS or EWOULDBLOCK.
So removing this.

Line:1399, daemon/subdocument.cc -> Already logged in bucket_remove/bucket_store/remapErrorCode.
Removing
