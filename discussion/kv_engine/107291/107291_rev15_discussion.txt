DESCRIPTION:

MB-33599: Allow dynamic reconfig of interfaces

Add support for adding / deleting or changing network
interface descriptions. To simplify the implementation
all reconfiguration happens in the dispatcher thread
and not as part of reloading the config file.

To avoid ending up in a situation where we no longer
can connect to memcached changing the interfaces
works by first enabling all new interface descriptions,
and if no error happens it'll shut down the ones
no longer in the configuration.

Line:73, daemon/connections.h -> I think a reference to the shared_ptr so you don't increment the ref count just for the call?

Line:79, daemon/memcached.h -> in front_end_thread you have a typedef, should it be used everywhere?

Line:44, daemon/server_socket.h -> ideally take a reference so you don't increment the ref count until you really need to

Line:73, daemon/connections.h -> Or even better, just pass a reference / ptr to the ListeningPort given `conn_new` doesn't take a reference to the shared_ptr.

See http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-smartptrparam

Line:44, daemon/server_socket.h -> Note that Core C++ guidelines recommends just passing by-value - http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-sharedptrparam-owner

As long as the by-value shared_ptr is moved-from if assigned elsewhere (i.e. set to the member variable) then the ref-counts shouldn't be modified unnecessarily.

Line:810, daemon/settings.h -> Syle: Prefer folly::Synchronized for this kind of thing, basically gives you the lock guard for free.

(If you don't want shared access you probably want to template Synchronized on std::mutex).

Line:50, daemon/thread.cc -> Move idiomatic to pass by-value, as it's explicit to the caller the ref-count will be increased.

(see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#r34-take-a-shared_ptrwidget-parameter-to-express-that-a-function-is-part-owner)

Line:73, daemon/connections.h -> Done

Line:79, daemon/memcached.h -> That would require that header to be included by "all" files instead of just where we need it (I created the alias so that I didn't have to wrap the lines so many times...

Line:44, daemon/server_socket.h -> Keeping it by value to make it clear that we keep a ref internally (In most deployment this will only be called 6 times during startup (3 interfaces and both ipv4&6). And possibly if the admin disable ipv4 / ipv6.

Line:810, daemon/settings.h -> Keeping it like this for now and should move to folly as a separate task (the same pattern is already used multiple places in the file).

Line:50, daemon/thread.cc -> Done
