DESCRIPTION:

MB-38173: Remove assertions in takeover test and deal with buffer ack

Whilst developing a patch for MB-38173 I ran into not so "intermittent"
test issues with "test dcp consumer takeover". The issues appear
unrelated but debugging is made much harder by throwing assertions
instead of printing the actual values of checks. Swap the assertions
to checks to progress this change.

One cause of the intermittent failure appeared to be that we could get
buffer acks in the test that were not handled.
