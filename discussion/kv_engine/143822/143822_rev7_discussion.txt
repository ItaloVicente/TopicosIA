DESCRIPTION:

MB-43708: Add proper wouldblock support to setCollections

The memcached function, collections_set_manifest_executor wasn't
structured to handle 'wouldblock' properly, and as such failure
of the background task meant the task resumed the ep-engine
function which leads to access of deleted data.

A second issue was spotted in that a failed setCollections didn't
clean-up some of the manager state, so subsequent setCollections
calls would return ebusy (as if the previous call was still
in-progress).
