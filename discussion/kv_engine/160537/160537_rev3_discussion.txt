DESCRIPTION:

MB-48234, MB-48233, MB-48249: Revert recent checkpoint manager changes

The change "MB-48038: Don't trigger any CheckpointVisitor if
mem-recovery not needed" (ccb728623267829d2255c5ce0c2f21922c20353f)
causes us to less aggresively recover memory from closed checkpoints.
This is causing various memory related issues as we don't reclaim
memory properly. This change had many others changes built on top of
it and rather than manually unpick the logic it's safer to just revert
the related changes. This patch reverts all 5 changes described by the
squashed commit history below:
