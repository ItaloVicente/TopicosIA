DESCRIPTION:

MB-31327: Ephemeral backfill does not respect purge seqno.

Fix a bug in the memory_backfill of ephemeral buckets by checking
that the purgeSeqno < startSeqno of a backfill when startSeqno != 1.

Change-Id: Ia91d6d1e82fcfb7ea2d6463c76a531ea0d8aa182

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Worth also expanding the description to describe the consequence of the bug.

Line:53, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> Just to confirm - is acquiring this lock sufficient to ensure there's no race with the TombstonePurger task(s)?

Line:70, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> Is startSeqno of 0 not also permitted?

Line:214, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> Not seeing the state lock acquired here - what's guaranteeing an in-flight Tombstone purge doesn't occur just after this check and advance the purgeSeqno?

Line:304, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Nit: You can also simplify to ASSERT_TRUE(vb.get()) if you wish.

Line:374, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Probably worth asserting the purgeSeqno has indeed advanced correctly.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:53, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> I think this is vulnerable to race conditions. TombstonePurger never appears to get the vb state lock, only the seqlist write lock. This task gets the seqlist write lock inside a seqlist range read lock when we call inMemoryBackfill on the vb, but without getting the vb state lock. Per our chat will remove the changes to this task as we don't use it

Line:70, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> No, a STREAM startSeqno of 0 => a BACKFILL startSeqno of 1. Should probably be renamed in the future for clarity

Line:214, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> Good point. Think this needs to be moved to after we have the rangeIterator which blocks/is blocked by the StaleItemPurger. I think we race against the TombstonePurger which grabs the seqlist write lock instead, but the TombstonePurger only marks items as stale which should be okay

Line:304, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Done

Line:374, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Done
