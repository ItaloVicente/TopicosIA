Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)
Line:115, daemon/connection.cc -> Might be clearer to express this not in the negative - i.e.:

 ret["metered"] = ....

Line:314, daemon/connection.cc -> We have this code in multiple places (at least 3 in this file). Could you create a helper method which sets unmetered & unthrottled based a give privilegeContext ?

Line:1060, daemon/connection.h -> Might be clearer if this is expressed in the positive - i.e. rename to "throttled" and it's value defaults to true. 

Same for unmetered.

Line:115, daemon/connection.cc -> I chose the same value as the privilege to make it clear if it was set or not. I could flip it, but then it wouldn't map directly to the privilege...

Line:314, daemon/connection.cc -> I've done that in a separate patch ( https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/176642 ) where I made the droppedPrivileges persist across an RBAC db update.

Line:1060, daemon/connection.h -> That makes the if-statement a bit misleading:

   isThrottled() 
   
that would imply that the connection is currently being throttled instead of what we've got now with:

   isUnthrottled()
   
(and our use of the methods would then always have to be negated if we want to flip them around:

    if (throttle_limit == 0 && !connection.isThrottled()) {
       return false;
    }
    
So I think I would prefer to keep as is.. (I could alternatively rename them to isSubjectForThrottling() but I don't feel like it gives me much apart from a lot of typing ;) )

Line:1060, daemon/connection.h -> I agree the _Privilege_ should be named "Unthrottled" as that's the "extra" thing we grant users (default is to be throttled), but in terms of the logic which applied the check I think using the non-negative form makes for more readable code.

Note there's a mix of usages in the code - sometimes you say:

 if (!isUnthrottled())
 
and other places you say:

 if (isUnthrottled())
 
Personally I think avoiding the double negative makes the code more readable, so in the above examples I think it's easier to read as:

 if (isThrottled())
 
and

 if (!isThrottled())
