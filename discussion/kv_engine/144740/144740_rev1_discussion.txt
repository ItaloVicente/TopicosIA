DESCRIPTION:

MB-41658: Don't clear dirty flag unconditionally during warmup

There exists a race-condition between warmup, commit of prepared
SyncWritess and persistence which can result in the persistence
callback finding a non-dirty item. This throws an assert failure and
terminates memcached.

The issue is caused when the following sequence of events occur, on
various concurrent threads:

  0. Outstanding prepare exists on disk (without Commit).

  1. [Reader] Warmup loads prepare from disk.

  2. [NonIO] ActiveDM completes prepare, adding Committed SyncWrite to
     HashTable (as dirty) and queuing Committed SyncWrite to CkptMgr.

  3. [Writer] Flusher runs, writing the Commit to disk - but crucially
      *doesn't* get as far as executing PersistenceCallback.

  4. [Reader] Warmup advances to value load phase, and loads the
     Commit from [3] into HashTable (setting it clean).

  5. [Writer] Persistence Callback runs, encounters a clean item in HT
     for item just persisted - CRASH.

The underlying bug is at [4] - when loading items into the HashTable
during warmup; they should _not_ be unconditionally set as clean.

Bulk of the patch is the testcase setting up the above sequence of
events, fix itself is straightforard :)

So about the assertion that is triggering in PersistenceCallback, have we considered to turn it into a DEV_BUILD check?

I considered it, but I don't think we should. 

In this particular case the fix was in a place where someone was incorrectly clearing the dirty bit (and the check is essentially benign), but that's not necessarily always the case. Persistence is very important; if we somehow end up trying to run the persistence callback on something which isn't dirty that could mean that we've somehow double-persisted something, or maybe not persisted something else. That is something I think we should fail for.

Yeah, that is the original reason for adding the assertion. But you know, at some point you see it triggering and you reconsider it 😊
