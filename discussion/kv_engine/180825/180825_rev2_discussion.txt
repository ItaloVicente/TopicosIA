DESCRIPTION:

MB-53922: Remove ~StoredValueProxy

The ~StoredValueProxy path may dereference it's non owning StoredValue*
and this is a source of bugs.

1) For ephemeral if the StoredValueProxy::value is marked stale it can
be deleted by the stale-item remover, allowing for a
heap-use-after-free error.

2) A number of HashTable update paths decide to drop the HashTable lock
manually, exposing the StoredValueProxy::value to possible manipulation
before the statistics are finalised - a likely source of subtle
statistic inaccuarcies (and is a unlocked read violation).
