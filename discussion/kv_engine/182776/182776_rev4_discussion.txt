DESCRIPTION:

Disallow version 1 of audit event configuration

All modules use version 2 (which added the filtering_permitted
attribute). Drop support for version 1 and update the documentation.

Allow 'sync' (which we don't support "yet") and "enabled" to be
optional and default to sync = false and enabled = true to remove
the amount of "boilerplate" info in the per-event specification.
