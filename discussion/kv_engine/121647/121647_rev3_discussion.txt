DESCRIPTION:

MB-37096: Debug CRT: Use fmtlib for hot stats formatting

ep_testsuite spends approximately 28% of it's runtime inside
Configuration::addStats (and it's child functions), and 16%
inside KVBucket::getAggregatedVBucketStatswhen run under
Windows Debug CRT.

Profiling shows that much of this cost is the creation of temporary
std::string objects and related std::stringstream formatting to strings.

Replace with fmtlib, using it's (stack-allocated) memory_buffer.

This reduces the runtime of the ep_testsuite suite from 134s
to 106s under Windows Debug config.
