DESCRIPTION:

MB-31325: Add Google Benchmark include directory

This change is in preparation of the upgrade of the Google Benchmark
library.
Multiple library commits between our current revision and the new
revision change the way GBench is built.
That requires that we specify the 'target_include_directories' in the
compilation units where we use the library.
