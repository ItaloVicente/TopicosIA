DESCRIPTION:

MB-31321: Collection connections can't select unsupported buckets

If a connection supports collections, then it should return an
ENotSupported error if the client attempts to select a bucket that
does not support collections. If a client attempts to auth on a
bucket that does not support collections using a connection that does,
then they will be moved to the no bucket, in the same way that they
are if they are not authorized.
