DESCRIPTION:

MB-29675: Change Task::getDescription() back to std::string

Task::getDescription() currently returns a non-owning string
(const_char_buffer), instead of an owning std::string. This was chocen
to minimise string copying as getDescription was called multiple times
per task execution (for example for taskLog / slowTaskLog - see
d26ea7d1f12aa021e74663a304d81d1f9e512097 which originally changed to
const_char_buffer.

However now taskLog / slowTaskLog have been removed, we will no longer
call getDescription anywhere near as frequently - short-running tasks
will likely never have their description requested. As such
pre-calculating the description (and having to ensure it's lifetime is
as long as any caller requesting it) is now less efficient than simply
generating it on-demand.

Change getDescription back to std::string, only creating a string
object on demand when it is requested.
