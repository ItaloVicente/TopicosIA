Line:133, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/ep_unit_tests_main.cc -> This is also not safe - putchar requires that the storage you pass it has lifetime of the program; if you use std::string then that is violated - the heap allocation of std::string could be freed (at teardown) before the environment is finished with - see https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/putenv.3.html

I can think of two options here:

1. change `allow_no_stats_env` to a std::array 
2. Use folly::setenv via <folly/portability/Stdlib.h> 

The only reason we don't use setenv originally is it doesn't exist on Windows.
