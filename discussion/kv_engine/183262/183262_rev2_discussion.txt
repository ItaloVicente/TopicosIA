DESCRIPTION:

MB-54571: Fix intermittently failing access scanner test

Because of the small max_size we are running this test with,
occassionally, all values would end up being evicted, in which case no
access.log is generated (as it would be empty).

Fix the test by always storing an item in shard 0 after the flusher
runs.
