DESCRIPTION:

MB-54850: Skip magma key-lookup optimization if Disk snap is Historical

As an optimization for improving the performance at flush, we tell
magma whether a replica is receiving the initial disk snapshot, ie the
vbucket is empty. In that case magma can skip the key lookups required
for maintaining the item-count, as any mutation received is an Insert
by logic.

That isn't the case anymore for when the initial disk snapshot is
Historical, as the snapshot might contain duplicates.
