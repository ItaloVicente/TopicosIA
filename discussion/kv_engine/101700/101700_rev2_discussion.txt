Line:413, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Most of this is the same as DcpDeletion. Suggest you create a helper function for the code which is the same, and then just keep the differences inline in each case.

Line:2193, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> This essentially looks like a for() loop (but with a manual increment clause) - I suggest you re-write it that way to be clearer.

Line:2199, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Hmm - but you're always checking for success anyways; so seems /exactly/ like a for() loop...?

Line:3715, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> ? You aren't actually wiping memory here ...

Line:3757, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Really? Surely you control the content of the document (at line 3704), so you either do or don't have XATTRs (I assume not)

Line:3760, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> You should probably put this before the stream-request - and in fact it should only take effect on streams created after it has been changed. In other words; you should't be able to change DCP_EXPIRATION on / off for existing streams (adds too much complexity for us to track).

Line:911, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Given this appears to be a precondition prefer ASSERT()
