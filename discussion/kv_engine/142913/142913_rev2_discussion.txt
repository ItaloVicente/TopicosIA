DESCRIPTION:

MB-41407: [BP] Do not use old StoredValue after soft delete

Backport of http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/139274 .

Fixes tsan-identified race between EphemeralVBucket::pageOut and
EphemeralVBucket::StaleItemDeleter immediately deleting the newly stale
item.

softDeleteStoredValue may lead to the existing item being marked stale.
At this point, is is no longer safe to use the old stored value, as the
StaleItemDeleter may delete it at any time.
