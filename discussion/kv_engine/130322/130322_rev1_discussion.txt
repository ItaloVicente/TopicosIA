DESCRIPTION:

MB-36335: Give compaction and flusher their own queue

With KVStore being created per-shard, the same instance of
a KVStore can be concurrently flushing and compacting. Both
CouchKVStore compaction and flush (commit path) are doing
local document updates and sharing the single queue that
CouchKVStore has, leading to memory errors.

This change makes compaction use its own queue for the
two local document updates it makes and writeVBucketState
use the non-queue method to write it's one update.
