DESCRIPTION:

MB-50647: Bypass ConnMap notification

ConnMap pendingNotifications queue is a bit redundant - background
threads can safely call

 engine.scheduleDcpStep(...)

often via

 DcpProducer::immediatelyNotify()

There is no need to queue connections requiring notification.

In addition, AtomicQueue is limited to being used by 500 threads
ever, including threads which have since been destroyed.

Once the queue is no longer needed, AtomicQueue can be removed

Line:237, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> Unrelated to your patch, but I think this comment is inaccurate - the notification is not synchronous - we use runInEventBaseThread() and not runInEventBaseThreadAndWait() at the bottom of this: https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/cfd978c12ca58a6b952ee8693fec748e85b05012/daemon/thread.cc#L168
