DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Fix intermittent failure of "test MB-26907 backfill expired value"

Test was iternittently failing due to waiting for a stat to increase to
5, that had already increase by 5 but not previously reset, hence it got
stuck at 10. This patch adds a stat reset between the two calls of the
function in an attempt to resolve this.
