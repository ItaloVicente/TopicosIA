DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Remove 'openCkptCreated' out-arg from ckpt-removal function

Used in production code only in legacy code that was responsible for
notifying TAP connections for sending checkpoint start/end items
(http://review.couchbase.org/c/ep-engine/+/4970/).

Rarely used in test code. In the few cases where we need it, we can just
check if the open-checkpoint-id has changed in the test-code rather than
in the production code.

Note that this patch is also in preparation for splitting the existing
CM::removeClosedUnrefCheckpoints function for enhanced testing.
