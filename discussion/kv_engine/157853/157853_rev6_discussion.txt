DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Remove 'openCkptCreated' out-arg from ckpt-removal function

Used in production code only in legacy code that was responsible for
notifying frontend connections blocked on CheckpointPersistence calls.
CheckpointPersistence was removed in MB-37858.

Rarely used in test code. In the few cases where we need it, we can just
check if the open-checkpoint-id has changed in the test-code rather than
in the production code.

Note that this patch is also in preparation for splitting the existing
CM::removeClosedUnrefCheckpoints function for enhanced testing.

Line:448, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Style: Personally I'd not rename `vbucket` to `vb` here - it increases the scope of the patch (more for human to read and ignore once noticed it's just a variable rename), and "vbucket" isn't exactly a long and unwieldy name anyway.

Line:39, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_visitor.cc -> Are we sure this notify is no longer necessary?

Line:39, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_visitor.cc -> Oh, and I forgot to update the commit message - this wasn't for CheckpointPersistence, this was for TAP

Line:448, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> So you're right on the approach, but reverting this name would be the only reason for going through another CV run. Plus:

- I need to touch this line anyway for removing the other arg
- there are just a couple of further line affected 
- all this code in [456, 472] is removed in a follow-up patch as all duplicated code (http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/157940/6/engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc)

So I would just submit as it is if you're happy with that
