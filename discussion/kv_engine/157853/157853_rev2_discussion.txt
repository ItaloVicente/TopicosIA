DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Remove 'openCkptCreated' out-arg from ckpt-removal function

Used in production code only in legacy code that was responsible for
notifying frontend connections blocked on CheckpointPersistence calls.
CheckpointPersistence was removed in MB-37858.

Rarely used in test code. In the few cases where we need it, we can just
check if the open-checkpoint-id has changed in the test-code rather than
in the production code.

Note that this patch is also in preparation for splitting the existing
CM::removeClosedUnrefCheckpoints function for enhanced testing.
