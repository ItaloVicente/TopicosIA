DESCRIPTION:

Skip more tests broken under RocksDB

These tests are technically broken because prepareToDelete is not
implemented for RocksDB. RocksDB doesn't care about this value
(delVBucket does not use it), however we dereference that pointer
from EP_DEBUG_LOGs elsewhere, which causes SEGFAULTS at that log level.
