DESCRIPTION:

MB-40531: Change order of vbuckets paging visitor visits

Testing after http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/133197
uncovered unexpected increases in cache miss ratio for a working set
which fits within the quota comfortably. This occurred after some time,
despite the workload reading the same keys in a loop.

Investigation discovered a large disparity in per-vbucket residency
(see MB for info).

Vbuckets with a lower vbid could be <20% resident while other vbuckets
remained fully resident. The fully resident vbs logically contain
resident cold data which has never been evicted despite never being
accessed.

This patch changes the order the paging visitor visits vbuckets. They
are now visited:

 * replicas before other vbucket states
 * from highest pageable memory to lowest (within a given vb state)

Testing demonstrates a lower standard deviation of the distribution of
per-vbucket residency ratios.
