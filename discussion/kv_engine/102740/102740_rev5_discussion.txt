DESCRIPTION:

MB-32336: Send seqno_acknowledged messages in response to prepare

Add support for the DcpConsumer to send seqno_acknowledged messages
back to the producer when a prepared seqno has been processed.

Add support for the DcpProducer to receive seqno_acknowledged
messages.

Note(1): The seqno_acknowledged message is currently sent directly by
the DcpConsumer once the prepared item has been processed; ultimately
this should be only when the complete checkpoint has been processed.

Note(2): The seqno_acknowledged message is received by DcpProducer;
but it isn't yet passed onto the DurabilityMonitor.
