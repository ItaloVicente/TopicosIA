File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Please expand the description - what and why are we doing this.
Line:259, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I think we should try to work "memQuota" / "bucket_quota" or similar into this name, to try to make the difference between it and "cursor_dropping_upper_mark" more explicit to the reader.

Line:102, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> This is getting pretty long / hard to read. Suggest re-phrasing it by explicitly listing the two triggers:

 Cursor dropping will commence if one of the following conditions is met:

 1.  ... 
 2.  ...

Line:117, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Nit: these can all be const.

Line:126, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Needs updating, it isn't necessarily always 50%.

Line:161, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Whitespace only - please revert.

Line:426, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> I don't think you need this anymore; IIRC the Configuration class validates in the set methods. Can you check and if so remove this line?

Line:90, engines/ep/src/vbucketmap.h -> Please add a description of this method.

Line:6291, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please revert the whitespace-only changes.

Line:6334, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> ditto
