DESCRIPTION:

Add Executor benchmarks

Add benchmarks for the existing ep-engine ExecutorPool, and Folly's CPUThreaPoolPoolExecutor.

Initially consists of three implementations of a one-shot Task benchmark:

Benchmark a one-shot task (runs once then completed). Measure how long
it takes to:
- schedule the Task to run on a background thread (to run asap),
- then run that Task and notify back to the main thread.

This is the pattern of KVBucket::visitAsync() - it creates a
VBCBAdapter Task wrapping the given VBucket visitor object, then runs
that task immediately.

This is a multithreaded benchmark - N sets of benchmark and NonIO
threads are created. The benchmark threads repeatedly schedule a Task
to be run to perform some work asynchronously, then waits on the
result. The background NonIO threads pickup the Task and run it, then
notifies the requesting thread via a condition variable.

By creating multiple benchmark threads we can measure the performance
of the ExecutorPool's scheduling implementation.  By creating multiple
background NonIO threads we can measure the performance of the actual
dispatch of Tasks on a ThreadPool.

The three implemenations of this are:

1. Existing ep-engine ExecutorPool.

2. Folly, using CPUThreadPoolExecutor::add(). This is the "low-level"
   API in folly - the consumer passes a Callable object to add(), and
   then are responsible for how the Task produces it's result back to
   thce consumer, and how the consumer waits. This is a similar API to
   what ep-engine ExecutorPool provides.

3. Folly, using folly::Future. This is "high0level" Future/Promise
   API, where the consumer creates a Promise, which is fullfilled by
   running in the CPUThreadPool and it can wait on the result.

    "items/s": count of Task schedule -> run -> return result iterations.

Observations:

* ep-engine ExecutorBench/OneShotScheduleRun is stuck around ~100k
  runs per second, increasing thread count doesn't improve
  things. This is somewhat expected given that the underlying NonIO
  TaskQueue has a single mutex guarding the queue.

* FollyExecutorBench/OneShotScheduleRun is ~10x faster then ep-engine
  for a single thread, and up to ~30x faster on the multi-thread
  tests. It also _does_ scale as thread counts increase, up to 4
  threads - which note is actually 4x frontend threads and 4x
  background threads. Note this machine only has a total of 12 logical
  cores so one would expect that more than threadds:4 (actually 8
  threads total) _would_ start to slow down here.

* FollyExecutorBench/OneShotFuture is ~5x faster than ep-engine,
  however it doesn't seem to scale with the number of threads. I
  haven't spent any time looking at this, but I suspect it's some
  issue with how I'm using the Future. However I think it's worth
  keeping this code around for "future" investigation.
