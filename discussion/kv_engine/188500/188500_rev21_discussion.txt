DESCRIPTION:

MB-56180: Reimplement throttle algorithm

The specification for throttling changed in the way that we
shouldn't limit a tenant to a certain limit iff there is available
capacity on the node.

This patch introduce 3 different tunables:

    node capacity    - This is the max units per second available
                       on the node and all of the buckets eat off
                       this limit

    reserved         - This is a reserved minimum on a per bucket
                       base that the bucket should have. No other
                       tenant may consume resources allocated for
                       this bucket

    hard_limit       - This is a maximum number of units the bucket
                       may have. This value is optional, and if not
                       set one may use up to all available resources.

Every second we subract all "reserved" units from each tenant
from the node capacity, and this is the "free pool" where all
tenants may allocate from once they exceed their soft limit.
When the free pool is empty everything gets throttled (unless
the connection holds the Unthrottled privilege)

There is currently an unused "read throttling factor" (rtf) and
"write throttling factor" (wtf) which is set to 1.0 for each
command. The thought was that one may want to reduce rtf for
memory resident items to reflect that they're cheaper to operate
on, and for instance increase wtf for durable ops (currently
they're hardcoded to 2x for a different reason (metering cost))

Line:32, utilities/throttle_utilities.cc -> When a limit is not specified, it will default to "unlimited", but which I think means:
```
mcthrottlectl --reserved 1000
```
will also set hard_limit to unlimited. Can we make these two properties non-optional?

Line:43, utilities/throttle_utilities.cc -> Why are we allowing number passed as string here?

Line:26, utilities/throttle_utilities.h -> Nit: naming

Line:32, utilities/throttle_utilities.cc -> This is an API just being used by the regulator (mcthrottlectl will go away as no one will get the privileges to run it).

sending "{}" would throttle commands to the bucket when all the entire node capacity is used. It would be the same as sending {"reserved":"unlimited","hard_limit":"unlimited"}. If one just wants to set a minimum guaranteed capacity one could just send {"reserved": 500}.

We could of course force the regulator to always send a full payload, but being so strict has the disadvantage that one would need to synchronize all commits if we ever want to add / remove new tokens etc. Given that it is a private interface between two internal components I think we may be a bit relaxed.

The previous spec was based on a hard_limit for each bucket, and that's what they wanted to "remove" in the new spec. I didn't want to completely remove the ability to set a max limit on one tenant as I do find that useful (for instance I miss that functionality on my router. It may prioritize one device, but the others are still able to consume so much that it still affect the device I wanted to be prioritized).

Line:43, utilities/throttle_utilities.cc -> No particular reason..

Line:26, utilities/throttle_utilities.h -> Done

Line:34, docs/Throttling.md -> can this doc be update to clarify the distinction of what a tenant is - i first read it thinking about users (that we auth as) but it's really the bucket isn't it? I.e. 10 connections all authed as different users, but all working on the same bucket will be throttled based on the bucket - not the user?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:32, utilities/throttle_utilities.cc -> From the documentation of the command: 

The per bucket properties may be set with the (privileged) command
`SetBucketThrottleProperties` (0x2a) which takes the name of the
bucket in the key field, and a JSON document with the following syntax:

    {
      "reserved" : 100,
      "hard_limit" : "unlimited"
    }

"reserved" is the guaranteed resource usage (the amount is reserved)

"Hard_limit" if present (and not set to "unlimited") the tenant will be
throttled at this limit. If no hard limit is specified the tenant will only be 
throttled unless there are no free resources on the server.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:32, utilities/throttle_utilities.cc -> Alright, so given a bucket with:

> reserved: 100,
> hard_limit: 1000,

Using the set command with payload:

> { "reserved": "200" }

will result in:

> reserved: 200
> hard_limit: unlimited

This is somewhat unintuitive to me, but if that is what is required :shrug:
