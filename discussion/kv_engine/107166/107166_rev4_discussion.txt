Patch Set 4: Code-Review-2

No point in doing this unless it is causing an issue... Didn't appear to have any cache contention on this. We'd have to swap one lock for many locks but we would still have to lock something and the DcpConsumer should be served by only one thread so not likely to make a difference.
