DESCRIPTION:

Suggestions to fix on Dave's patchset

1. PauseCommand and UnpauseCommand should take session_token
   to the constructor to ease use (and be renamed with a
   Binprot prefix to be consistent with the rest of the
   commands)

2. Pause and Unpause should be executed on the thread
   pool and not block the frontend thread

3. Pause and Unpause should honor the session_cas set by
   ns_server

4. Don't hold the bucket lock when running pause/unpause
   as that blocks other connections to disconnect from
   the bucket (or stats to read the bucket details)

5. Wait for all clients to disconnect before pausing
   the bucket.
