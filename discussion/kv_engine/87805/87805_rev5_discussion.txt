Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> What's the P for?

Line:41, tests/testapp/testapp_client_test.cc -> now that it's moved this is wrong... but I suggest we leave it where it is and rather nuke the copies ;)

Line:32, tests/testapp/testapp_client_test.h -> Why move this method? We currently have duplicates elsewhere which should use this instead (for the shutdown tests etc)

Line:81, tests/testapp/testapp_client_test.h -> This should probably be moved to the TestappClientTest class instead? it isn't bound to xattrs (given that we want to use it from the cluster config tests which isn't about any xattrs at all)

Line:32, tests/testapp/testapp_client_test.h -> Because setClusterSessionToken is needed by this test suite; and given I've migrated the tests from being based on TestappClientTest to TestappXattrClientTest; that class now needs the method.

I can't see any direct duplicates of this method - do you know what the other one(s) are called?

Line:81, tests/testapp/testapp_client_test.h -> So TestappXattrClientTest is really mis-named now (I plan to rename it after all this) - it's really the base class test fixture for tests which are parameterized on all the main variables (Protocol, XATTR, JSON) - not necessarily tests which rely on those features.

As such; this is the most base class where you are going to be testing different datatypes.

(The whole hierarchy is a bit weird currently; there the older tests which use static methods to send / receive data; and the newer ones which use McbpConnection. Ideally we'd migrate to the newer type).

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> 'P' stands for 'tyPo' ;)
