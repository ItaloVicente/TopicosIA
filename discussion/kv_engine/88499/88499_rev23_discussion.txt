DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: Add ItemFreqDecayer Task for Eviction Algorithm

The new eviction algorithm requires us to record a counter for each item
in the hash table.  When an item is referenced its counter is
incremented (using a statistical accumulator).

To avoid the counters becoming saturated an "decayer" task is required
that reduces the counters on a periodic basis.
