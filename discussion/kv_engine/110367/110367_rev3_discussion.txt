DESCRIPTION:

MB-34412: Accept duplicate prepares at replica

For a given window when a consumer resumes from a previous point it
may receive two prepares in a row if the producer de-deuplicates the
commit message. In this case, we should overwrite the existing prepare.
The given window for which this is valid is for any prepare that the
consumer has already received between the HighCompletedSeqno and the
HighPreparedSeqno.
