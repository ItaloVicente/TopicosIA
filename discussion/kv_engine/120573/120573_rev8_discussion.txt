DESCRIPTION:

MB-36285: Restructure RangeReads as a RAII guard

Previously range reads held a lock for their entire duration to prevent
any other concurrent range reads. As backfills may be long-lived and
run on multiple threads across their lifetime, this lead to a TSAN
failure from unlocking the lock from a different thread than locked it
originally.

This patch removes this lock and ensures only a single range read
will occur at a time in a different manner, without passing locks
between threads.

Additionally, the new ReadRangeManager paves the way toward having
multiple concurrent range reads with minimal change to the code using
range reads.

Line:43, engines/ep/src/range_read.h -> best to not define unless required - https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-zero

Line:49, engines/ep/src/range_read.h -> if you define == I like to define != as well (simply by calling your own == and negate the return). Makes it easier to EXPECT_EQ/NE

Line:72, engines/ep/src/range_read.h -> const

Line:115, engines/ep/src/range_read.h -> cpp core - rule of 5, default or delete the copy cons and assignment
