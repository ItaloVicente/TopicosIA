DESCRIPTION:

MB-36285: Restructure RangeReads as a RAII guard

Previously range reads held a lock for their entire duration to prevent
any other concurrent range reads. As backfills may be long-lived and
run on multiple threads across their lifetime, this lead to a TSAN
failure from unlocking the lock from a different thread than locked it
originally.

This patch removes this lock and ensures only a single range read
will occur at a time in a different manner, without passing locks
between threads.

Additionally, the new ReadRangeManager paves the way toward having
multiple concurrent range reads with minimal change to the code using
range reads.

Line:59, engines/ep/src/range_read.cc -> Can the Expects be made strict (> instead of >=) ?

Line:59, engines/ep/src/range_read.cc -> Logically yes - testing it locally fails lots of tests because the old (at least, used only from tests) rangeRead code calls it for each item in a for-range loop, meaning the first time round it calls it with a seqno == the existing one. Will fix that and change the expects, everywhere else it should be true.
