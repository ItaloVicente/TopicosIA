DESCRIPTION:

MB-36285: Restructure RangeReads as a RAII guard

Previously range reads held a lock for their entire duration to prevent
any other concurrent range reads. As backfills may be long-lived and
run on multiple threads across their lifetime, this lead to a TSAN
failure from unlocking the lock from a different thread than locked it
originally.

This patch removes this lock and ensures only a single range read
will occur at a time in a different manner, without passing locks
between threads.

Additionally, the new ReadRangeManager paves the way toward having
multiple concurrent range reads with minimal change to the code using
range reads.

(12 comments)
Line:105, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> Probably worth keeping this comment.

Line:103, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> Nit: you don't need this.

Line:505, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> Suggest prefixing this with "try" or similar if it can fail (akin to lock() / try_lock() on a standard library mutex etc).

Line:169, engines/ep/src/linked_list.h -> Given our conversation this morning, consider if this should rename the "Read" part given it may also be used for exclusive (Write) access.

Line:335, engines/ep/src/linked_list.h -> ditto

Line:59, engines/ep/src/range_read.cc -> Should this be allowed to decrease the start (i.e. expand the range?)

Line:34, engines/ep/src/range_read.h -> Style: It's unnecessary to use const on pass-by-value arguments, especially when primitive types.

Line:173, engines/ep/src/range_read.h -> Personally I'd probably just use a ReadRangeManager*, given it's semantically the same (and half the size) ;)

Line:182, engines/ep/src/range_read.h -> This feels a little imprecise / incorrect.

It's not so much we cannot move items due to received duplicates, it's that we have already "promised" a Backfill consumer that it can read all seqnos in a given range and hence we cannot delete (de-duplicate) such seqnos *if* they were to be modified.

Line:190, engines/ep/src/range_read.h -> Style: Prefer in-class initialisers where possible.

Line:219, engines/ep/src/range_read.h -> Please document this function.

Line:226, engines/ep/src/range_read.h -> Please document these.
