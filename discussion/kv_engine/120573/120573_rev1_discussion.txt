DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Refactor RangeReads to RAII guard

Lots of TODOs to decide how to handle where the old code moved the
range start. Once multiple ranges are permitted it would be
straightforward to acquire a new range with a later start and replace
the old one, but that would not perform well. It could be done less
frequently, e.g., only every 100 seqnos.

Previously range reads would hold a lock for their entire duration to
prevent any other concurrent range reads. As backfills may be
long-lived and run on multiple threads across their lifetime, this lead
to a TSAN failure from unlocking the lock from a different thread than
locked it originally.

As this patch removes this lock and ensures only a single range read
will occur at a time in a different manner, this failure can be
avoided.

Additionally, the new ReadRangeManager paves the way toward having
multiple range reads without needing to change the structure of the
code using the range read.
