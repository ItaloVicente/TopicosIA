DESCRIPTION:

MB-29184 CouchRocks: Enable Manual Compaction

Manual Compaction was a missing feature under RocksDB.
We enable it now as part of MB-29184 as it is useful to test the
implementation of the "Compaction Filter to purge the Seqno CFs".
So, with this change we implement the KVStore::compactDB() interface
for RocksDBKVStore.
