DESCRIPTION:

MB-47604: Move CompactionCtx::purgedItem to PurgedItemCtx

This allows NexusKVStore to track a maxPurgedSeqno without having to add
it to the CompactionContext (as no production KVStore needs it). We
will accomplish this in a future patch by using a subclass that
overrides purgedItemCtx to update a Nexus specific value in purgedItem.
