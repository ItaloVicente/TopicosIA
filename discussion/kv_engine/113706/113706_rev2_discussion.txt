DESCRIPTION:

MB-35654: Make expelling only operate on the oldest checkpoint

Currently, expelling will operate on the oldest checkpoint _containing
cursors_, which may not be the _oldest checkpoint_.

Expelling from a checkpoint which is _not_ the oldest is unsafe as it
leaves holes in the items a cursor will read. This patch prevents this.

If the oldest checkpoint is unref'd (i.e., all cursors are in other
later checkpoints) it can be deleted as a whole; expelling from such a
checkpoint would be inefficient. Given this, trying to expel should be
a noop - no checkpoints are valid candidates.
