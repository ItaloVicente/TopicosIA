DESCRIPTION:

MB-35654: Make expelling only operate on the oldest checkpoint

Currently, expelling will operate on the oldest checkpoint _containing
cursors_, which may not be the _oldest checkpoint_.

Expelling from a checkpoint which is _not_ the oldest is unsafe as it
leaves holes in the items a cursor will read. This patch prevents this.

If the oldest checkpoint is unref'd (i.e., all cursors are in other
later checkpoints) it can be deleted as a whole; expelling from such a
checkpoint would be inefficient. Given this, trying to expel in this
state should be a noop - the oldest checkpoint will be dropped if it
remains unreferenced, and no other checkpoints are valid candidates.

Line:551, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> You can still tighten this up - you can explicitly state how many items should be found after expelling. 

Additionally I don't believe you need 6 items - wouldn't one item per checkpoint be sufficient?

Line:551, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> Roger, will tighten that up. However, looks like 3 in the first snapshot is the min thanks to logic in expelUnreferencedCheckpointItems

 /*
         * Walk backwards over the checkpoint if not yet reached the dummy item,
         * and pointing to an item that either:
         * 1. has a seqno equal to the checkpoint's high seqno, or
         * 2. has a previous entry with the same seqno, or
         * 3. is pointing to a metadata item.
         */
        while ((iterator != oldestCheckpoint->begin()) &&
               (((*iterator)->getBySeqno() ==
                 int64_t(oldestCheckpoint->getHighSeqno())) ||
                ((*std::prev(iterator))->getBySeqno() ==
                 (*iterator)->getBySeqno()) ||
                ((*iterator)->isCheckPointMetaItem()))) {
            --iterator;
        }

It won't expel anything if there are fewer than 3 non meta items (Or I am missing something, equally possible!)

PS. there's a checkpoint start and a vbstate prior to the items, triggering the prev(..) case then the isCheckpointMetaItem case

Line:551, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> Ok, fine - but probably worthy of a comment mentioning _why_ 3 items are added to each one.
