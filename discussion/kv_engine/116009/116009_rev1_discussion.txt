DESCRIPTION:

Ensure all stats in FileStats & KVStoreStats reset correctly

Modify FileStats and KVStore stats to ensure that all elements
(counters and histograms) are reset correctly when the reset() method
is called.

Remove the manually-specified default ctors - all the members of the
class initialise themselves in their own ctor already.

Also de-inline the reset() methods given they are not small and are
not performance-sensitive.
