DESCRIPTION:

MB-37374: XattrNoDocTest: Make explicit when tests are not supported

Previously we reported Success for all these tests, without any
indication they were actually skipped. Instead explicitly flag them as
skipped.

Note: Once this is merged to master (where we have GoogleTest v1.10)
the test status changes to SKIPPED instead of PASS.
