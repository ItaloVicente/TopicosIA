DESCRIPTION:

MB-47462: Introduce unreffed checkpoint callback

Adds a callback triggered when:

 * a cursor moves out of, or is removed from, the oldest closed
   checkpoint
 * an unreffed open checkpoint is closed and becomes the oldest
   closed checkpoint

This can be used to trigger checkpoint removal on-demand.

This patch only introduces and tests the callback; for ease of review
on-demand checkpoint removal will be introduced in a separate patch.
