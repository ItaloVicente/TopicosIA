DESCRIPTION:

MB-51117: Set the OSO range to only include the requested collection

Prior to this patch the range for say collection:8 was set as:

start="8"
end="9"

The kvstore by-id scan uses an inclusive range, so would of returned
a key that exactly matches the end.

The correct range is:

start="8"
end="8\xFF"

which matches only keys from collection:8

I've set the MB as morpheus, this is a minor issue so can be committed once branched from neo

Could you also add a test for the result of the OSO range calc?
Line:46, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_id_disk.cc -> second "prefix" -> "suffix"?

Line:73, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_id_disk.cc -> this is also wrong, size here should be just the bytes consumed by the leb128+255

A test for systemeventfactory? or else where? this does have coverage in the collections unit tests, but is mostly benign

I didn't see any test changes so was assuming we don't have anything currently explicitly flagging this bug. Would be nice to have addition to say the collections unit tests which highlights this bugfix.

It's tricky without additional test framework to expose the lower layers.

The issue is that the bug is quite minor as there are multiple protections which stopped it being a problem.

1) The range only spans into the adjacent collection by 1 "illegal" key. E.g. if my scan was for collection:8 we would need to have stored a key that is "9" only i.e. no logical key, a set of "" into collection 9. The scan also only loads that one key, it won't traverse completely into collection 9

2) If we do load an adjacent collection key, ActiveStream will throw it away as part of filtering

so these make it hard to trigger and detect

Ack. Seems pragmatic to just fix then - I'm guessing you came across this as part of the work for Range Scans, so we'll also have tests covering it there down the line?
