DESCRIPTION:

MB-51117: Set the OSO range to only include the requested collection

Prior to this patch the range for say collection:8 was set as:

start="8"
end="9"

The kvstore by-id scan uses an inclusive range, so would of returned
a key that exactly matches the end.

The correct range is:

start="8"
end="8\xFF"

which matches only keys from collection:8

E.g. if my scan was for collection:8 we would need to have stored a key that is "9" only i.e. no logical key, a set of "" into collection 9. The scan also only loads that one key, it won't traverse completely into collection 9

Yeah, debugging some other change which caused an OSO test to fail, it made me look at the ranges used in OSO based on the tests I added here https://review.couchbase.org/c/couchstore/+/169159
