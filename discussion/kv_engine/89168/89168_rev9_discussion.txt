DESCRIPTION:

MB-27844: Audit Daemon - Add event_states list

Add an optional event_states list to version 2 of the configuration to allow
events to be dynamically enabled or disabled.

The format of the list is a list of tuples {event_id, state} e.g.

"event_states" : [ {"id" : 1234, "state" : "enabled"},
                   {"id" : 5678, "state" : "disabled"} ]

If the event_states is not defined the configuration will still be accepted.

Given the introduction of the event_states list, the patch also depreciates the
"disabled" list in version 2 (as it does not allow events to be disabled).

If the "disabled" list is defined in version 2 it will be ignored.
