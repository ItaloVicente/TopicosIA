Line:135, daemon/buckets.cc -> Style: you can simplify this as you're only performing a single expression on the locked object - something like:

 (*throttledConnectionMap.wlock())[&thr].swap(connections);

Line:141, daemon/buckets.cc -> We are going to end up locking throttledConnectionMap multiple times (once for each connection which returns true for reEvaluateThrottledCookies). Suggest you instead build up a temporary container of all connections to add back to the map inside the for() loop, then after the for loop perform a single map::merge() call (while locked) to update the map.

Line:159, daemon/buckets.cc -> I assume these are response messages received by memcached - e.g. DCP messages?

Line:169, daemon/buckets.cc -> As above, you don't need the lambda etc - just do

 (*throttledConnectionMap.wlock())[thread].push_back(connection);

Line:228, daemon/buckets.h -> Do we need ordering? If not then std::unorderd_map is cheaper.

Line:138, daemon/mcbp_privileges.cc -> Suggest tagging with TODO or an MB number to highlight we need to revisit this.

Line:71, tests/testapp_serverless/serverless_test.cc -> Suggest adding a comment why this is reduced from 1024 to 256 here.

Line:135, daemon/buckets.cc -> from readability perspective I find the "one-liner" a lot harder to read (and for how long the lock is actually being held...)

Anyway. This will all go away once I remove the lock.

Line:141, daemon/buckets.cc -> The locking to the std::map will go away in a future patch so I don't think its worth spending time to add extra complexity (for an unexpected problem. This code gets called when you've received a new set of credits of CUs, and reEvaluateThrottledCookies would only return true if we can't resume all of the commands due to the entire set of credits have been used).

Line:159, daemon/buckets.cc -> Yes (and for authentication requests we send to ns_server etc)

Line:169, daemon/buckets.cc -> as with the earlier, the lock is planned to go away.

Line:228, daemon/buckets.h -> We don't need ordering at all. As the @todo mention I can flip this over to an std::vector<std::deque<Connection*>> and not use any locking at all (just need to resize it correctly at creation time. the lock is because std::[unordered_]map could change its internal data layout as part of insert. I'll flip to unordered_map for now and remove the locking in a separate patch.

Line:138, daemon/mcbp_privileges.cc -> I removed the "workaround" (I just added it so that I could test it locally in a full cluster without ns_server support)

Line:71, tests/testapp_serverless/serverless_test.cc -> Done
