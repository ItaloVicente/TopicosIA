DESCRIPTION:

MB-27724: Install libmemcached_logger in <root>/lib

The RPATH on macosx is incorrectly specified and includes
the "install path" as a fallback. It should be replaced
with @executable_path instead.

Patch Set 4: Verified+1

Self verifying as it's getting late here and I'm heading off for bed. This is a rebase of the patch which passed on the commit validation builders (except for the perf one which had a long queue)...

Verifying and merging to resolve the blocker state before heading to bed.
