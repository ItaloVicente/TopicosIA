DESCRIPTION:

Make checkpoint seqnos weakly monotonic

Seqnos in Checkpoints are currently not weakly monotonic as some
meta items are enqueued with lastBySeqno + 1 whilst others are not.
If we were to see a set_vbucket_state followed by a checkpoint_end
then we would see our seqno go back by 1.

Enqueue all meta items with lastBySeqno + 1 to make checkpoint seqnos
weakly monotonic.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

(1 comment)
Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> I believe this is a re-commit. Can you:

a) Add a comment / tweak the title to note that.
b) Add a comment describing how this differs from the previous attempt to aid the reviewer (so I don't have to play "spot the difference" too much between the two patches...
