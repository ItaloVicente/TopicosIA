DESCRIPTION:

MB-47462: Shard checkpoint destruction task

Checkpoint destruction has previously been a "single threaded"
activity; a single task per bucket was responsible for it.

As load increases, with fast persistence/ephemeral buckets, destruction
of checkpoints may become a bottleneck, limiting the rate at which
memory will be recovered from CheckpointManagers.

To resolve this, add support for multiple CheckpointDestroyer tasks,
distributing checkpoints across them based on vbucket id.

This allows checkpoint removal to be coarsely scaled through the config
param `checkpoint_destruction_tasks`.

For now, the default is 1, matching the existing behaviour.

This may be increased in the future, but should be driven by
performance testing.
