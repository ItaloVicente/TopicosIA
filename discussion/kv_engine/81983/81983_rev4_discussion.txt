DESCRIPTION:

MB-25342: Reorder Collections::VB::Manifest update/serialise

Previous to this commit an update to the Collections::VB::Manifest
would:

1: Serialise the manifest state to a system-event
2: Update the manifest

This ordering is creating issues for new code that is performing full
deletion of the collection data. The issue being that some new changes
being made by step 2 don't get captured in step 1.

It is much simpler to (and really should of been like this from the
start):

1: Update the manifest
2: Serialise the manifest state to a system-event

This patch refactors the add/beginDelete methods so that they return
the ManifestEntry which is affected by the update allowing us to
"patch" it with the seqno we get from queueing of the serialised
manifest.

::completeDeletion is also updated but not refactored.

VbucketManifestTest is also altered slightly so that completeDeletion
is given more test coverage, it now applies updates to the replica
and compares active with replica.

(4 comments)
Line:173, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> This probably occurred as a result of some intermediate refactoring, but it looks like the direct check from how it was before (`collection == DefaultCollectionIdentifier`) would still be valid here (I don't see `defaultEntry` being used for anything else).

Line:174, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> nit: This is more of a philosophical thing - it's not immediately apparent to a reader that `modifiedEntry` isn't NULL in this situation (especially given it gets initialised to that above) which could potentially result in a null dereference if this function were poorly modified in the future.

I would personally either explicitly check this isn't null directly preceding this line (ie. ensuring the post-condition) or restructure the function such that the declaration of `modifiedEntry` is in the scope of the if-block and can be turned into a reference (and then directly returned from that scope).

Line:184, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> I guess it's already implied by including the function name, but it might be nice to include the reason (collection already exists) in the exception message.

Line:238, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Can be restructured to make it easier to read (Testing positive conditions first, no else after return/exception, uses direct return instead of pointer):

    ManifestEntry& Manifest::beginDeleteCollectionEntry(
            cb::const_char_buffer collection, uint32_t revision) {
        auto itr = map.find(collection);
        if (itr == map.end()) {
            throw std::logic_error("beginDelCollection: did not find collection:" +
                                   cb::to_string(collection) + ", revision:" +
                                   std::to_string(revision));
        }

        if (collection == DefaultCollectionIdentifier) {
            defaultCollectionExists = false;
        }

        return *itr->second;
    }
