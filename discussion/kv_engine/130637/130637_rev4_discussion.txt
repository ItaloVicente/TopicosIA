DESCRIPTION:

MB-34150: Add test to show how we update the Persisted Snap Range

This patch highlights some behaviour of how snap-markers, checkpoints
and the flusher track what we define the "last consistent seqno" on a
replica node.

On a replica, that quantity is defined as the "end-seqno of the last
complete persisted snapshot".

One of the outcome of the investigation is that at some point
(MB-35003) we started with tracking that quantity on disk in
vbucket_state::lastSnapStart. We do use that value properly, but:
 - the name is misleading, now that tracks what we define above
 - by overriding the semantic of that member we have lost part of the
   state that was originally stored on disk, i.e. the real "last snap
   start"

Because of the latter, by looking at the vbstate on disk we are not able
to know what is the range of the current snapshot being persisted. E.g.:
 - in-memory snapshot is [x, 20]
 - in-memory high-seqno is 15
 - the flusher runs and persists everything (i.e., up to high-seqno 15
 - the new vbstate on disk is
    {highSeqno:15, lastSnapStart:9, lastSnapEnd:20}

By looking at that vbstate we don't know what is the real "last snap
start" of the partial snapshot being persisted, as 9 represents the
"end-seqno of the last complete persisted snap". The current snap-start
may fall anywhere in [10, 15].

I aim to "fix" that in a follow-up.
