DESCRIPTION:

MB-26603 [RocksDB] Allow to collect internal Statistics

RocksDB allow to collect cumulative performance Statistics over time.
With this change we allow to switch Statistics on and off depending on
the kv-engine configuration. We introduce a new 'rocksdb_stats_level'
parameter in 'configuration.json'. An empty value disables Statistics.
The periodic interval for RocksDB to collect Statistics can be set with
the 'stats_dump_period_sec' parameter in 'rockdb_options'.
