DESCRIPTION:

MB-30015: Check validity of exptime before checking with purge_before_ts

The compactor checks if the exptime field of the tombstone is less
than purge_before_ts before deciding to purge the item. But the
exptime field needs to have a valid delete time value in order to
do be considered. In case if a tombstones ends up being zero, it
might never get purged which is still a better scenario compared
to a tombstone getting purged much earlier than it should.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I believe the issue of a zero exptime only exists in unreleased Vulcan builds in the range 5.5.0-1949 and 5.5.0-2866 (builds containing http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/88301/ and not containing the fix http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/95204/). 

Therefore we don't have a released, official build which exhibits this problem - we should always have a valid expiry in tombstones in released builds. As such, I don't think we need to do anything here for two reaons:

1. we don't support upgrade between undressed versions.
2. Even if this was a supported upgrade path, I actually think it's better to purge a tombstone earlier than never at all. If we never purge tombstones we would eventually run out of disk space and not be able to recover.

I agree that running out of disk is definitely a concern. But, that would only happen if there is a bug in the KV-engine layer that caused tombstones to have an expiry of 0. We don't have any issues today but in the likelihood that we have more such issues, it might be better to have the data (to triage the problem especially in customer environments) as opposed to a data loss.

You make a fair point. 

So I think in this instance we don't want to do either silently (purge or ignore).

I think what we should do instead is treat an empty exptime as an error case and print a warning message in the log. 

In that case it's probably ok to keep the tombstone; as long as there's some method for us to purge them eventually - for example add a new option to compaction (and connect up to epctl so we can change the behaviour at runtime).
