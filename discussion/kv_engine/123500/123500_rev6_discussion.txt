DESCRIPTION:

MB-37416: Expose per-collection stats by name or ID

Previously, collection stats were available at manifest-level (exposing
what collections and scopes exist) or per-vbucket (e.g., memory usage of a
collection for each vbucket). This patch aggregates the per-vbucket
stats, and makes them available by collection name or ID (hex, with
optional 0x prefix).

$ cbstats localhost:12000 collections testscope.testcollection3
 testscope:testcollection3:id:       0xa
 testscope:testcollection3:items:    0
 testscope:testcollection3:mem_used: 0

$ cbstats localhost:12000 collections id 0xa
 testscope:testcollection3:id:       0xa
 testscope:testcollection3:items:    0
 testscope:testcollection3:mem_used: 0

$ cbstats localhost:12000 collections id 0Xa
 testscope:testcollection3:id:       0xa
 testscope:testcollection3:items:    0
 testscope:testcollection3:mem_used: 0

$ cbstats localhost:12000 collections id a
 testscope:testcollection3:id:       0xa
 testscope:testcollection3:items:    0
 testscope:testcollection3:mem_used: 0
