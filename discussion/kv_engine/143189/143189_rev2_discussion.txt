DESCRIPTION:

Rename KVStore::getVBucketState to getCachedVBucketState

The function returns the vBucket state from the cache but that's not
particularly clear from the name.

getVBucketState() is part of the KVStore public API, and "cached" vbstates are an internal concept that KVStore implementations may or may not have internally. So it seems to me that the function name shouldn't refer to caching

The vbstate cache is a part of all 3 KVStore implementations and does exist in the KVStore API (albeit with protected access level - cachedVBStates and various cached counters). There are other non-public functions in the KVStore API that deal with the cache.

As you say, any "cache-aware" usage in protected/private.
But in the child patch I see that the plan is to change the KVStore public interface from just getVBucketState to getCached/getPersisted. Maybe mentioning that in the commit message here is useful to understand why this patch.
