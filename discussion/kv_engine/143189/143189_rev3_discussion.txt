DESCRIPTION:

Rename KVStore::getVBucketState to getCachedVBucketState

The function returns the vBucket state from the cache but that's not
particularly clear from the name. In a future patch I'd also like to add
a KVStore::getPersistedVBucketState function to return the on disk
state. This should make the KVStore API more intuitive and will allow us
to read the persisted vbucket_state of vBuckets without casting the
KVStore to the child type.

> But in the child patch I see that the plan is to change the KVStore public interface from just getVBucketState to getCached/getPersisted. Maybe mentioning that in the commit message here is useful to understand why this patch.

Done
