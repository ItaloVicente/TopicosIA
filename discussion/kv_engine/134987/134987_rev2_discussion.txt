DESCRIPTION:

MB-39292: Add Manifest::isSuccessor

KV shall only accept new Manifests if they are a valid successor
to the current state.

1) The uid is incrementing (this was always previously checked)
2) Immutable properties stay immutable. E.g. if we have a scope or
   collection and the new manifest includes a scope/collection of
   the same ID, the name cannot of changed.

The new function Manifest::isSuccessor returns true if another
Manifest is a valid successor to itself.

This patch also includes further Manifest sanity checks in
construction.

1) The manifest with uid:0 has one expected configuration.
2) The default collection has the expected name.
3) The default scope has the expected name.
