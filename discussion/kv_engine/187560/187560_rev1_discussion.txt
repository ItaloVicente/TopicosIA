  MB-54729: DCP disk backfill a CDC stream

Conflicts:
  engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc
  engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h
  engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_id_disk.cc
  engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc
  engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc
  engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.h
  engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc

Note that this is a non-trivial merge as the master dcp/backfill is
not compatible with the neo change.

Overall the idea of the original patch is still relevant, that is that
a new scanning phase is possible if the KVStore flags that history is
retained and when the stream has history enabled.

In this version of the code what used to be part of backfill_disk is now
moved to a new level of the backfill hierarchy in a new file called
backfill_disk_to_stream. The code there provides some functions for use
in the ByID/ByKey backfill classes so that the history scan can be
invoked.

The new phase of backfill is managed mostly by the "generic" state change
code which is in backfill.cc and sits above all backfill implementations.
However the code there now has new hooks to ask the sub-classes if the
state can move to ScanHistory.

There are also a few other changes required to satisfy CV as the master
branch has more Monotonic sequence numbers, and the "double" snapshot
nature of a history backfill can violate the Monotonic requirements as
it reassigns the same end seqno for example.
