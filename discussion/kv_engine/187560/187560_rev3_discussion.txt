DESCRIPTION:

Merge commit '108151d6f' into 'couchbase/master'

* commit '108151d6f':
  MB-54729: DCP disk backfill a CDC stream

Conflicts:
  engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc
  engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h
  engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_id_disk.cc
  engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc
  engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc
  engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.h
  engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc

Note that this is a non-trivial merge as the master dcp/backfill is
not compatible with the neo change.

Overall the idea of the original patch is still relevant, that is that
a new scanning phase is possible if the KVStore flags that history is
retained and when the stream has history enabled.

In this version of the code what used to be part of backfill_disk is now
moved to a new level of the backfill hierarchy in a new file called
backfill_disk_to_stream. The code there provides some functions for use
in the ByID/ByKey backfill classes so that the history scan can be
invoked.

The new phase of backfill is managed mostly by the "generic" state change
code which is in backfill.cc and sits above all backfill implementations.
However the code there now has new hooks to ask the sub-classes if the
state can move to ScanHistory.

There are also a few other changes required to satisfy CV as the master
branch has more Monotonic sequence numbers, and the "double" snapshot
nature of a history backfill can violate the Monotonic requirements as
it reassigns the same end seqno for example.

Line:294, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> What about the option of just making endSeqno WeaklyMonotonic?
That would avoid the need of this new logic.
I'm mostly concerned on line 293 that essentially might completely bypass the Monotonic checks.

Line:294, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Also, probably good to use a switch on source, that more directly evident how all the cases are handled, eg:

switch (source) {
case SnapshotSource::NoHistory:
case SnapshotSource::NoHistoryPrologue:
    return true;
case SnapshotSource::History:
    return newEndSeqno != currentEndSeqno;
}

.. or, we keep this new code and we ensure that we never go backward, eg:

    if (currentEndSeqno > newEndSeqno) {
        throw ..
    }

In the end it is only the newEndSeqno==currentEndSeqno case that we want to make legal

Line:294, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Making the type WeaklyMonotonic is not appropriate as there are other places (memory snapshots) that assign to the endSeqno, we want all of those other assignments to respect the strict Monotonic requirement. Whereas only for disk (with History) needs the special case. This reasoning is mentioned in the comment.

The extra suggestion of  if (currentEndSeqno > newEndSeqno) is basically what happens - this code always assigns when the currentEndSeqno != newEndSeqno, if they violate the monotonic requirement we get a throw in the assignment. Adding a new throw is not required.

I can certainly though switch on all SnapshotSource values

Line:418, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> No, this occurs in an OSO -> History transition where wasFirst is false (because the OSO snapshot was sent) yet lastSentSnapStartSeqno is 0 because OSO doesn't send a seqno range

Right, I misread the code indeed on that part 👍
