DESCRIPTION:

MB-32904 [SR]: Introduce the DurabilityTimeoutTask

This patch introduces the DurabilityTimeoutTask, which is responsible
for enforcing the Durability Timeout for the SyncWrites tracked in
KVBucket.

With this patch the Timeout is enforced internally in KVEngine, i.e.:
- the task runs periodically and checks for timed-out SyncWrites
- the timed-out SyncWrites are removed from tracking, so they will
  never be committed

But, given that VBucket::abort is not implemented yet, then:
- timed-out SyncWrites will stale in HashTable/disk as pending
- clients will hang as we do not send any DCP_ABORT yet

Change-Id: I71db84426f829f8acd4d83a82b73f0d381fb1ed6

File Comment: engines/ep/src/durability_timeout.h -> Suggest renaming to "durability_timeout_task.h"
Line:20, engines/ep/src/durability_timeout.h -> Don't believe you need this.

Line:33, engines/ep/src/durability_timeout.h -> const meaningless here.

Line:39, engines/ep/src/durability_timeout.h -> De-inline this please.

Line:62, engines/ep/src/durability_timeout.h -> Please add a brief comment describing this class.

Line:83, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_engine_test.h -> This looks similar to SingleThreadedExecutorPool (in fake_executorpool.h) - can that one be used instead of creating a new one?

File Comment: engines/ep/src/durability_timeout.h -> I've omitted the "task" as this file contains also the DurabilityTimeoutVisitor.
But happy if we prefer to rename anyway

File Comment: engines/ep/src/durability_timeout.h -> It's just that "duraility_timeout" sounds like it contains some kind of timeout type; not an actual background task - so it wasn't clear to me what this file contains.

But, probably better to generalize the existing SingleThreadedExecutorPool to a MockExecutorPool that may be single or multi-threaded.

Line:83, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_engine_test.h -> .. while doing, I've realized that there's a good amount of code to touch.
Deferring the unification of MockExecutorPool and SingleThreadedExecutorPool in a dedicated change (MB-33045).
Here I'm just moving MockExecutorPool in its own source file.

Note that trying with using SingleThreadedExecutorPool gives some issues in a multi-threaded env. E.g., EventuallyPersistentEngineTest spin-locks until warmup has completed, which never happens as SingleThreadedExecutorPool runs 0 threads.
