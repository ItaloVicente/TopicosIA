DESCRIPTION:

MB-32904 [SR]: Introduce the DurabilityTimeoutTask

This patch introduces the DurabilityTimeoutTask, which is responsible
for enforcing the Durability Timeout for the SyncWrites tracked in
KVBucket.

With this patch the Timeout is enforced internally in KVEngine, i.e.:
- the task runs periodically and checks for timed-out SyncWrites
- the timed-out SyncWrites are removed from tracking, so they will
  never be committed

But, given that VBucket::abort is not implemented yet, then:
- timed-out SyncWrites will stale in HashTable/disk as pending
- clients will hang as we do not send any DCP_ABORT yet

Change-Id: I71db84426f829f8acd4d83a82b73f0d381fb1ed6
