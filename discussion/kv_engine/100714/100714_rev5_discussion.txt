Line:17, docs/UnorderedExecution.md -> As per HipChat conversations, I suggest we make the OoO opt-in on a per-command basis (using flex extras to specify this request can be OOO).

Then we can have a limited set of opt-in commands.

Line:17, docs/UnorderedExecution.md -> The server still needs to protect against this. When I briefly spoke to Dave F and Matt I yesterday none of them was a huge fan of having to specify this on a per command base, so I feel we need to discuss the topic more before settling on if we want it on a per command base or not.

Line:17, docs/UnorderedExecution.md -> Sure, the HELLO is necessary for the client to be /allowed/ to set the OOO flag - otherwise it's an invalid request.

It just feels too complex to me to reason about the protocol (from client & server's POV) if we say "this flag turns on OoO for a server-specified set of opcodes (which might change over time)." 

I'm *positive* we'll need the ability for the client to selectively turn off OoO for specific requests (durability requests are probably a good example); so we'll need an encoding in at least one direction. 

Adding a byte to every OoO request doesn't seem unreasonable to me given it'll make the protocol a lot more explicit and easier to debug (consider how this will look in wireshark).

Line:17, docs/UnorderedExecution.md -> I haven't fully made up my mind yet what I prefer as it depends on a number of factors. Like if this mode is only used in situations where 99% of the traffic is operations where reordering is ok, we might as well be better off by having the client specify unordered = FALSE. As of wireshark I don't think it'll be _that_ hard to detect if the channel is OOO or not, as we'd spot that in the order of the opaques.... 

Anyway the server needs to have a whitelist of which opcodes it _may_ reorder, so even if the client tries to send a lets say select bucket with reorder = true we won't allow that.

For sure - but that's partly why I'm proposing this method - the client will get an explicit EOOO or similar error if they attempt that; as opposed to "globally" enabling OOO and then expecting SELECT_BUCKET is not ordered and then not having any direct feedback when it isn't (apart from no other requests being handled until SELECT_BUCKET completes).
