DESCRIPTION:

MB-48531: Shard the Checkpoint Remover Task

The new 'checkpoint_removers' param in configuration defines the number
of concurrent tasks.

Each task is assigned a Task::removerId in [0, num_removers - 1]. Each
task is then responsible for touching only vbuckets that verify
(vbid % numRemovers == removerId).

Change-Id: I3b36d1ea264c37f9a8933bfd0523d796a18a4807
