DESCRIPTION:

MB-48531: Shard the Checkpoint Remover Task

The new 'num_checkpoint_removers' param in configuration defines the
number of concurrent tasks.

Each task is assigned a Task::removerId in [0, num_removers - 1]. Each
task is then responsible for touching only vbuckets that verify
(vbid % numRemovers == removerId).

Change-Id: I3b36d1ea264c37f9a8933bfd0523d796a18a4807

(3 comments)
Line:806, engines/ep/configuration.json -> would it be worth a more generic name, to reflect that this scales expelling/cursor dropping too?

Line:254, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> This does take a config lock each call, but it's probably not important given there's a bound to how many times this will be called, and it's not a long operation under the lock

Line:262, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> is make_pair necessary with emplace?

Line:806, engines/ep/configuration.json -> It is definitely the case to change the name of the task itself actually.. Didn't want to delay this code for with that but we seem fine now, so I m renaming the task now and rebasing on top of it

eheh :doh:

true.. the config param is NOT dynamic, so it can be easily cached. Doing

Line:254, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Yeah better to avoid in general but I don't think we need to worry here, this task runtime is largely dominated by deallocations anyway

(Note you're also going to serialise this task with anything else which reads config...)

Line:262, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Not really, I think this is a leftover from a previous push_back
