DESCRIPTION:

MB-48531: Shard the CheckpointMemRecoveryTask

The new 'num_checkpoint_mem_recovery_tasks' param in configuration
defines the number of concurrent tasks.

Each task is assigned a Task::id in [0, num_tasks - 1]. Each task is
then responsible for touching only vbuckets that verify
(vbid % num_tasks == id).

Change-Id: I3b36d1ea264c37f9a8933bfd0523d796a18a4807

Line:806, engines/ep/configuration.json -> As per previous comments, please start this name with "checkpoint" (and move up there) so in cbstats etc output it's grouped with related config params.

Line:65, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.h -> We shouldn't be mixing test code and production where possible; can you achieve the same with a subclass which exposes protected stuff - or ideally don't rely on non-public state for testing?

Line:65, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.h -> Well, I think the older tests use that pattern; but if possible it's much nicer to have a subclass inherit and expose protected data there. 

Is there any reason why getVBucketsSortedByChkMem() needs to be protected? it doesn't change any state, so allowing anyone to call it doesn't violate any internal class invariants...

No reason apart that it's used only internally in prod code, I m happy to make it public though, you're right it doesn't alter the internal state. Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:65, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.h -> This is only for using 'friend CheckpointRemoverTest;' and testing the protected getVbucketsSortedByChkMem(), which is the important to new thing to test.
It is CheckpointRemoverTest (suite) itself that exposes the protected bits, and by doing so we allow any testcase (subclass of CheckpointRemoverTest) to access the protected bits too.
We ca surely introduce a mock-like for the Task and do that way, I'm just going the short path here. Note that this is a very wide test pattern in our code (ie making a test class friend of the prod code, and then testing all the inner bits if necessary)
