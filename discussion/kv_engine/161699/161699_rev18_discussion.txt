DESCRIPTION:

MB-48531: Shard the CheckpointMemRecoveryTask

The new 'num_checkpoint_mem_recovery_tasks' param in configuration
defines the number of concurrent tasks.

Each task is assigned a Task::id in [0, num_tasks - 1]. Each task is
then responsible for touching only vbuckets that verify
(vbid % num_tasks == id).

Change-Id: I3b36d1ea264c37f9a8933bfd0523d796a18a4807
