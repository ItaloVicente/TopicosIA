DESCRIPTION:

MB-55672: Increase RangeScan read buffer by 20%

Change from 8192 to 9754 which restores parity (or close to) prior
to the IO changes related to MB-55672.

This is not by any means intended to represent the most
optimal/performant configuration.

Single node, 16 vbucket 420MB of data returned by the scan.

Time to perform key scan (no limits), average of 5 runs.
