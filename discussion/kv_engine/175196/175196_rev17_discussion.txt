DESCRIPTION:

MB-53879: Add support for reporting typed (Gauge, Counter) metrics

The Prometheus exposition format[1] includes a "type" e.g.,

 # HELP http_request_duration_seconds A histogram of the request
 # duration.
 # TYPE http_request_duration_seconds histogram
 http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.05"} 24054

This is largely informational, and is not strictly required.

However, for consistency with the metering spec it would be ideal for
KV to report certain metrics as counters or gauges - this patch adds
this.
