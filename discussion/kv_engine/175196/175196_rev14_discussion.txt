DESCRIPTION:

MB-51874: Add support for reporting typed (Gauge, Counter) metrics

The Prometheus exposition format[1] includes a "type" e.g.,

 # HELP http_request_duration_seconds A histogram of the request
 # duration.
 # TYPE http_request_duration_seconds histogram
 http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{le="0.05"} 24054

This is largely informational, and is not strictly required.

However, for consistency with the metering spec it would be ideal for
KV to report certain metrics as counters or gauges - this patch adds
this.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> What's the addtional value this patch brings? You mention that specifying the type is not needed by prometheus, and this will bring an additional cost in serialising / deserialising Prometheus metrics between kv_engine and ns_server. Is it worth the cost?

Line:38, include/statistics/metric_type.h -> I believe this is only needed in (generated) .cc files - can we reduce it's scope so we are not pulling in the nlohmann::json headers (and generating code) every time this header is included?

Line:48, include/statistics/metric_type.h -> This and the operator<< below don't really need to be inline; they just make this header more expensive to include.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> As it stands, everything is already exposed as "Untyped" by prometheus-cpp as we aren't specifying anything better, so the actual cost of serialisation shouldn't be significantly higher.

Realistically I don't think this would be worthwhile if it came at a non-negligible cost - it's mostly for consistency. Even then, it's not necessarily an intentional goal to have these types, the regulator/other go will have the type specified "incidentally" from how the exposer registry is used:

 r.addCounter("throttle_secs_total", ...
 
Whereas KV doesn't have that, as we grafted prometheus on top of existing stats code (and it definitely wasn't worth the effort to add the ability to declare it for every metric at the time).

It _would_ also please the handful of people making dashboards - I've had a few enquiries about why everything is untyped. Counter/Gauge is of some mild utility in that case, as it can inform what kind of UI element is appropriate.

I'm happy to hold off on this until there's a particular push for it. It's definitely not of great value for metering given the small set of well defined values.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for the background info. If the additional cost over the network is close to zero then I don't have a problem with the patch and am happy to go in, I was just assuming we were not sending any type information over the wire...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:38, include/statistics/metric_type.h -> This header isn't widely included. This macro does need to be visible anywhere the deserialisation is used (otherwise it will default to integer). I can split it into a separate header, but currently it would be included in the same (single) .cc as this header

Edit - actually went down a different path.
