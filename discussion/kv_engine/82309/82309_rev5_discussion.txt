DESCRIPTION:

MB-25661: FsStats: Add read() & write() count histograms

Add histograms of the number of read() & write() calls per open() /
close() pair to the Couchstore StatOps class. Report this histogram as
part of `kvtimings`.

While useful in it's own right - "How much work are we doing for every
couchstore operation?" - this can also be built on by the higher level
CouchKVStore class to note how many read() calls occured during higher
level operations.

Example:

 ro_3:fsReadCount (6229 total)
    5 - 6   : (  0.03%)    2
    6 - 7   : (  0.27%)   15
    7 - 8   : (  1.94%)  104
    8 - 10  : ( 29.81%) 1736 #############
    10 - 12 : ( 90.98%) 3810 ##############################
    12 - 15 : ( 99.97%)  560 ####
    15 - 18 : ( 99.98%)    1
    18 - 22 : (100.00%)    1
    Avg     : (      9)
