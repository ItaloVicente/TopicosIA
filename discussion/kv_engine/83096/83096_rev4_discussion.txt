DESCRIPTION:

MB-25822: Recalibrate maxExpectedDuration for all Tasks

Each GlobalTask object defines a maximum expected duration for
executions of that task type; executions which exceed this threshold
are logged (currently into an in-memory circular buffer).

However, all subclasses currently just inherit the value from the base
class of 3.6ms. This is not very useful - some tasks (e.g. warmup, or
disk-related) often exceed that value; for other tasks that value is
far too generious. As a result the current "slow tasks" log is of
little value.

To address this, make GlobalTask::maxExpectedDuration() pure virtual;
and define a suitable value for *all* subclasses. This has been done
empirically by looking at runtimes from statistics from various
cbcollect_info logs.

This means that entries in the 'slow tasks' log are actually
meaningful. A following patch will also record these slow executions
in memcached log file (similar to Slow Ops), to make their occurance
more explicit.
