DESCRIPTION:

MB-51806: Select HPS of highest range persisted during flush

Currently we only update the highPreparedSeqno on disk if we are
persisting the item at the end of a snapshot. This is correct, but
fails to take into account that a Checkpoint only sets it's HPS
value when it sees a prepare. We could have a flush batch such that
we persist no item at a snapshot end for Checkpoints containing
prepares and the HPS is not moved when it should be. E.g.

[1:Pre(key1), 2:Mutation(key2)][3:Mutation(key2)]
             ^
         HPS = 1

When visited by the flusher the HPS of 1 is not persisted. This allows
for a scenario where a replica node restarts and the HPS goes backwards
as this node would still ack 1 back to the Producer. If the cluster
has two replicas and the other replica is behind, it's possible for it
to be picked for promotion over this node. See MB for full scenario.

Correct this by iterating the ranges that we flush and pre-populating
the HPS value that we persist with the highest HPS in all but the
final range. The HPS can only be set for the final range if it is
fully persisted and the current code deals with that case.
