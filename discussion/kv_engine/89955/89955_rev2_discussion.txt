DESCRIPTION:

MB-28346 [1/7] HashTable: Move statistics into own class

HashTable statistics management is a delicate business. As it is too
costly to iterate across the entire HashTable to determine the count
of deleted, temporary, etc items; we instead maintain a running count
of each statistic, incrementing/decrementing as items are
added/removed; or when their state changes.

To attempt to make this counting more robust; move the various
statistics into their own nested class - HashTable::Statistics; which
can essentially make the stats read-only from within HashTable.

Patch 1 - create Statistics class, and move the statistics into it as
public members. Subsequent patches will reduce the visibility of
these; adding appropriate accessors / mutators.

Line:73, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Again, probably it is possible to remove this as part of this change.

Line:76, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> It becomes

    valueStats(st),

if we remove the HashTable::stats member.

Line:235, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Probably more readable to specify for each member, and not sure if 'numNonResidentItems' includes temporary items or not, e.g.:


// Count of all (alive and deleted) resident and non-resident items. Excludes temporary items.
cb::NonNegativeCounter<size_t> numItems;
// Count of all (alive and deleted) non-resident items. [Excludes temporary items.?]
cb::NonNegativeCounter<size_t> numNonResidentItems;
// Count of deleted items
cb::NonNegativeCounter<size_t> numDeletedItems;

Line:369, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Duplicate of 'getNumInMemoryItems()' at line 345.

Line:794, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> We can probably remove this as part of this change, I see it has been moved into the new HashTable::Statistics class.

Line:73, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Not directly - if you look later in the patch series I've reduced the instances of this, but not removed it entirely - some stats (e.g numFailedEjects) arn't easy to update directly from HashTable::Statistics.

Either way, the patch series is making incremental changes here.

Line:235, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> That's coming later in the patch series (note this was just moved from a previous location in the file; it's not new code).

Line:369, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Agreed; but this is an existing API - I deliberately didn't want to change the external API of the class here.
