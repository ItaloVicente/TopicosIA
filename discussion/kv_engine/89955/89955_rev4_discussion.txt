DESCRIPTION:

MB-28346 [1/7] HashTable: Move statistics into own class

HashTable statistics management is a delicate business. As it is too
costly to iterate across the entire HashTable to determine the count
of deleted, temporary, etc items; we instead maintain a running count
of each statistic, incrementing/decrementing as items are
added/removed; or when their state changes.

To attempt to make this counting more robust; move the various
statistics into their own nested class - HashTable::Statistics; which
can essentially make the stats read-only from within HashTable.

Patch 1 - create Statistics class, and move the statistics into it as
public members. Subsequent patches will reduce the visibility of
these; adding appropriate accessors / mutators.
