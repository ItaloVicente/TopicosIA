DESCRIPTION:

MB-38266: Limit flusher batch size to 1 if limit lower than shards

If the configured flusher total batch limit is lower than the number
of shards then we would end up configuring all of our flushers with a
limit of 0 items. This could cause rebalance failures as we fail to
flush disk snapshots. Correct this by setting a minimum limit of 1.
