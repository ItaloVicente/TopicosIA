DESCRIPTION:

MB-51498: Yield between read/writes for an SSL_accept

Remove the "while(true)" loop that drives multiple calls
to SSL_accept and drive it via socket events. This means that
code added as part of MB-53428 is duplicated into the accept
path to handle the case where a write is required.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> What's the plan to test this?

Line:1058, daemon/connection.h -> Maybe mention it can "successfully" return -1 if it needs more data (and will set ewoldblock in that case)?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Currently we have coverage in memcached_testapp that uses SSL connections, so the accept loop has that regression check (and in fact patch2 had a bug picked up by some of the memcached_testapp code)

From a field pov it's never been super clear why we may have some "slow" accept times other than read/write latency

All testing from openssl client also only showed the SSL_accept was invoked twice for all TLS version - unclear how we could broaden coverage of the SSL negotiation, maybe more and more advanced certs?
Line:1058, daemon/connection.h -> Ack

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Nod. I think if you look at the original CBSE which precipitated this issue (linked off MB-42607) there's some info about large / complex certs where which triggered the original issue.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Ok, so running with much larger certificates (and smaller BIO) gave much improved coverage and the new code reflects this testing.

I've integrated a much larger cert into the repo so we get even further coverage of the accept loop, the new stats in the log message show things like

INFO 43: Using SSL cipher:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 accept-duration:218983us with 119 accepts, certificate duration:9us
