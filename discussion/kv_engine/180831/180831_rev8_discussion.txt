DESCRIPTION:

MB-51498: Yield between read/writes for an SSL_accept

Remove the "while(true)" loop that forces many recv/send syscalls and
replace with a loop that moves SSL to a successful accept using socket
events.

Test coverage of the various WANT_READ/WRITE clauses occurs in
testapp_tls as it uses a very small OpenSSL BIO. This coverage is
now extended by adding a much larger key/certificate that pushes the
accept function through many cycles.

The new key and certificate are generated using openssl:

openssl genrsa -out 16k_testapp.pem 16384
openssl req -new -x509  -days 3650 -sha256 -key 16k_testapp.pem \
 -out 16k_testapp.cert -subj '/C=NO/O=Couchbase Inc/OU=kv eng/CN=Root CA'
