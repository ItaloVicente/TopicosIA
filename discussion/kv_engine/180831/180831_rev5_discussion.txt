DESCRIPTION:

MB-51498: Yield between read/writes for an SSL_accept

Remove the "while(true)" loop that forces many recv/send syscalls and
replace with a loop that moves SSL to a successful accept using socket
events.

Test coverage of the various WANT_READ/WRITE clauses occurs in
testapp_tls as it uses a very small OpenSSL BIO. This coverage is
now extended by adding a much larger key/certificate that pushes the
accept function through many cycles.

The new key/certificate was generated using openssl:

openssl genrsa -out 16k_testapp.pem 16384
openssl req -new -x509  -days 3650 -sha256 -key 16k_testapp.pem \
 -out 16k_testapp.cert -subj '/C=NO/O=Couchbase Inc/OU=kv eng/CN=Root CA'

Line:829, daemon/connection.cc -> I wonder if can construct things so we just perform a single call to SLL_accept() in each call to Connection::sslAccept() - to avoid blocking the other connections assigned to this thread (as per the original issue). 

(I know we aren't performing a blocking read(), but SSL_accept I believe can do quite a bit of computation for crypto in each call).

Line:829, daemon/connection.cc -> I had tried that, but if the connection has read all data from the socket (it's all in input pipe) nothing triggers memcached to run the connection again  (tried a few variations)

I'll ping Trond see if he has anyidea

Line:829, daemon/connection.cc -> So far the current ideas don't work without having to change the memcached state-machine. 

if we do just return from ssLAccept (after indicating a yield) the connection does later get another run but the state-machine wants to do a network read (tryAndReadNetwork) and that gets upset when there is no data to read and disconnects

At the moment, the line 829 case was only really seen in test code when the BIO was smaller than the input-pipe (e.g. the 64b BIO from the unit tests).

Taking the 16k cert and running everything with default config, or even when I had a 512b BIO, the line 829 case doesn't trigger.

The other case where we will "spin" in this function is the "standard" want_write behaviour, SSL_accept has filled the output BIO - this certainly occurs when the certificate is large (e.g. the 16k cert) and SSL_accept is trying to send that large amount of data to the client (BIO keeps filling) - this is certainly the case we're likely to encounter

Line:829, daemon/connection.cc -> Nod.

I assume even with this modified while() loop we are only performing non-blocking calls inside it (copying data between BIOs, doing crypto inside openssl)?

If so, then I assume the time taken in here _should_ only be of the order of milliseconds - and if so that's probably ok for 6.6.6 IMO.

(Out of interest - if you look at the libevent TLS code we use in 7.0.0+, does that yield back to the event loop in this case, or does it also "spin" and process all the outstanding BIOs etc?)

Line:829, daemon/connection.cc -> (Aa an aside, I checked Folly's code for running the SSL_accept in a background thread - https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/main/folly/io/async/AsyncSSLSocket.cpp#L1287-L1296 - and they essentially run each each call to SLL_accept() in the provided runner; meaning if multiple calls to SSL_accept() were needed to complete the handshake they would not block other connections from being serviced).

Line:829, daemon/connection.cc -> re: libevent - it's hard to say for sure from their code - it certainly doesn't loop "directly" around SSL_accept https://github.com/libevent/libevent/blob/5df3037d10556bfcb675bc73e516978b75fc7bc7/bufferevent_openssl.c#L1019


I'll make some tweaks to this code though - it would be interesting to record actual time spent in SSL_accept along side actual time to full process the accept (with all read/write/wait time).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:829, daemon/connection.cc -> On the topic of time, probably worth adding one (or more) phosphor trace spans around TLS handshake - it's probably rare enough we can unconditionally add them.
