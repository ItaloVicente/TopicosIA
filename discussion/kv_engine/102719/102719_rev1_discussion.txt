DESCRIPTION:

Retry notification of worker threads during shutdown

When moving over to bufferevents calling signalIfIdle
the actual connection may be run at a later time and
not necessarily immediate. This could cause the shutdown
to hang as we've notified the thread, but that notification
what swallowed as part of another "notify_io_complete"
routine causing us to bump back to libevent to wait for
the next event.

Loop and signal the notification pipe until the thread
stops

Line:467, daemon/thread.cc -> Nice to remove the sleep unless we need it - otherwise might have a negative impact on things like test shutdown - note that on Linux you can't necessaily accurately sleep for just 250 microseconds...

Line:467, daemon/thread.cc -> The "problem" is that we don't know if we need to sleep or not. We could replace with std::this_thread::yield, but that could fill up the notification buffer and possibly cause other errors... 

(if there was a "join thread with timeout" call we could have use that and kicked it again if it didn't return within the a timeout)

Line:467, daemon/thread.cc -> You can do something like:

 notify_thread(thread);
 while (thread.running) {
     std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::microseconds(250));
     notify_thread(thread);
 }
