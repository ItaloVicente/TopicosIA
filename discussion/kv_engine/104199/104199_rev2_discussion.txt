DESCRIPTION:

MB-32835: Fix stored value equivalence operator deletionSource handling

Fix an issue where (ordered) stored value's equivalence operator would
fail if the deletionSource did not match, but the value was not deleted.
In this case, the deletionSource should not be checked as it is updated
on a values deletion/expiration.
Also added a test for this issue, which requires the use of
MockStoredValue to access the protected deletionSource without deleting
the stored value.
