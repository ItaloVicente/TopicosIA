DESCRIPTION:

MB-25701: Replace manually-managed dynamic array with std::vector in
Bucket::stats

Change was made in order to conform to Couchbase's and C++'s
best-practices. Using a vector instead of a dynamic array produces
less error-prone code. Examples of prevented errors include memory
leaks caused by not freeing array resources, or trying to access
out-of-bounds array elements by mistake.

Patch Set 3:

I think your Commit validation failures are due to your patch being outdated compared to other changes  in the build - you need to rebase your patch on top of current master.

Something like:

 git fetch couchbase
 git rebase couchbase/master
