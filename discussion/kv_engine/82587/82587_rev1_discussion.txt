DESCRIPTION:

MB-25701: Replace manually-managed dynamic array with std::vector in Bucket::stats

Change was made in order to conform to Couchbase's and C++'s best-practices. Using a vector instead of a dynamic array produces less error-prone code. Examples of prevented errors include memory leaks caused by not freeing array resources, or trying to access out-of-bounds array elements by mistake.

Code change itself looks pretty good - nice work on your first change! Few stylistic and minor suggestions below.
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Style: please wrap commit messages at 72 columns - see https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

(Most editors should handle this for you) - emacs is M-q for example.

Line:34, daemon/buckets.h -> Nit: Headers should be in alphabetical order - see https://github.com/couchbase/memcached/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#include-style

Note: We have a pre-commit hook which will automatically run `clang-format` on any lines (and will fix this for you) - see https://hub.internal.couchbase.com/confluence/display/cbeng/Using+the+git+clang-format+pre-commit+hook

Line:105, daemon/buckets.h -> Delete commented-out code.

Line:162, daemon/buckets.h -> Style: In C++ it's redundant to include `struct `  here, you can simply omit it.

Line:162, daemon/memcached.h -> As previous, you don't need `struct` here.

Line:125, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> Whitespace-only change - please revert.

(This just creates a "false" change in the history of this file, making it harder to see exactly what patches affected it).

Line:118, daemon/stats.h -> As above, remove `struct`

Line:118, daemon/stats.h -> Instead of passing `num`, you can simply ask the vector for it's size, using the size() method.

Line:496, daemon/thread.cc -> Similar here, better to just use thread_stats.size(), then you are guaranteed to reset all elements in the vector.
