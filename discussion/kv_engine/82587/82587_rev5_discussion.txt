DESCRIPTION:

MB-25701: Replace manually-managed dynamic array with std::vector in
Bucket::stats

Change was made in order to conform to Couchbase's and C++'s
best-practices. Using a vector instead of a dynamic array produces
less error-prone code. Examples of prevented errors include memory
leaks caused by not freeing array resources, or trying to access
out-of-bounds array elements by mistake.

Looking good - just a couple of minor things.

Can you also add the `kv_engine_dev` group to the set of reviewers - we generally have everyone on the team review all code.
Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Note: the first line in a git commit message (the subject) is special - it's what is used in short git logs. 

However, the subject is actually everything before the first empty line - in other words adding a manual carriage return here won't have any effect in most places ;)

I'd simply try to shrink your subject to 72 chars. Maybe replace "manually-managed dynamic array" with "new[]" ?

Line:118, daemon/stats.h -> Style: Given that we don't need to modify `thread_stats` to aggregate it, it's good practice to make it `const`. This has two main advantages:

1. It tells the reader that the object isn't modified (without them having to read all the code in the body of the method).
2. It allows this method to be called if you only have a const instance of a thread_stats vector.
