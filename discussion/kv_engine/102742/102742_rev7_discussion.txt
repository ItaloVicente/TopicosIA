DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Enable multiple replicas in the DurabilityMonitor

This patch:
- updates the internal DurabilityMonitor structures to support any kind
  of replication chain (note that still only 1 chain supported)
- enables pending SyncWrites tracking with multiple-replicas
- enables ready-to-commit tracking with multiple-replicas

Line:123, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Nit: You can push the acquiring of the mutex below the two sanity checks to reduce its scope.

Line:125, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> prefer invalid_argument given this is due to the function being passed an incorrect arg.

Line:130, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Same

Line:147, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Same here - you don't need to lock until after calling getDurabilityReqs

Line:68, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Isn't it always the one at the ealiest iterator - it at least that's a possible optimisation...

Line:214, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Recommend you put the mutex + all the things it guards in a struct - that way it's more explicit what is owned (for example are the iterators also guarded by it - you didn't mention them here...)

Line:68, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Not sure I understand.

In terms of replica-iterator, currently the next eligible for commit is always the one at majority-iterator + 1 (M2 + 1 in the example above). Also, by definition majority-iterator===commit-iterator (i.e., last committed is the last for which Requirements have been satisfied).

Removing elements as soon as they are committed means essentially (I use the example above):
1) removing {1, 2, 3, 4}
2) next eligible for commit is 5, so Container::begin()

Line:68, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> The next possible SyncWrite which could be committed is wherever the last iterator is; assuming that SyncWrite /just/ needs one more ack to be committed.

I was assuming you're not immediately removing committed items from the Container; but if you are then yes, the next one which could be committed is Container::begin().
