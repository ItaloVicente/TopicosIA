  2 Durable ops which costs 2x

Line:3397, tests/testapp_serverless/metering_test.cc -> Potentially yes; BUT we've got a clock granularity of 1 which means that it  could be expired "immediately" after the document got stored. To be absolutely sure that we don't see any side effects of DCP deciding to do dedupe an already expired object) I'd rather just let it take an additional second so that I can verify:

1. the document got successsfully stored
2. The document got successfully replicated (and the replica count increase)
3. The document is actually available on the replica
4. The document got successfully expired on the active and the expiration message got sent over DCP
5. The document was successfully expired on the replica and the item count drops back to what it used to be
6. We can verify that we didn't get an increase of wu's on the replica

I don't think it is worth shaving off 1 sec runtime for the expiration test with the risk of making all of this (more) racy.
