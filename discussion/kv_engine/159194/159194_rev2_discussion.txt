DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Move the ckpt extraction code into a dedicated function

That's the code for removing closed/unref checkpoints from the
checkpoint-list, which is currently O(N) in the size of the list and
what we aim to optimize.

This patch moves the code into its own function and runs a benchmark on
it. That will be our baseline for comparing the optimizations that will
come with the follow-up patch.

Current state:

Change-Id: Id2bb85bc71f3c259d075682a3dbae406ed286539
