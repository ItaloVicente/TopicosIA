DESCRIPTION:

MB-44168: Handle disk-write failures at DB bootstrap

At vbucket creation we generate a new couchstore file. That operation
may fail (eg IO failures) and leave a corrupted file on disk. From the
couchstore's PoV even an empty file is corrupted, as the storage will
not be able to open and work on ever again.

With this patch we introduce a bootstrap procedure that creates new
couchstore's file atomically, and we execute it when the system detects
that there is no file on disk yet for a vbucket.

The result of the new bootstrap procedure is either a new well-formed
couchstore file that contains the first header at filepos 0, or no file
at all.

Line:4211, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> does it matter that we've potentially removed a .couch.boot file before expecting we're RW?
I.e., is it intended that a RO instance is allowed to do that?

Line:4215, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Is it worth expanding this out for future readers?

Line:4248, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This looks suspicious - immediately dereferencing the RLockedPtr means revMap will be a reference to the datastructure protected by that lock, but the lock will be dropped immediately when the RLockedPtr temporary is destroyed. Is this intended?

Line:4256, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> just to confirm, there's no chance that anything else created newFile immediately after our rename failed is there? That is, by paranoid checking even after remove failed, we're not in danger of removing something we didn't create are we?

Line:4263, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> res was assigned by commit (and was success, because we checked it above) and doesn't look to have been changed since, is it useful to include here?

 "rename error:success"

might be misleading :P

Line:882, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Hmm, there might be a more descriptive name for this? Trying to think what would be most informative for someone reading code and seeing it used

Line:571, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/couch-kvstore_test.cc -> comm?

Line:4211, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This is a leftover from a previous version where steps were in slightly different order, moving at the top of the function

Line:4215, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:4248, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> So here I didn't care too much about concurrency as we are at "boot", so there shouldn't be any other component accessing the revMap entry for vbid (eg compaction). So this line was just for avoiding an inlined mess like (*dbFileRevMap->rlock())[vbid.get()].

That said, better not too speculate too much on concurrency so I m changing to make the "rename" call under revMap lock.

Line:4256, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> So that's the point, I'm proceeding by assuming that anything is possible, eg the call fails but the file is created (maybe empty?).
For example, that shouldn't be possible on *unix apart from NFS (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/renameat2.2.html). But better to be resilient to OS bugs too if that's easy to do right? :)
Note that removeFileIfExists is a NOP if the file is not there.

Line:4263, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This is a bug, fixed

Line:882, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> > there might be a more descriptive name for this

Surely there is. Just not sure how to call something that implements "check if this is the first flush and safely create the first couchstore file in case" :)
I m open to suggestions

Line:571, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/couch-kvstore_test.cc -> "commit" without going to new line, I wrongly assumed that it was clear from the context, fixing
