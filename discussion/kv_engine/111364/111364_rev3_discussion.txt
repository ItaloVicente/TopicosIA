DESCRIPTION:

MB-34770 [SR]: Skip updating ActiveDM::HPS if null topoology

If a vBucket transitions from Pending to Active via takeover, then the
initial set_vbucket_state(active) (which is sent from the source
KV-Engine node) doesn't include a replication topology. This is
expected, as the source KV-Engine doesn't know what topology should be
used for the new active node; ns_server should _shortly_ send a
follow-up set_vbucket_state(active, topology) message with the correct
topology.

However, there is a window of time between these two
set_vbukcet_state(active) messages where the newly minted ActiveDM
doesn't have a topology (and hence no chains). This exposes a bug in
ActiveDM::updateHighPreparedSeqno(), which unconditionally looked up
the current active node (via getAcive()) even through it could be
null; resulting in an expection failing:

    GSL: Precondition failure at kv_engine/engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc: 693

Solution is to simply skip any update of HighPreparedSeqno in this
window; until we have a topology we cannot track it.
