DESCRIPTION:

MB-36380 [2/2]: Fix missing Flusher wakeup

There is a a race between the Flusher completing a flush iteration and
deciding if it needs to snooze or not, and a front-end thread
notifying there's a new mutation to be flushed:

    Flusher::step()
        ...
        case State::Running:
            flushVB();
            if (_state == State::Running) {
                double tosleep = computeMinSleepTime();
    *** notifyFlushEvent() called here ***
                if (tosleep > 0) {
                    task->snooze(tosleep);
                }
         ...

* computeMinSleepTime() primarily checks if Flusher::pendingMutation is
  false, if that is the case then the flusher can be put to sleep for
  a period (between 2 and 10 seconds depending on when it last
  snoozed).

* notifyFlushEvent() does a compare-exchange on
  Flusher::pendingMutation, if successful (false -> true) then it
  calls wake().

Consider the scenario where computeMinSleepTime has returned a
non-zero value (i.e. no pending work currently), but immediately
before task->snooze() is called, notifyFlushEvent() is called by a
front-end thread. That will wake up the task, however the snooze
immediately below will effectively cancel the wake up, and the task
will be put to sleep.

If no additional notifyFlushEvent() calls occur, then the Flusher will
not be run to actually flush the outstanding work until the snooze()
expires, up to 10s.

Fix by changing the sleep / wake logic in the Flusher to be the same
as other tasks - initially put the Task to sleep (before clearing the
notification flag), perform relevent work, then at the end re-check if
any work is still required and if so wakeup the task.

If a parallel thread also attempts to wake up via notifyFlushEvent()
then that's fine - it can also wake the task.
