DESCRIPTION:

MB-28453: [4/n] MutationCommandContent needs snappy and xattr support

The steppable command will read the body_offset and system_size.

The system_size read is safe with snappy as the underlying Blob will
decompress, however the xattrSize variable will be invalid (although
patch 1 of this series may mean an exception is thrown first)
