DESCRIPTION:

MB-32535 [SR]: Record client cookie in DurabilityMonitor

The DurabilityMonitor needs to be able to notify the requesting client
connection when a SyncWrite is. completed. To do this we must record
the client's cookie in the DurabilityMonitor, as part of the SyncWrite
object.

Update DurabilityMonitor to hold this additional state; and then
ensure that the client's cookie is passed down into the Durability
Monitor when adding SyncWrites.
