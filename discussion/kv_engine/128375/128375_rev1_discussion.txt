DESCRIPTION:

MB-37680: Add support for sequential DCP Backfill

Add a new DCP_CONTROL option to allow DCP consumers to request that
backfills are scheduled in sequential order, instead of the default
round-robin order.

The new DCP_CONTROL message 'backfill_order' allows the DCP client to
choose from thw following values:

* `round-robin` - vBuckets should be backfilled in round-robin order,
  reading chunk of data from each in turn. This is the default value
  (and the behaviour of DCP BackfillManager before this change).

* `sequential` - vBuckets should be backfilled sequentially - _all_
  data from the first vBucket should be read from disk before
  advancing to the next vBucket.
