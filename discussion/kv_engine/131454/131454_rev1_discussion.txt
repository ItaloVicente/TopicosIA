DESCRIPTION:

MB-24075: Replace sleep from ~HashTable with Expects(visitors==0)

The sleep in ~HashTable is unnecessary, all visitors to the HashTable
have a ref-counted pointer on the VBucket, a HashTable should not
destruct whilst any visit methods are executing.

Change-Id: Ib9b87f48248d5190a9e415945d790fa5897d56f3
