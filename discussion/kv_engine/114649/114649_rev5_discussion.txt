Line:1415, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> I don't believe this is correct - it's possible to "re-delete" an item which is already deleted, which will result in the delete count not changing.

ep_testsuite.cc/test_takeover_stats_num_persisted_deletes inserts 1 deleted item and then validates that the item is counted as a persisted delete. Therefore, any item which is marked as deleted is counted as a persisted delete.

Line:1415, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> So for couchstore, persistedDeletes is simply the number of elements in the B-Tree which are marked as deleted - so if a single key is:

1) Created.
2) Deleted.
3) Re-deleted (with say a different value associated with it).

Then the deleteCount after 3 should be 1.

From your code above it looks like in Magma it will be 2.

I suggest you look for a unit test which re-deletes a document (likely some related to XATTRs and deleted bodies) and confirm what Magma's behaviour in that situation is.

Could you point me to a test which does a re-delete and checks persisted deletes? I have no test failures so no clue as to where to look.

Also, this method of tracking persisted deletes seems a bit dubious.
Why does a delete of a non existent item count as a persisted delete but a delete of a delete does not?

Because it's a count of elements which currently have the property deleted==true; not a count of of how many delete operations have happened over the life of the vBucket.

If its a count of a the # of items which have the property deleted=true, how is that defined? How can a non existent item have a property of deleted and an item that is deleted twice only count for 1 delete? That seems inconsistent.

Because deleted (aka tombstoned) documents are kept in couchstore until the metadata purge interval (default 3 days).

Great... why isn't a delete of a delete also tracked? Especially if its for a different value? Why does it seem inconsistent on which delete's are tracked and which are not? We don't remove the delete of a delete during compaction (at least as far as I can tell in time_purge_hook) so it stays in storage until expired.

I think you're mis-understanding how deletes work.

Couchstore is (in how KV-Engine uses it) a single-key, single value store - a Map (not multi-map) if you will.

As such, a single key can either be one of 3 classes:

a) Non-Existent - no data is stored for it, it is literally the absence of an entry in the B-tree which defines this class.
b) Alive - it has a key, a single value (plus some metadata), and the deleted field in the metadata is false.
c) Deleted - it has a key, _possibly_ a value (for system XATTRs), and the deleted field in the metadata is true.

Documents in state Deleted stay in that state until they are either re-created (change to Alive), or the metadata purge interval (default 3 days) passes since they were last deleted, at which point they become Non-Existent.

The getNumPersistedDeletes() method returns the number of documents in the vBucket which are in state Deleted.

As such, it doesn't make any sense care about how many times a document has been deleted (or what the state transition is), all that is relevant is how many documents are currently in that state.

There _are_ other counters (in ep-engine) which give a _cumulative_ number of delete operations against the vbucket, but that's different to the number provided by the storage engine.

In terms of tests, take a look at test_delete_with_value - that might be a suitable test to check the result of getNumPersistedDeletes() between each call.
