DESCRIPTION:

Add kv_trace_merge

Add engines/ep/management/kv_trace_merge - a script to merge multiple
Google Trace Event files (as produced by kv_trace_dump) into a single
file.

This can be useful to aggregate trace files from multiple memcached
processes - e.g. multiple nodes on the same machine via
cluster_run to see cross-node events such as DCP.
