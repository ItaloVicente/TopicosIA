DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Throttle RangeScan create/continue

Move the opcodes so that they are subject to throttling.

Cancel is deliberately not throttled, the reasoning here is that
a cancel should free resources, possibly a significant amount of
disk and as such should be allowed to execute even when throttled.
