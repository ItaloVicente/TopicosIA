DESCRIPTION:

MB-25700: Move devnull on the stack

This change prevents writing to devnull from multiple threads, which
used to cause the thread sanitizer to warn about a race. The
suppresion rule for drain_notification_channel() can now be removed.

Line:251, daemon/thread.cc -> Why is this reduced to 512 ? Can you add that in the summary ?

Line:251, daemon/thread.cc -> We don't want to blow the stack... AFAIK the default stack size on windows is 1MB . Given that we loop it only means that we'll "potentially" will call recv more times..

So when does this happen? Every time we want to notify another thread we send 1 byte to it's notification pipe. When the thread is waken up, it'll try to drain the notification channel, before executing all of the new events. That means that the other threads (listener and other background threads) may notify this thread 512 times since the last time we checked the notification pipe before we'll start draining the pipe. (it would have been nice if we could just tell the kernel to drop all of the data ;-))

Actually: Can you copy some of the information I put in the comment into the commit message to make it easier available for people? (or make it a comment in the method... that's probably even better)
