DESCRIPTION:

MB-46046: [2/5] Introduce cb::iterator_range

Provides a simple container for two iterators (or an iterator and a
sentinel) representing a range.

Exposes begin() and end(), and may be used to return a value useable in
a range-based for loop, e.g.,

 for (const auto& foo: bar.some_view()) {...}

Useful if a class provides multiple, logically different ways of
iterating over its contents.
