DESCRIPTION:

MB-29377: [1/n] Improve spdlog usage within kv_engine

[1]: Add isInitialized method to cb::logger and use this in
     auditd.cc instead of cb::logger::get
[2]: Replace usage of cb::logger::get in connection.cc with
     the LOG_* macros
[3]: Add variations of the logger::initialize method to
     allow for configuration of the log level directly from
     the initialization phase
[4]: Replace usage of cb::logger::get in memcached.cc with
     the LOG_* macros
