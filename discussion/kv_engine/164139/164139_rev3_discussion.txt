DESCRIPTION:

[cluster_test] Reuse the same set of memcached processes

Don't restart memcached per test batch, but just recreate
the test bucket for each test batch (starting and stopping
memcached is slow compared to the actual test execution)

(for a single shot of cluster_test one won't notice a huge difference, but when using --gtest_repeat=1000 on windows it is like night and day)

We only have a handful of cluster test suites (7 that I could see this morning). Does this make a big difference?
Line:45, tests/testapp_cluster/clustertest.cc -> Should we not be doing this in SetUp and TearDown?

Line:45, tests/testapp_cluster/clustertest.cc -> No.. we don't want to recreate the bucket for every test case. If you _need_ a different bucket in a test case you should create it in the test case.

By keeping it in SetUpTestCase one may create buckets with a special replication filter etc (such test cases could of course have created their own bucket to operate on, but this was the "least" amount of work to reuse the process without having to rewrite tue upgrade test ;)

Line:45, tests/testapp_cluster/clustertest.cc -> If you need a different bucket, sure. But is it not reasonable to expect that each test case starts with an empty bucket? We'll be seeing items from previous test cases in the bucket won't we?

I guess this is slightly tangential to the original intent of this change

Line:45, tests/testapp_cluster/clustertest.cc -> I'm tempted to say that if one really wants that one could create one.. if you don't care you can use the one we already have.

Bucket creation / deletion takes time and is typically significantly slower than the actual test being run (most of them just execute a handfull of commands to the server and it is only a few which actually waits for persistence of items so they operate at the speed of memory, not disk).

Initially the engine_testapp idea was that each test should start off in a clean environment, but over time that also got way too slow when we added more and more tests so we wanted to speed them up.

Line:45, tests/testapp_cluster/clustertest.cc -> Fair enough. I suppose it already behaves like this but it's the behaviour I'd have expected.

Only other comment here is what performance benefit (real world numbers) does this overall change give us? Would be good to add that to the commit message

Line:45, tests/testapp_cluster/clustertest.cc -> For a single-shot run (as run by CV) the change is minimal as the actual shutdown of memcached can take up to a sec for the "tick" to detect that it should shut down (as the signal handler just set an atomic flag which is picked up by the various front end threads).

when running with --gtest_repeat=<number> on _windows_ trying to find a issue the difference is like night and day.. When running with --gtest_repeat=2 the time went from 37 sec to 14 sec...
