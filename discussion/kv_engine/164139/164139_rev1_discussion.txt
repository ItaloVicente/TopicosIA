DESCRIPTION:

[cluster_test] Reuse the same set of memcached processes

Don't restart memcached per test batch, but just recreate
the test bucket for each test batch (starting and stopping
memcached is slow compared to the actual test execution)

Change-Id: I5e52c35c5897e992956ee2bd686a11bdd9af304d
