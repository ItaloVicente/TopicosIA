DESCRIPTION:

Test adding per-bucket default hazptr

MB-50546 found that folly hazptrs (or folly classes which use it
internally, like UnboundedQueue) can lead to stats issues by
deallocating memory under a different bucket than it was allocated
under.

This occurred because objects from all buckets (and no bucket) which
are protected by hazptrs are retired to the default domain, then later
potentially deallocated by whatever thread pushes the list of retired
objects over a certain threshold.

This lead to objects being allocated for no-bucket (e.g., for the
executor pool task queues) but deallocated by chance under a bucket.
This eventually drove mem_used below zero for the affected buckets.

Specialise the function used to get the default hazptr domain and check
ObjectRegistry for the current engine, and return an engine-specific
domain if present.

Not a "proper" solution, as folly doesn't advertise this as an intended
customisation point so it's likely to break with future folly changes,
but pushing in case it is useful to reference in the future.

Folly may add support for specified domains to the queues and cohorts
in the future, so there may be a "proper" route to per-bucket domains
one day.
