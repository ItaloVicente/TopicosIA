DESCRIPTION:

MB-52311: [4/n] Pause / Resume Bucket: KVStore impl

Implement handling of Pause & ResumeBucket commands in KVStore impls:

- CouchKVStore: Nothing to do really as there's no background tasks
  (other than ones ep-engine itself schedules and knows about)

- MagmaKVStore: Need to call down to request Magma stops any in-flight
  background tasks, then resume those on Unpause.

- NexusKVStore: Call down to the child stores.

- RocksDBKVStore: Not implemented given it's an experimental backend.
