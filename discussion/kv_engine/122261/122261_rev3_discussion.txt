DESCRIPTION:

MB-37917: Reset initialDiskSnapshot flag on transition to active

Currently we will reset the initialDiskSnapshot flag of a vBucket when
we transition from replica to non-replica. The intent of this change
was to ensure that if we transition to active without having received
a full snapshot then we would allow consumers to stream from us. This
does not consider that we may receive our initial disk snapshot whilst
we are a pending vBucket though. We should instead reset this flag
whenever we transition to active as we are now the source of truth and
should allow streaming from this vBucket.
