DESCRIPTION:

MB-45917: Use correct "diskSize" for compaction after an upgrade

The collection diskSize does not exist in 6.5 couchstore files, so
the code uses dbinfo.space_used (as only the default collection
exists, this is a reasonable over-estimate).

During 7.0 compaction the collection diskSize stat must be updated
if tombstones are purged and MB-45917 identified a problem in
compaction where the collection stats are read from the new file,
which is generally fine except in the case where an upgrade just
occurred, because the disk-size is set to the space_used of the
compacted file.

If compaction has just purged many tombstones the space_used can be
small and the purged-byte counter large -> underflow.

Fix this by updating couchstore so that both source/target Db& are
passed to the precommit hook and then read the stats from the source.
Now we will subtract from a large size and not underflow the disk
size.

A second fix is included that was found in the added unit-test where
the on_disk_prepares was accessed but not present. This could be an
issue with the unit test hooks, but the code is now more robust if a
path is possible where we get to 7.0 without that field present in
vbstate.

Line:32, /COMMIT_MSG -> offline upgrade of 6.0 to 7.0 then an immediate compaction would do the trick? Although the first flush of vbstate in warmup may 'solve', but anyway more robust now.

Line:1085, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> 'feels' like the json lookup/get and std::stoul complexity is not saving much just to avoid one assignment (and to_string)
