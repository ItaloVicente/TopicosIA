DESCRIPTION:

MB-36894: Turn ep unit tests back on for magma

Some changes have been made to magma start up and shutdown faster.
See MB-33463.

Also impacting test behavior is CBSS-326 which delays delays magma
memory allocations for non participating shards.

Magma typically runs slower than couchstore because magma has more
infrastructure to instantiate when a shard is spun up and a vbucket
is created. Since these are unit tests, the majority of test time
is spent doing startup and shutdown rather than the actual test.

In some cases, like ep_testsuite_basic, magma runtime is consistently
faster.  In other cases, like ep_testsuite_dcp, magma runtime has
a huge varience where sometimes it runs 30% faster and sometimes
it experiences a timeout.  The variance seems to be caused by what
tests are running in parallel with the other tests, how busy the
bare metal box is where the vm / build bot is running tests and an
occasional missing stat that causes a timeout.

Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> We should probably look into this - and if there isn't an explicit problem then maybe only re-enable the test with an increased timeout. I don't want to trigger more timeouts during CV when this is re-enabled.

What would you like me to look into? I've run the entire suites at least 100+ times. I've done code path profiles. There has been at least 1 checkin to make magma go faster, but its still slower than couchstore for the reasons given. Please let me know what other analysis you want.

I'd like to know what percentage of times CV times out. If it's say more than 5% then I suggest increasing the timeouts of the relevant suites such that any timeout is rare (but still guards against hangs etc).
