DESCRIPTION:

MB-36894: Turn ep unit tests back on for magma

Some changes have been made to magma start up and shutdown faster.
See MB-33463.

Also impacting test behavior is CBSS-326 which delays delays magma
memory allocations for non participating shards.

Magma typically runs slower than couchstore because magma has more
infrastructure to instantiate when a shard is spun up and a vbucket
is created. Since these are unit tests, the majority of test time
is spent doing startup and shutdown rather than the actual test.

In some cases, like ep_testsuite_basic, magma runtime is consistently
faster.  In other cases, like ep_testsuite_dcp, magma runtime has
a huge varience where sometimes it runs 30% faster and sometimes
it experiences a timeout.  The variance seems to be caused by what
tests are running in parallel with the other tests, how busy the
bare metal box is where the vm / build bot is running tests and an
occasional missing stat that causes a timeout.
