DESCRIPTION:

MB-36894: Turn ep unit tests back on for magma

Some changes have been made to magma start up and shutdown faster.
See MB-33463.

Also impacting test behavior is CBSS-326 which delays delays magma
memory allocations for non participating shards.

Magma typically runs slower than couchstore because magma has more
infrastructure to instantiate when a shard is spun up and a vbucket
is created. Since these are unit tests, the majority of test time
is spent doing startup and shutdown rather than the actual test.

In some cases, like ep_testsuite_basic, magma runtime is consistently
faster.  In other cases, like ep_testsuite_dcp, magma runtime has
a huge varience where sometimes it runs 30% faster and sometimes
it experiences a timeout.  The variance seems to be caused by what
tests are running in parallel with the other tests, how busy the
bare metal box is where the vm / build bot is running tests and an
occasional missing stat that causes a timeout.

Patch Set 4:

I was going to try running the tests over and over by simply commenting/uncommenting a line to show the tests don't timeout. Unfortunately, the tests are so fragile that getting them to pass a single iteration requires multiple runs. Take for instance this run... there is a timeout, but on the windows build, not the test run. And I hit the module test thread sanitizer rocks issue over and over. Not quite sure why there are any tests run under rocks and thread sanitizer since its been disabled for all the ep tests. Since I can't prove the timeout issue is fixed because of issues other than magma, what do you suggest?

In the case of the RocksDB TSan failure, looks like you're hitting https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36529 - which we simply haven't got to investigating yet given the current focus on Mad-Hatter.

Personally I would look at the runtimes of each test suite you are attempting to re-enable under CV, and check that the timeout value is at least 2-3x a "normal" runtime. For example, looking at the results from your CV Windows run: http://cv.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/kv_engine-windows-master/24899/testReport/projectroot.engines.ep/tests/

Here ep_testsuite_checkpoint.value_eviction.magma took 69s, but the couchstore variants (ep_testsuite_checkpoint.value_eviction.comp_active and ep_testsuite_checkpoint.value_eviction.comp_passive) took 22s - so Magma seems to be ~3x slower for this suite.

However, you're using the same timeout (120s) for both Magma and couchstore. I suggest you increase the timeout for the magma variant to say 3minutes.

You can do a similar check for the other tests you're turning back on.
Line:330, programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc -> Looks like duplicated, commented out code - please remove.
