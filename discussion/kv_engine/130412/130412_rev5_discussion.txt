DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Add constructors for system event code paths

Profiling of kv-engine showed itemAllocate was calling getCollectionID
alongside StoredValue::toItemBase, all of these calls were coming
from the code which is deciding what value to give to the Item's
operation.

All frontend Item constructor calls for mutations will not generate
system events, so inspecting the key is not required. Similarly
for toItemBase on persistent buckets.

This patch introduces new constructors (using tags) for the code
paths which do or may generate system events.

* disk/memory backfill (hence new toItemBase for SV vs OSV)
* collection event generation (systemevent.cc)

Change-Id: I37cee0468fdf84496d806e566e506a3945eb3fa5

think i'll re-do this patch, CV failure have come from where i've missed a "MightBeSystem" tag, it will be safer and easier if we flip this, so normal Item construction does the isSystemEvent stuff and only the places where we know it's safe to not do that can use a speical "NotSystem" tag, e.g. itemAllocate
