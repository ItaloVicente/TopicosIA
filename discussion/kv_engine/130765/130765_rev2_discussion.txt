DESCRIPTION:

MB-39993: [Ephemeral] Handle delete_time < server startup time

There's a bug in how we handle replicating an item's deletion time
over DCP, if the item was deleted before destination node started. The
effect of this is that the deletion time of the item on the replica is
set to memcached uptime + 1, and hence won't be subject to metadata
purging until the entire purge interval has passed, even if the actual
item was deleted a long time ago.

The consequence of this is that on Ephemeral buckets, deletions
earlier than server startup received by a replica vBucket will not be
purged at the correct time. Instead their purge is delayed until
server_startup + metadata purge interval.

This occurs because the delete_time in StoredValue is represented as
rel_time_t - i.e. seconds since server started. As such, it is not
possible to represent delete times earlier than the server startup
time. If such a rel_time_t is attempted to be created, then
mc_time_convert_to_real_time() returns a value of "1" (since server
startup):

   /* if item expiration is at/before the server started, give it an
      expiration time of 1 second after the server started.
      (because 0 means don't expire).  without this, we'd
      underflow and wrap around to some large value way in the
      future, effectively making items expiring in the past
      really expiring never */
   if (t <= epoch) {
       rv = (rel_time_t)1;
   }

To address this, StoredValue::delete_time is changed from rel_time_t,
to time_t (seconds since Unix epoch). This allows delete times before
the server startup to be represented, and hence correctly purged.

Implementation Note:

Using rel_time_t and time_t is error-prone, as they are just typedefs
to the same underlying type (uint32_t) and hence the compiler won't
help you if you directly assign one to the other. When this is merged
to master I plan to introduce strongly-typed clocks for each which
_will_ prevent any such accidental conversion, however that would
significantly incease the scope of this fix so not doing that here.
