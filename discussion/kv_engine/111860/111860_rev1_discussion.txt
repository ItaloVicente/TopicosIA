DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Capture vbucket id in DurabilityMonitor throw messages

It would be useful to capture the vbucket id in throws messages to
assist debugging issues, for example the following exception is
seen in MB-34956

"ActiveDurabilityMonitor::processSeqnoAck: seqno(20371) is greater than lastTrackedSeqno(0)"

Having the vbucket of that ADM could be useful.

This patch lifts throwException from the collection's VB::Manifest code
and modifies it for use in ADM/PDM. The code attempts to avoid the use
of any non-standard macros, so __func__ is used over __FUNCTION__ or
__PRETTY_FUNCTION.

With this change the above throw message now becomes (if vb was 67)

"ActiveDurabilityMonitor::processSeqnoAck: vb:67 seqno(20371) is greater than lastTrackedSeqno(0)"
