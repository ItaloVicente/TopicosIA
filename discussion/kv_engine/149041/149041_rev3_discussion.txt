DESCRIPTION:

Add adjustMemcachedClock to avoid creating a new connection

XAttrTest tried to adjust the server time, and for that it
used the helper method to do that. Unfortunately that call
used the global socket which means we had to open an extra
connection just for that.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

adjust_memcached_clock is used in a few other places, and for what I understand you aim to remove that, so we can get rid of that completely here

I don't want to make a jumbo patch fixing all references at the same time. This allows for removal one place and now I don't need to create the extra connection for the usecases in this method.

There seem to be just 3/4 other calls to adjust_memcached_clock.. you have added the new Connection::adjustMemCachedClock, so you just need to replace the call with that.
Do you need anything else for removing the adjust_memcached_clock function ?

The plan is to migrate them over as we go. Currently those tests operate on that socket and the intention was to migrate the test over to the new api and the method in one step

(If I flip over the others now those calls will then create a new connection to the server)
