Line:65, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> we should catch the abstract std::exception as open can throw more than ReadException

Line:70, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> Are you confident that you want to execute this after an exception? Will it always yield false?

You also need to write a regression test for this.
Line:65, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> e isn't modified - can catch by const reference.

Line:68, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> Given the open has failed; it's unlikely we can safely continue. We should instead stop, which may require propagating the error up to the caller (so they can handle it).

In this case; you probably want to actually let this exception be thrown from the constructor (ItemAccessVisitor). In C++ exceptions have a powerful use with object creation - if you throw in a constructor then the object is not actually constructed. 

Suggest you look where the ItemAccessVisitor object is created from; perform the catch there and abort the visitation in an appropriate way.
