DESCRIPTION:

MB-27621: Stop server crash when trying to open an access log with an
invalid path

To do this we wrap the entire set up of the task in a try-catch and
log the exception produced if the creation fails. This allows the
task to be reshecduled at a later date.

Also adds an associated test.

Line:316, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> Reading this again (and it's actually a benefit of breaking the large function into smaller sub-functions) - we probably shouldn't give up on all shards if one of them happened to fail - we might still succeed in creating the access log for other shards. 

As such, I don't think we should break here.

Line:377, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> This is a good opportunity to mention the path which was used - the user can check it matches what they think they specified.

Line:50, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.h -> Style: We generally don't bother adding a `const` modified to arguments of primitives types passed by value - as the argument is copied; it's of limited value to tag it as const.

(no need to change now).

Line:1134, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> Style: Again, not prescriptive, but one convention we've used is to name such methods `public_nameOfOriginalMethod` - this makes it pretty explicit that we are  calling a special forwarding method on the mock (compared to some method inherited from the base class).
