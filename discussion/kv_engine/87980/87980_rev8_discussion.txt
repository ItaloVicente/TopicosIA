DESCRIPTION:

MB-27621: Stop server crash when trying to open an access log with an
invalid path

To do this we wrap the entire set up of the task in a try-catch and
log the exception produced if the creation fails. This allows the
task to be reshecduled at a later date.

Also adds an associated test.

Line:340, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> The error message here could be improved - for example what action should the user take as a result? 

There's a good blog post (slightly UI-centric) here (https://medium.com/@thomasfuchs/how-to-write-an-error-message-883718173322) which discusses the topic; but the summary is:

> Write actionable error messages that laypeople can understand.

(The 'laypeople' part is maybe less relevant to us.)

Line:1130, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> The approach you have here is fine; but for future changes consider making it easier to test the code (so you don't have to "jump through hoops" to get the code to run the way you want).

For example, you could have changed the run() method to extract the actual task creation and scheduling into a separate, protected method. This maintains the public interface (users can still only drive it via `run()`); but allows test code to directly call the specific code you want to test. "How does test code call the protected method?" you may ask - well a common pattern is to define a Mock subclass of the class in question (which has access to protected methods); and the mock in turn adds a public method which simply calls the protected one.

Line:1141, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> Style: One nice feature of GTest's ASSERT / EXPECT macros (and technically you should use EXPECT_NO_THROW here) is that you can specify a message to be printed if the test fails. As such, you can use that to document the expected behaviour / reason something is checked instead of an inline comment - as the message is both visible when reading the code, *and* when running the test and it fails.

For example:

 EXPECT_NO_THROW(task->run()) << "AccessScanner threw "
     "unexpected exception when access log path does not exist.";
