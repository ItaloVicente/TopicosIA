DESCRIPTION:

MB-47687: Add triggerImplicitCompaction and createCheckpoint to MockMagmaKVStore

Both these APIs are meant to be used for testing.
triggerImplicitCompaction will make it easier to test
Magma's background compaction. Atm we write a bunch of
tiny files to do this.
newCheckpoint will us to test Magma's rollback without
having to create a rollback point for every write.
