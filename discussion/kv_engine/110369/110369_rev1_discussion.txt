DESCRIPTION:

MB-34474: Do not send commit for de-duped prepares to replica

In the case where we de-dupe a prepare on the resumption of a
stream, a consumer would recieve a commit message for which it
would not have a corresponding prepare. This is an issue as
we do not have the corresponding value to commit. In this case,
we will instead send the consumer a normal mutation. This carries
all of the information required to "commit" the value and will not
be blocked with InFlightSyncWrite as logically the consumer would not
have a prepare pending.
