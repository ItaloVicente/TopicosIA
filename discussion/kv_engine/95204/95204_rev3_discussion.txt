DESCRIPTION:

MB-29861: Generate a delete time for a deletion during backfill

Deletes need to have delete time set in the expiry field, so that
during compaction tombstones will be purged after a specified
purge interval. But delete times were only being generated in
the checkpoint manager and were not generated for deletes that
were received during a disk backfill, thus causing delete time
to be set as 0. Fix this by also generating the delete time
for those backfill deletes.
