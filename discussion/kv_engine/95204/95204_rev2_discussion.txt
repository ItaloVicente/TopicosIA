DESCRIPTION:

MB-29816: Generate a delete time for a deletion during backfill

Deletes need to have delete time set in the expiry field, so that
during compaction tombstones will be purged after a specified
purge interval. But delete times were only being generated in
the checkpoint manager and were not generated for deletes that
were received during a disk backfill, thus causing delete time
to be set as 0. Fix this by also generating the delete time
for those backfill deletes.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Typo: I think this should be MB-29861.

Line:739, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Note we have similar code in CheckpointManager::queueDirty (as added by http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/88301/17/engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc). Can we unify this so we only update the time in a single place - say just after creating the queued_item  at line 716?
