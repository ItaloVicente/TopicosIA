DESCRIPTION:

MB-44590: ScanContext startSeqno should not always be 0

Noted as part of MB-44694 an exception message that printed the
ScanContext showed the startSeqno was 0. This was incorrect and
down to the default initialisation of 0 and later use of std::min.

With this change we now correctly set the startSeqno so that the
seqno range check now correctly skips items not in the dropped
range.
