DESCRIPTION:

MB-32385: Adjust usleep in test_bug2509

As introduced in http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/3088/, this test
aims to trigger the deletion of a document inbetween it's
persistence insertion and it's ID set. As it's a time-dependent
issue, a usleep is used to attempt to hit the correct point to
delete the item. This results in 200ms of usleeping guaranteed for
the test, which typically takes ~700ms to complete locally.
By adjusting the usleep time to depend on the loop, we can both
reduce the amount of time the test usleeps for (around half the
time) and also check multiple shorter time gaps; as within the
8 years since this test was written the window for this issue has
likely shrunk due to performance improvements.
