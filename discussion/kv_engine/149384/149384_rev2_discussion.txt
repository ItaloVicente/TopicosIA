Line:706, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Is this message correct? '*hcs` is being printed as "trying to set PCS to X" ?

(I know it was wrong previously...)

Line:719, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> ditto.

Line:706, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Think so a hcs is an std::optional<uint64_t> that's set in side this function based on the contents of toFlush.items. As we're about to set proposedVBState.persistedCompletedSeqno = *hcs. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding your comment?

Line:706, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Hmm, maybe it's fine - the variable names are confusing - "proposedVBstate" sounds like that's what we are proposing to set (i.e. not the "current" value). maybe have whoever added this check 😊

Line:706, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> I think it started out as the proposedVbstate as we modify it during this function before persisting it. It might be better for us to check against the persisted vbucket state if present just for clarity. So `if (hcs <= proposedVBState.persistedCompletedSeqno) {` would become `if (persistedVbState && hcs <= persistedVbState->persistedCompletedSeqno) {`
