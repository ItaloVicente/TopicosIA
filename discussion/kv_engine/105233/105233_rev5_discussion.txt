DESCRIPTION:

Share MemoryTrackingAllocator for all checkpoints

As we are interested in the total checkpoint memory usage, we can use
the same instance of the memory tracking allocator for all checkpoints.
This will make it easier to implement a future patch where we intend to
use splice to move items out of a checkpoint queue into an expelled
queue.

As splice moves items between containers by just adjusting pointers, if
the containers are using difference allocators the memory usage
accounting breaks.

For example, adding an item to a memory tracked container will call the
allocate method and increment the bytesAllocated.  If splice moves
the item to another memory tracked container that's using a differenct
MemoryTrackingAllocator its allocate method is not called, and therefore
its bytesAllocated remains 0.

On destruction the original container will have nothing to delete and
so bytesAllocates will remain non-zero.  Whilst the container holding
the item will invoke delete and try to decrement bytesAllocated which is
already at 0.

A test has been added to demonstrate that splice works when using the
same MemoryTrackingAllocator.
