DESCRIPTION:

Share MemoryTrackingAllocator for all checkpoints

Previously we created a MemoryTrackingAllocator for each checkpoint.

As we are interested in the total checkpoint memory usage, we can use
the same instance of the memory tracking allocator for all checkpoints.

This will make it easier to implement a future patch where we intend to
use splice to move items out of a checkpoint queue into an expelled
queue.
