DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: Fixes to use TaggedPtr with SingleThreadedRCPtr

Experimenting setting a tag using a TaggedPtr within
SingleThreadedRCPtr identified an issue where we were testing if
Pointer was valid by just seeing if it was zero.

This patches changes bool function to first clear the tag before
comparing it with zero.  It also adds an associated test.

In addition, to make the code more uniform in SingleThreadedRCPtr, when
a pointer comparison is made it uses explict nullptr checks.  It also
simplifies pointer checks in the Item class by invoking the
SingleThreadedRCPtr bool method.
