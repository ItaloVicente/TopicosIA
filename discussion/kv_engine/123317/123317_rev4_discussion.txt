DESCRIPTION:

Minor refactor of doScopeStats and doCollectionStats

Small reordering to favour early exits (in accordance with the coding
standards) to be consistent with and to prepare for a following patch.

Among other minor changes, move to using std::string_view to avoid
string copies, and try to limit nesting by preferring early exits in
accordance with the coding standards.
