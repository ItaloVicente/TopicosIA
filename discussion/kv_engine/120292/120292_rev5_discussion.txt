DESCRIPTION:

MB-37468: Force notification of stream completing backfill

A stream completing a backfill may race with a stepping producer.
The stream may have just completed the backfill (scanned all items
but not yet completed execution of the completeBackfill function)
whilst the producer steps finds nothing in the readyQueue (already
processed all items). If the completing backfill does not notify the
stream as the itemsReady flag has not yet been reset (by the stepping
producer) then the producer will remove the stream from it's
VBReadyQueue and not process it again. Nothing else would notify
the stream causing us to fail to process the final StreamEnd item.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit its

Line:379, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> In some other cases the hook is initalised with an empty lambda 

nextHook = []{};

then called unconditionally.

Though really it's only in one place so its not like it affects readability to do the if(), and I don't know what level of perf impact the other way has.

Just mentioning :)

Line:575, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> does the racing next() not clear the flag _after_ the next line - this call here fails to notify because it is still true, then it is quickly cleared after?

That is, isn't it:

backfillPhase() finds isBackfillTaskRunning is true, but nothing in readyQueue, returns nullptr to the caller which is next()

this unlocked section here runs, clearing isBackfillTaskRunning, _tries_ to notify, but _does not_ because itemsReady is already true (the CES in notifyStreamReady returns false because itemsReady is not in the expected state false, so it did not update it)

next() sees it got a nullptr, clears itemsReady, returns the nullptr to the producer which believes the stream has no more work, so doesn't call it again.

I agree with the fix, just wanted to check the sequence of events in the comment :P

Line:164, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> I would say new method without comment, but it is trivial to see what it does :P

Line:4276, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Just to be suuuupper certain, can ephemeral *definitely* not get in the same situation?

Line:4326, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> ...? The test exits early if ephemeral

additional ephemeral test incoming, but feel free to review again
Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:379, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Gonna leave as is, just for the sake of not worrying about any potential perf impact

Line:575, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> yeah think it was wrong before.

Line:164, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> which is why I didn't add a comment :) I would normally comment then separate declaration and definition but alice doesn't have a mock_stream.cc and the merge is gonna suck as is.

Line:4276, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> I thought it couldn't but I think it is possible in theory so will have a play with testing that

Line:4326, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> oops, old comment

Line:379, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Sounds good :thumbsup:
