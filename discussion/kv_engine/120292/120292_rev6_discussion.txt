DESCRIPTION:

MB-37468: Force notification of stream completing backfill

A stream completing a backfill may race with a stepping producer.
The stream may have just completed the backfill (scanned all items
but not yet completed execution of the completeBackfill function)
whilst the producer steps finds nothing in the readyQueue (already
processed all items). If the completing backfill does not notify the
stream as the itemsReady flag has not yet been reset (by the stepping
producer) then the producer will remove the stream from its
VBReadyQueue and not process it again. Nothing else would notify
the stream causing us to fail to process the final StreamEnd item.

Line:4370, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> which of the many endStream calls is the one that inserts the end marker in this test?

Line:4370, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> the one at line 4340. I commented it, moved the test, and removed the extra unnecessary ones

Line:4370, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> sorry, I mean from within ActiveStream - I was following the test against the stream.cc code and couldn't see which endStream gets invoked, i.e. we have one in transitionState, one in inMemoryPhase etc...

I just want to review the call site for the lost notification

Line:4370, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> ahh my bad. The one that we should hit is in backfillPhase when the backfill task is not running, readyQueue is empty, pendingBackfill is false, and we have sent up to the end seqno. Should be line 711 of stream.cc

Line:4370, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> thanks, just makes me wonder why endStream never does a notifyStreamReady.  IIIRC when something is added to the readyQueue notify should be called, the notifyStreamReady you did change to do a force, just looks out of place, I cannot recall why completeBackFill has a notify when it doesn't push anything ...  something to  ponder

Line:4370, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> In stream to infinity streams complete backfill notifies to wake the stream so it will run backfill phase one more time to transition to in memory (I guess)

Line:4370, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> unfortunately in this case a notify in endStream wouldn't save us as we don't actually make the endStream call in this race condition without forcing the notify in completeBackfill
