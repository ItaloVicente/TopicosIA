DESCRIPTION:

MB-29481: Refactor out CheckpointTest class into header file

In preparation for creating tests for checkpoint removal/cursor dropping,
refactor out the CheckpointTest class and associated helper code into
its own header file, as much of the new test will be built on top of
this framework.

File Comment: engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.h -> If you're going to move this into it's own header file; then I'd move the inline methods to be in the .cc; that should allow you to significantly reduce the #include footprint of this file.

(Recall your header reduction work previously; we don't want to force users of this class to necessarily pull in it's implementation / dependancies also).
Line:40, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.h -> Avoid adding #defines to the global namespace - either move them to the .cc; or if you need them in the header then implement as static const member variables of the class.
