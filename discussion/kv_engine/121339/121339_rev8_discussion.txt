DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Early-return if persist-vbstate-only in EPB::flushVBucket

Just return if we have already persisted a new vbstate and it was the
only thing to persist.
Ensure that all the expected post-flush operations are performed.

This is one of the last simplifications in the function. Mainly this
makes clear what part of the function is not executed if the
flush-batch is empty.

Line:704, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Not very keen on this local lambda, especially given it captures most of the world. Can we restructure so we just call this code once (as it used to be?)

Line:704, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> I know that this is not perfect, I would like to improve it too.


Essentially the (long) end of this function performs some steps that are required only if we have flushed some non-meta items (1st case).
Other steps must be performed even if we have flushed only set-vbucket (2nd case).
Then the 3rd case is when the flush fails. In this case doing some stats is even wrong (see the left-side of this view, line 786).
Then the 4th case: no flush at all.


This lambda helps in addressing all the points above, also by performing steps only when they are necessary.
For catching that better, it is easier to look at the follow-up patch http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/121341/4/engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc , which is the final result of this serie of changes.


I've tried to re-touch this change for doing what you suggests, but I end up with if-else blocks again.
Given our recent findings in this function, I would stick with simplicity and clearness :)

What do you think?


Final note.
One of the issues that adds complexity to this function is that snapshotVBucket() may flush or not. At master we have solved that (snapshotVBucket() just saves the new vbstate for flushing, but it doesn't commit anything). So we can easily commit once (and only if required).
That would probably help in removing this lambda without re-introducing to much complexity. I'll definitely look at the at mh->master merge if you're happy to keep this at mh.


Final final note :)
That's true that the lambda captures many things, but it performs just stats + a few of logical steps.

Line:704, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Agreed on just making the function a non-lambda
