DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Early-return if persist-vbstate-only in EPB::flushVBucket

Just return if we have already persisted a new vbstate and it was the
only thing to persist.
Ensure that all the expected post-flush operations are performed.

This is one of the last simplifications in the function. Mainly this
makes clear what part of the function is not executed if the
flush-batch is empty.
