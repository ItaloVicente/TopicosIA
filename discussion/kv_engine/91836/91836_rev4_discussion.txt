DESCRIPTION:

MB-28941: Tracing: Remove begin/end indirection via TRACING_API

To record a trace start/end, currently the following indirection
occurs (starting from the ScopedTracer RAII object):

    ScopedTracer -> serverAPI.begin_trace -> cookie.getTracer().begin()

However, the indirection via serverAPI is essentially pointless - the
actual Tracer object is owned by the cookie, so it's unnecessary to
bounce via the Server API to access it.

Remove this intermediate step. This results in the following ~7% speedup
(aside from the overall simplification):

Line:47, tracing/trace_helpers.h -> Isn’t this a cookie?

It look like they have the same layout in memory, but this leads to a fragile piece of code as someone may change one of them. It world probably be better to promote the cookie interface....

Line:47, tracing/trace_helpers.h -> Yes, but Traceable is the base class (and the only interface we need to use here).

What do you mean by "promote the cookie interface" - move it back to a similar function but in SERVER_COOKIE_API ?

Line:47, tracing/trace_helpers.h -> it is _not_ the base class... it is just a similar struct: http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/kv_engine/daemon/cookie.h#49 

What I mean by promote the cookie interface is that we could make the Cookie class visible to the rest of the world instead..

I'd rather leave that for later on, given how close we are to Beta etc. One for master once we branch.

Line:47, tracing/trace_helpers.h -> that's what's make me scared.. if then someone just change one of the definitions without knowing about the other it'll just crash...

I asked in the original reviews that we would just use the Cookie (without introducing any inheritance as all of the cookies would have this field and it would probably be better and easier to test in the future if we could use real cookies all over the place...)
