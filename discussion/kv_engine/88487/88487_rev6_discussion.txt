DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: Add Eviction Data Structure to Hash Table

The new algortihm for selecting which documents to evict from the hash
table use a hdr_histogram structure and corresponding percentage value.
These are provided in a new "Eviction" class, which is defined within
the HashTable class.

The Eviction class is added as a member of the HashTable class.  Also
the Eviction class is added as a parameter to the visit method of the
HashTableVisitor interface.

Line:888, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> I'm not sure this is the correct place for this :-

* It forces all visitors to be updated (and to have the complexity of it).
* It's (likely?) constant for all calls for a given visitation; so passing it as a variable into visit() is inefficient.

Suggest instead that you add it to the constructor of the specific subclass(es) which actually care about it.
