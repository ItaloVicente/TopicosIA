DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: Add Eviction Data Structure to Hash Table

The new algortihm for selecting which documents to evict from the hash
table use a hdr_histogram structure and corresponding percentage value.
These are provided in a new "Eviction" class, which is used by the
PagingVisitor class.

Line:36, engines/ep/src/eviction.cc -> Do we perhaps want to log here if we try set to a value above 100? Furthermore, is it fine to not set a value if this is the case or should we cap it to 100?

Line:36, engines/ep/src/eviction.cc -> ... suggest throwing std::invalid_argument

Line:44, engines/ep/src/eviction.cc -> I suggest you performing the biasing (0 -> 1, 1->2, ..., 255 -> 256) in the implementation of this method, then users don't need to care about the HDR histogram impl details (and you can simply make this function take a uint8_t).

Line:59, engines/ep/src/eviction.cc -> Given this is the only place you actually use percentage, I think it would be simpler if you removed the `percentage` member variable and get/set methods from here; and instead have the caller simply provide it as an argument to this method - I expect you'l be using exactly the same percentage for all vBuckets - so you can simply read it from the configuration.

Line:26, engines/ep/src/eviction.h -> Helpful to describe the algorithm used here.

Line:42, engines/ep/src/eviction.h -> The commit / function name aren't very descriptive here - the comment provides little more information than the function name. 

Percentage of what? Threshold of what?

Line:44, engines/ep/src/eviction.h -> Ditto.

Line:48, engines/ep/src/eviction.h -> I think this clause is somewhat of an implementation-detail - I expect that the histogram should be constructed with minimum and max values which that any uint16_t value can be stored?

Edit: Read the comment on min/maxFreqValue - given it's only valid to store from 0..255; why don't you just change the type this takes to uint8_t?

Line:68, engines/ep/src/eviction.h -> Nit: Given this is a type it should start with a capital (see https://github.com/couchbase/memcached/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#name-types-functions-variables-and-enumerators-properly)

Line:71, engines/ep/src/eviction.h -> Ok, this is more like it! (see above comment). Useful to give a similar comment in the interface (methods above) so the reader knows how to use it.

Line:38, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> You shouldn't need hdr_histogram here, given you don't directly reference it. eviction.h (where hdr_histogram is used) should already be including it.

Line:288, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> As per our conversation offline; I think much of this should actually be moved into the EvictionPager class; as its lifetime (e.g. hdr_histogram) is associated with the pager; not the vBucket itself.

File Comment: engines/ep/tests/module_tests/eviction_class_test.cc -> Nit: This should be named <FILE>_test.cc where <FILE> is the name of file which this tests - you don't need `class_` in the name.
Line:45, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/eviction_class_test.cc -> This is a bit of an implicit / stateful test - given you test these percentages in order, are you expecting that a value over 100 is simply ignored; or that we saturate at 100%?

Line:36, engines/ep/src/eviction.cc -> Removed the percentage attribute - as suggested in comment below.

Line:44, engines/ep/src/eviction.cc -> done

Line:59, engines/ep/src/eviction.cc -> done

Line:26, engines/ep/src/eviction.h -> done

Line:42, engines/ep/src/eviction.h -> removed attribute - so function removed.

Line:44, engines/ep/src/eviction.h -> removed attribute - so function removed.

Line:48, engines/ep/src/eviction.h -> changed to uint8_t  - as suggested.  And simplified comment.

Line:68, engines/ep/src/eviction.h -> sorry - forgot.  changed.

Line:71, engines/ep/src/eviction.h -> Removed attribute - as suggested in other comment.

Line:38, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> removed

Line:288, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> Is a member of PagingVisitor.

File Comment: engines/ep/tests/module_tests/eviction_class_test.cc -> changed to eviction_test.cc
Line:45, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/eviction_class_test.cc -> No longer have percentage attribute - so removing test.
