DESCRIPTION:

MB-32669: Set datatype when reading an evicted value on expiry

The expiry path needs the value for xattr docs (deleted or not)
so issues a read to kvstore. If the hash-table metadata.datatype
was set to snappy by the active compressor the value passed to
the expiry hook has incorrect datatype and triggers a crash.
