DESCRIPTION:

MB-29822: Log when closing a connection for unexpected errors

Except for when a connection is closed after a clean shutdown (i.e.,
connection closed by peer), we always want to log the reason why a
connection is being disconnected. It is very useful for debugging /
diagnostic.

Line:425, daemon/connection.h -> should we not use a reference?

Line:939, daemon/memcached.cc -> is this not normal behaviour - and hence should not be a WARNING?

Line:35, daemon/protocol/mcbp/cluster_config_executor.cc -> Don't think these should be warning? ( maybe NOTICE) - as they are not necessary a logic error

It would be better if we wrapped the DCP code the same way we have wrappers in engine_wrapper.h and perform the logging there if the engine returned disconnect. That way we'll have a single module where we deal with the error mapping.

With the current implementation we'll end up logging the same disconnect multiple times, and I'm not a super-fan of having the "reason" default argument there which is only used iff we're doing close (and with a default parameter we won't have a failure if a reason wasn't provided, so we'll soon end up in the situation where we enter the close state and didn't provide a reason).
Line:1402, daemon/connection.cc -> We've already performed logging above

Line:150, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> already logged

Line:1000, daemon/subdocument.cc -> From looking at the code it looks like it is remapErrorCode which may cause this to be engine disconnect which will return in logging the same info twice.

Not all the missing logs are on DCP command execution. So we still have to manage all the other cases.

> With the current implementation we'll end up logging the same disconnect multiple times, and I'm not a super-fan of having the "reason" default argument there which is only used iff we're doing close (and with a default parameter we won't have a failure if a reason wasn't provided, so we'll soon end up in the situation where we enter the close state and didn't provide a reason).

This was an attempt (far from being optimum) to manage the logging of closing connection in a single function (I decided for Connection::setState).

Do we just prefer to:
1) wrap the DCP calls into engine_wrapper.h
2) manually log before calling Connection::setState(closing) (as we already do) in the missing places
?
Line:1402, daemon/connection.cc -> Done

Line:425, daemon/connection.h -> enum class is a integral type underneath, it should be ok to pass is by value, isn't it?

Line:939, daemon/memcached.cc -> I considered to upgrade to Warning every disconnection not caused by a clean shutdown by the peer, so that we can have a clear understanding of the disconnection even if the minimum log level is Warning.
Is that too aggressive?

Line:35, daemon/protocol/mcbp/cluster_config_executor.cc -> Same as the other comment, I considered to upgrade all the disconnection to Warning, so that we have the message even if the log-level is > Info.

That is what we do for the other calls interfacing the engine, so by doing it for these functions as well we'll keep that consistent.

I think that's the best solution. Given that this is state just like all of the other states we've got it's hard to enforce logging the shutdown / disconnect case.
