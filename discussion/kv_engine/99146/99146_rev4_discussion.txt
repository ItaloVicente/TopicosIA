DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Move PagingVisitor to separate file

The PagingVisitor class requires significant refactoring to cleanly
separate out the hifi_mfu policy from the original lru2bit policy.  The
first step in this refactor is to separate out the PagingVisitor class
into it own file. A separate paging_visitor.h file already exists.
