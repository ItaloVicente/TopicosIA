DESCRIPTION:

Cleanup: Remove the use of useConnectionSendResponse

It was added as an optimization for SSL to make sure that
we could fit more data into the same TLS frame. Now that
we're using bufferevent we're already copying the data
into libevents send buffer anyway so this optimization
isn't needed anymore)
