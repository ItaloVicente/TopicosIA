DESCRIPTION:

MB-53042: Aggregate stats for multiple buckets

Adds a new GlobalTask called CrossBucketStatsAggregator which can be run
periodically to update the stats we care about for the quota sharing
group. I will use this task to update the memory condition checks such
that they consider the pooled watermarks and memory usage of all engines
sharing quota.

Line:89, engines/ep/src/cross_bucket_stats_aggregator.h -> Is this method used with any other engine type? Or is it templated over E for other reasons e.g., to avoid a vector over an incomplete type somewhere/including ep-engine

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> My immediate question from looking at the names is that this should be located in the core and not in the bucket itself? I would have expected everything which is supposed to be "across multiple buckets" to be in the core, and then call down into the various engines...

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> While that would be ideal, I'm not sure how we could achieve it without exposing details about ep-engine's internals. 

This applies to other quota sharing related changes: frequency counters update and the item pager changes also are inherently ep-engine specific. Things like pageable memory watermarks and memory usage are things the core isn't currently aware of. 

Admittedly, stats aggregation requires less co-operation between engine instances, and so moving it to the core would be easier compared to those. We could hide the implementation details by aggregating over something like a std::map<std::string, std::any> or similar. What are your thoughts about that? 

Perhaps the naming could be changed. This is really aggregating stats over an EPEngineGroup.
Line:89, engines/ep/src/cross_bucket_stats_aggregator.h -> It is only called with std::vector<EPEngineGroup::Handle>, but I wanted to avoid #include "ep_engine_group.h".

I haven't made it a free function in the source file, because CachedStat<T> is private to CrossBucketStatsAggregator.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> My main reservation for doing this is that we would have to sum the std::map<key, std::any> and expose it back to ep-engine, possibly via the ServerApi, then read back the stats from the map, casting to the correct integer type. We will also have to add some way for the core to check whether the engine is sharing quota, so we know which "special" buckets to do this for. This seems somewhat invasive, brittle and more complicated to test. 

Note that there is no raciness with bucket stats here, because we are going through EPEngineGroup, which uses tryAssociateBucket.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Indeed, that is what it could look like from the core's perspective. We would have to introduce some concept of bucket groups and a way for buckets to declare which group they want to be a part of. 

We might not be able to use nlohmann::json, as we will also want to aggregate MFU histograms for MB-52682, which is why I mentioned std::any.

I will see if I can come up with something reasonable.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> ehh:

core:

    nlohmann::json json;
    buckets::forEach([&json](auto& bucket)) {
        bucket.getEngine().aggregateStats(bucket.getGroupName(), json);
    }

    for (auto[k,v] : json) {
       addStats(key, value);
    }    
   
 engine would then either ignore the call (and do nothing), or do a += on the value it wants to aggregate.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> the core could call down into each engine something like what you suggest and it would be up to each engine type to figure out what it what it would use. It would deal with all raciness related to buckets changing states while you're doing this as the core would only call the aggregation for buckets in "ready" state.
