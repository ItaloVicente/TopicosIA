DESCRIPTION:

MB-36486: Consume all items when rolling back unpersisted items

Currently when we rollback unpersisted items we do not consider
Checkpoints of different type. This is important as
getNextItemsForPersistence will only return items from contiguous
Checkpoints of the same type. This would cause us to fail to rollback
the HashTable state of some items.

Call getNextItemsForPersistence until no more items are available
when rolling back unpersisted items.
