DESCRIPTION:

MB-28047: Change the update interval to be percent of items in ht

The update of the frequency counter threshold is currently performed
every time 100 items have been visited in the hash table.

This is changed to be a percentage of the number of items in the hash
table.  It is currently set at 10%.  Therefore the threshold will be
updated after visiting 10%, 20%, 30% etc. of items in the hash table.
