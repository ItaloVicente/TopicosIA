DESCRIPTION:

MB-54272: Don't parse audit_events.json at runtime

We don't support modifying this file at the customer site
so we can simplify the logic by generate code at build
time

This is an initial refactor for a followup refactor where
we'll add support for a more fine grained audit configuration.
