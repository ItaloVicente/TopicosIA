DESCRIPTION:

MB-29481: Add CheckpointRemoverTest class and test cases

Add implentation for the CheckpointRemoverTest class, which builds on
top of the SingleThreadedKVBucketTest class.

Add the following test cases:
  - vBucketMap: Test correct ordering of getActiveVBucketsSortedByChkMgrMem
  - CheckpointManager: Check correct memory usage calculation
  - CheckpointManager: Test cursor dropping eligibility is correct
  - CheckpointManager: Test cursor dropping expected/actual freed memory

Change-Id: I85b2e9b68c85e2c3d9245d75dd4cb947bfe678a7

In terms of additional tests - think about what could fail; and how failures are handled. For example, what happens if handleSlowStream returns false (because cursor dropping isn't supported)? There may be other functions here with error paths which need testing...
Line:281, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> Ordering: "remover" < "test"

Line:27, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> Nit: test names should be Capitalised.

Line:47, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> If they should be greater, prefer ASSERT_GT

Line:51, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> We've named these "MockXXX" in other instances.

Line:71, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> Prefer to name public_checkpointList() (same as other methods on fakes).

Line:74, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> I normally include a brief (1-2 sentence overview of each test so the reader can orientate themselves on what the test is doing).

Line:78, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> Prefer dynamic_cast - reinterpret_cast is basically like a C cast - it performs no runtime checks.

Line:81, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> The arguments to this are backwards - first argument is expected value, second is actual (here and elsewhere).

Line:88, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> I'm not sure this is a particulary useful test - you're basically doing exactly the same thing that getMemoryUsage does internally. As such, a bug in getMemConsumption() wouldn't be detected.

I suggest instead you calculate from first principles how much memory should be used (i.e. explicitly record and sum up the sizes of each item in the checkpoint when they are added to it), and compare that to what getMemoryUsage returns.

Line:116, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> Style: `auto cursors` is simpler.

Line:118, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> backwards arguments

Line:148, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> Style: given this is quite a long expression (and you've got the same at line 129), I'd assign this to a const variable. It also improves the readibility of the code as you can name it based on what it represents in this context (number of dirty items in vBucket).

Line:186, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> Style: You reference vb->checkpointManager a number of times. For brevity consider assigning to a (shorter named) reference.

Line:208, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> Again, same as code in previous test - move to a helper function.

Line:26, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.h -> You shouldn't need this header - looks unused.
