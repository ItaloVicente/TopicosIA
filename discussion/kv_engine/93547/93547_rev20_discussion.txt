MB-29481: Add CheckpointRemoverTest class and test cases

top of the SingleThreadedKVBucketTest class.

Add the following test cases:
  - vBucketMap: Test correct ordering of getActiveVBucketsSortedByChkMgrMem
  - CheckpointManager: Check correct memory usage calculation
  - CheckpointManager: Test cursor dropping eligibility is correct
  - CheckpointManager: Test cursor dropping expected/actual freed memory
