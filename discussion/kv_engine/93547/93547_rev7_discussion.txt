DESCRIPTION:

MB-29481: Add CheckpointRemoverTest class

This class extends the basic CheckpointTest class to also
initialise a mock server instance. This is needed for certain
tests which will require access to the KVBucket object or
VBucketMap objects, which the current CheckpointTest class
does not have the scope for.
