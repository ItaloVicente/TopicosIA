DESCRIPTION:

MB-47318: Account for packet data when received, but ACK on success

MB-47318 and the test code in this patch demonstrated that a buffered
delete can lead to an incorrect DCP buffer-acknowledgement, larger
than sent from the producer (MB-47318) or smaller (as found by extended
testing).

The issue occurs because as we process a DCP delete it may need the
value sanitising to handle past bugs - this means decompressing the
Item for inspection. If we then fail to store the delete and have to
buffer the Item, the AUXIO task when successful in storing the delete
will calculate the ACK based on the sanitised/decompressed Item -
this is now larger or smaller than the packet data.

The fix in this commit is to always account for the ACK size on the
'front-end' function - i.e. DcpConsumer:deletion using the
UpdateFlowControl object. This code is looking at the 'raw' network
data and can calculate the correct size. However UpdateFlowControl is
changed so that it will only ever trigger a buffer acknowledgement
when data is successfully stored. If data is buffered, the
notification to acknowledge is skipped. Now when the AUXIO buffering
task successfully stores the buffered items it can now trigger an
acknowledgement.

Line:1239, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Interesting, the call was already there before your change - does that mean that we were double-acking? Ie, once in the fe-thread and a second time here ?

Line:1244, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Mmmm so "all processed" && "more items to process" ? That seems semantically inconsistent 😕.. is that possible? What's the semantic here?

Line:548, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> Does this RAII thing really make sense at this point?
It feels like UpdateFlowControl is adding useless complexity rather than simplify things, I mean the pattern is:

- declare/init 'UpdateFlowControl ufl(notify=true, bytes)'
- execute our code
- if buffered, then ufl.skipNotify()
- if buffered, notify manually

That was the same before your change already, but now we need to add the extra complexity of 'bool notify'. Why not just entirely removing the UpdateFlowControl struct and:

- iff main path success, then manually notify
- iff buffered path success, then manually notify

?

Please check my responses - i'm not seeing anything to change
Line:1239, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> no as the handleFlowCtl code will only send what it needs to ack for, if it's called twice the second one will do nothing unless we buit up enough outstanding bytes

Line:1244, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> I've not changed the code around all_processed - just that rather than bytes remaining we now return items. If you look at the existing code it looks like all_processed can be returned when the batch limit is hit, so that we do a notify before resuming the loop - i'm sure there's room for improvement on how this loop and processBufferedMessages interact but not sure it's part of this commit

Line:548, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> all the failure paths still need to account so the RAII pattern here is useful, otherwise every existing and new exit path from those functions needs to consider what todo

got it, thanks for clarifying

Line:548, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> Ack

Line:1239, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> oh forgot that we are flowing in that handleFlowCtl() func here 👍
