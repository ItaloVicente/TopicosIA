DESCRIPTION:

MB-47318: Account for packet data when received, but ACK on success

MB-47318 and the test code in this patch demonstrated that a buffered
delete can lead to an incorrect DCP buffer-acknowledgement, larger
than sent from the producer (MB-47318) or smaller (as found by extended
testing).

The issue occurs because as we process a DCP delete it may need the
value sanitising to handle past bugs - this means decompressing the
Item for inspection. If we then fail to store the delete and have to
buffer the Item, the AUXIO task when successful in storing the delete
will calculate the ACK based on the sanitised/decompressed Item -
this is now larger or smaller than the packet data.

The fix in this commit is to always account for the ACK size on the
'front-end' function - i.e. DcpConsumer:deletion using the
UpdateFlowControl object. This code is looking at the 'raw' network
data and can calculate the correct size. However UpdateFlowControl is
changed so that it will only ever trigger a buffer acknowledgement
when data is successfully stored. If data is buffered, the
notification to acknowledge is skipped. Now when the AUXIO buffering
task successfully stores the buffered items it can now trigger an
acknowledgement.

Line:35, tests/testapp/testapp_dcp_consumer.cc -> You can use adminConnection for this as the get[Admin]Connection calls will create a new connection (the userConnection/adminConnection is used by a lot of the utility functions in the test framework to avoid creating new connections)

If you want a new connection for each test-case I'd prefer if you did something like:

    conn = userConnection->clone();
    conn->authenticate("@admin", mcd_env->getPassword("@admin));
    conn->selectBucket(bucketName);

Line:35, tests/testapp/testapp_dcp_consumer.cc -> hey - i certainly want one connection for the whole test, as it is associated with the DCP consumer created n SetUp - your first suggestion will be the one!

Line:35, tests/testapp/testapp_dcp_consumer.cc -> Each test will need a new connection, when we create the consumer it marks that connection as DCP, stopping any other tests doing things like selectBucket ... second suggestion it is 

I could look at doing it for SetUpTestCase as I don't think I need to create/destroy consumer constantly

Line:35, tests/testapp/testapp_dcp_consumer.cc -> (it is null because you inherrited from TestappTest and not the TestappClientTest (if my memory is correct))

Line:35, tests/testapp/testapp_dcp_consumer.cc -> Uploaded with no real change here - userConnection was null when I tried as suggested

SetupTestCase idea is tricky as I can't access much of use from the static function

Line:35, tests/testapp/testapp_dcp_consumer.cc -> TestappClientTest already defines the test parameters via ::testing::WithParamInterface which i need for this fixture
