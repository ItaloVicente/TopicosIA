DESCRIPTION:

MB-39620: Improve validation of TLS configuration

Add validation of TLS configuration messages (and unit
tests for them).

The change unfortunately had to disable some of the
validation in old settings path for TLS minimum version
as the naming change, but given that the value is
currently only set from ns_server (which will migrate
over to the new way this isn't seen as a huge problem)
