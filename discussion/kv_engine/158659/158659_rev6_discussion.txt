DESCRIPTION:

MB-47714: Add configuration support for magma Group Commit

magma_enable_group_commit

Group Commit allows transactions in magma to be grouped together
to reduce the number of WAL fsyncs. When a transaction is ready
to fsync, if there are new transactions waiting to start, we
stall the transaction waiting to fsync until there are no more
transactions waiting to start for a given magma instance or for 1
of the conditions below.

magma_group_commit_max_sync_wait_duration

When magma group commit is enabled,
magma_group_commit_max_sync_wait_duration can be used to limit
the amount of time stalled transactions wait before the WAL
fsync proceeds.  If the longest transaction waiting has waited
magma_group_commit_max_sync_wait_duration ms or more, the current
transaction will trigger the WAL fsync regardless if there are
pending transactions waiting to start. This makes sure slower
devices don't stall transactions too long.

magma_group_commit_max_transaction_count

When magma group commit is enabled,
magma_group_commit_max_transaction_count can be used to limit the
amount of time stalled transactions wait before the WAL fsync
proceeds.  If the number of transactions stalled + the current
transaction is >= magma_group_commit_max_transaction_count, the
current transaction will trigger the WAL fsync regardless if there
are pending transactions waiting to start. This makes sure faster
devices don't have a significant increase in latency.
