DESCRIPTION:

MB-37096: Debug CRT: Don't reset bytesAllocated on MemTrackingAlloc move

When move-assigning or move-constructing MemoryTrackingAllocator, don't
move the underlying bytesAllocated shared_ptr.

This is necessary because the move ctor can be invoked when the
underlying container is moved; however the old (moved-from)
container while _logically_ empty could still _physically_ own
allocations (e.g. a sentinal node in a std::list). As such, we need
to ensure the moved-from container's allocator (i.e. other) can
still perform deallocations, hence bytesAllocated should only be
copied, not moved-from.
