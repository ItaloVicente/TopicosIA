DESCRIPTION:

MB-36557: Avoid lock-inversion at set-vbstate and conn-disconnect

With MB-36372 we always acquire an exclusive lock to vbstate at
vbstate-change. Also, down in the call hierarchy we acquire the
connLock.
But, in the code executed by EPE::handleDisconnect we acquire the
two locks in opposite order.
TSAN spots the issue as soon as the two code paths are executed in
parallel, which is achieved by the test added with this pacth.
To fix, with this patch we release the connLock at EPE::handleDisconnect
before we acquire the vbstateLock.

Currently when we call DcpConsumer::setDisconnect we call scheduleNotify(). If we skip this notification could we end with a DcpConsumer connection getting stuck and not processed?

Good question, actually yes. So, we don't push any message to the readyQ at PassiveStream::setDead (so no notification necessary for that) but we do push a StreamEnd message to the readyQ at ActiveStream::setDead. So scheduleNotify() cannot be skipped for a DcpConsumer (given that it may process ActiveStreams). Fixing.

Correcting myself here, sorry for generating confusion. The above is FALSE. We can have DcpProducer on Replica VBucket, but we can't have ActiveStream for DcpConsumer.
