DESCRIPTION:

MB-36557: Avoid lock-inversion at set-vbstate and conn-disconnect

With MB-36372 we always acquire an exclusive lock to vbstate at
vbstate-change. Also, down in the call hierarchy we acquire the
connLock.
But, in the code executed by EPE::handleDisconnect we acquire the
two locks in opposite order.
TSAN spots the issue as soon as the two code paths are executed in
parallel, which is achieved by the test added with this patch.
To fix, with this patch we release the connLock at EPE::handleDisconnect
before we acquire the vbstateLock.

Note: this issue blocked the test for MB-36637, test enabled here.

LGTM, could just simplify the test slightly
Line:2188, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> which is what

Line:2226, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> If you don't pass the cookie into setVBucketState then this is not necessary
