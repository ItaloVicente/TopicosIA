DESCRIPTION:

MB-27197 CouchRocks: Update VBState without reading high seqno from disk

When we commit a batch of mutations, we do not need to read the highest
persisted seqno from disk to check that it is correct, as that is ensured
by rocksdb::DB::Write() executing successfully.
So, we can just update the VBucket state with the highest value that we
find in the commit batch.
