DESCRIPTION:

MB-37658: Order readyQueue tasks by priority and wakeTime

Currently we order tasks in the readyQueue by uid. This means that
tasks of the same priority are re-ordered based on the time that they
were created. This causes a large variation (and high tail latencies)
in schedule times for the same tasks. Instead, order tasks in the
readyQueue by wakeTime if they are of the same priorty. This should
ensure that they maintain the futureQueue ordering when moved to the
readyQueue (if they are the same priority).

For the test Pillowfight, 20/80 R/W, 256B binary items this reduced
tail latencies of storage_age (time from queueing a document to the
flusher visiting it) and Flusher schedule times. Histograms for
storage_age:
Before: P50    - 1900ms - 3276ms
        P90    - 12582ms - 13107ms
        P99    - 23068ms - 24117ms
        P99.9  - 33554ms - 35651ms
        P99.99 - 41943ms - 44040ms
        
After:  P50    - 2031ms - 3276ms
        P90    - 11534ms - 12582ms
        P99    - 20971ms - 22020ms
        P99.9  - 25165ms - 26214ms
        P99.99 - 27262ms - 28311ms

Histograms for Flusher schedule times:
Before: P50    - 12ms -   14ms
        P90    - 73ms -  110ms
        P99    - 753ms -  786ms
        P99.9  - 1310ms - 1376ms
        P99.99 - 2228ms - 2359ms

After:  P50    - 13ms -   15ms
        P90    - 147ms -  196ms
        P99    - 720ms -  786ms
        P99.9  - 1310ms - 1376ms
        P99.99 - 1638ms - 1703ms

For the test Avg Throughput (ops/sec), SDK 3, Durability Persist Majority, 4 nodes, Workload A, 6 Clients
this improved performance from 6,557 ops/s to 6,857 ops/s.
