DESCRIPTION:

MB-29369: Re-enable cursor dropping

This is a partial revert of 56861598 with some added changes for
vulcan.

Cursor dropping is now enabled however:

1) A vulcan DCP Producer accepts two control message keys
  * supports_cursor_dropping_vulcan
  * supports_cursor_dropping

2) The vulcan DCP Consumer only sends supports_cursor_dropping_vulcan

With these changes an external client can still change cursor dropping
with the existing supports_cursor_dropping key, yet replication will
only enable cursor dropping for vulcan to vulcan (or any version after
vulcan).
