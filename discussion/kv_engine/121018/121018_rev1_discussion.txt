DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Remove local 'moreAvailable' var in EPBucket::flushVBucket

I am going to touch code in EPBucket::flushVBucket for removing the
usage of the rejectQueue and I want to simplify the function a bit
before proceeding.
I proceed by tiny steps (like here) if possible as the code is quite
complex.
