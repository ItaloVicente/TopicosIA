DESCRIPTION:

MB-53979: Ensure Gauge/Counter metrics expose correct value

When support for Gauges/Counters was added, it was overlooked that
PrometheusStatCollector only set the untyped value in
prometheus::ClientMetric, so gauges/counters exposed the default value
of zero.

Change-Id: I62fe137e2eba2b17c8ea4840699deb00f0ba082c
