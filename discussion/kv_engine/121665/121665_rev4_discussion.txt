DESCRIPTION:

MB-36379: Add cb::Env to store runtime environment parameters

We need to know how many file descriptors so that we can pass a subset
to the engine. Currently this is only accessible in memcached.cc so
add cb::Env so that we can add this to the server core API later.

Line:30, daemon/env.h -> I'd prefer Environment

Line:43, daemon/memcached.h -> please don't bloat this file, the extern could be in environment.h instead as people who wants to use it needs to include it anyway.
