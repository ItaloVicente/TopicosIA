DESCRIPTION:

MB-48506: Use 'queueMemOverhead' for overhead tracking in Checkpoint

That removes the need of any user-defined allocator for tracking the
memory consumption of Checkpoint::toWrite. Which prevents us from doing
fancy things at ItemExpel for keeping the allocator bytes-accointing
correct at splice(range).
