DESCRIPTION:

MB-44919: Own BFM in backfills pending queue

When we destory a BFM we may leave invalid references to it
in the pending queue of the DcpConnMap. Change the reference
to a shared_ptr to ensure the validity of it.

Line:249, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.h -> I don't think this should be a shared_ptr; I think that complicates the lifetime of these objects and makes it confusing to see what owns what.

A weak_ptr is probably the better option if we need some level of ownership here, but even that I think is probably complicating ownership model more than necessary - and we probably want to either periodically check this set, or change the construction of BackfillManager objects to not use make_shared (so control block and object are allocated separately and hence object can be freed when shared refcount hits 0.

However perhaps we can revisit the original design of the change for MB-4456 (http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/147424) with these new facts in mind and see if we can find a better implementation?

Line:249, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.h -> weak_ptr was the first thought, but doesn't work as it can't be the type used in the set (no comparator/hash) and can't be used in the queue as we can't remove whatever the set points to as we can't use the weak_ptr if it's already been destroyed. 

I'll see what else I can come up with though

Line:249, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.h -> Didn't come up with other solutions but I've changed this to remove the shared_ptr and call in from the dtor to remove the references to the BFM. Changed the set to a map and the queue to a deque so shouldn't be O(n) removal.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:249, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.h -> Changing the snoozing logic for the no backfill resource case is simple enough but we snooze for a bunch of other reasons that aren't as easy to make event driven. Examples include ongoing range reads, not having persisted the requested seqno, and memory being over a watermark. The pending backfill case would be simple to fix but would add additional complexity without addressing the others too which feels more like a post-Cheshire-Cat type change.

Line:249, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.h -> Changing the snooze seems reasonable to me, event driven would definitely be better. That feels to me more like something we could build on top of this though rather than do first as it feels as though we'll need some similar unique queue of BackfillManagers. I'll poke around with the snooze and see

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:249, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.h -> Thinking about this problem more, I think the underlying issue is how BackfillManagerTasks are managed, specifically when they are told to snooze.

The 1s snooze time (see BackfillManagerTask::run()) is totally arbitrary, and if there's actually >4096 tasks scheduled but unable to run due to limit, that's the larger issue here.

I think we should look at the larger problem here which I think is the scheduling of large numbers of BackfillManagerTasks - we really should have an event-driven setup where the snooze() above when there's no work do do immediately should be INT_MAX, and then we wake up the "correct" task as and when it's ready.

To put slightly differently, I think we should kill the 1s snooze, then figure out a way to make this all work where we explicitly wake up the next snoozing BackfillManagerTask when capacity becomes available in terms of maxRunning backfills.

I don't know the exact solution here, but at the moment comparing the code before the fix for MB-44562 to now, it feels a lot more complex and I'm not sure we've bought much in the common case where there's a reasonable number of Backfills in flight...
