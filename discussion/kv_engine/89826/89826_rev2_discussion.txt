DESCRIPTION:

Remove remnants of SQLite WAL tests

These 'MULTI_DISPATCHER_CONFIG' tests appear to date to before
couchstore; and are additonal variants on existing tests (note the
'(wal)' suffix).

Given this configuration is long dead, remove these tests as they are
essentially just duplicates of the non-wal suffixed ones.
