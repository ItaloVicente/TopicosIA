DESCRIPTION:

MB-52668 Release Magma SeqIterator when scan is yielded

> Problem
A seeked SeqIterator has considerable memory consumption depending on
the item size. During DCP disk backills, kv-engine opens and seeks many
such iterators and round robins across them. The aggregate memory
consumption can be very large and cause all backfills to *permanently
snooze* upon hitting the backfill_mem_threshold. This results in a
forever stuck state.

> Source of memory consumption
Magma's SeqIterator internally creates an iterator per level of the LSM
Tree. Every such iterator holds 2 index blocks (fixed size 4KB) and 1
data block. The size of the data block is 4KB for all levels except the
data level (last level) whose size depends on the item size.

Assuming a typical 5 level tree, memory consumption is:
* For item sizes <= 4KB 5*12KB=60KB.
* If item size > 4KB, for example 5MB, 4*12KB + (8KB+5MB) = 5.056MB.

Depending on num_running_backills, this scales up a lot. For example
with 48 backfills on a 256MB bucket quota, memory consumption is 242MB.

> Solution
When deciding to yield an iterator and move on to the next one, destroy
the iterator. Upon a resume, construct a new iterator starting from the
lastReadSeqno. This brings down memory consumption significantly. In the
previous 5MB item size example, memory consumption is only 5MB.
