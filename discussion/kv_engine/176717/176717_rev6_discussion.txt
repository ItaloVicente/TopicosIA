DESCRIPTION:

MB-52668 Release Magma SeqIterator when scan is yielded

> Problem
A seeked SeqIterator has considerable memory consumption depending on
the item size. During DCP disk backills, kv-engine opens and seeks many
such iterators and round robins across them. The aggregate memory
consumption can be very large and cause all backfills to *permanently
snooze* upon hitting the backfill_mem_threshold. This results in a
forever stuck state.

> Source of memory consumption
Magma's SeqIterator internally creates an iterator per level of the LSM
Tree. Every such iterator holds 2 index blocks (fixed size 4KB) and 1
data block. The size of the data block is 4KB for all levels except the
data level (last level) whose size depends on the item size.

Assuming a typical 5 level tree, memory consumption is:
* For item sizes <= 4KB 5*12KB=60KB.
* If item size > 4KB, for example 5MB, 4*12KB + (8KB+5MB) = 5.056MB.

Depending on num_running_backills, this scales up a lot. For example
with 48 backfills on a 256MB bucket quota, memory consumption is 242MB.

> Solution
When deciding to yield an iterator and move on to the next one, destroy
the iterator. Upon a resume, construct a new iterator starting from the
lastReadSeqno. This brings down memory consumption significantly as only
one iterator is kept alive. In the previous 5MB item size example,
memory consumption is only 5MB.

In theory doing this frequently will cause reseeks which will incur
extra read I/Os to re-read the index, data blocks for all levels.
However this is not as severe for two reasons:
* reads could be served from Linux page cache due to temporal locality.
* reseeks happen even now if the iterator internally moved to a seqno >
startSeqno provided.

> Regression testing
Ran these tests under the HiDD showfast tab and did not observe any
significant regression:
* DCP tput
* 250M rebalance out
* 1B rebalance out
* XDCR 2->2

> Implementation note
As we now frequently construct/destruct SeqIterator, the logs in its
constructor/destructor indicating start/end of the backfill have been
made to log on debug level. Start/end of the backfill and other details
can anyways be figured out from kv-engine's log messages by grepping for
"MagmaKVStore::initBySeqnoScanContext", "Backfill complete"
respectively.

The only detail now missing is number of times a SeqIterator was
reseeked. As this corresponds to a scan pausing/resuming, in a follow up
patch we will add a yieldCount field to the scan context itself and log
it when backfill completes.
