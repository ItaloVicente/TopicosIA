DESCRIPTION:

MB-47462: Ensure a single CheckpointVisitor is created

The introduction of eager checkpoint removal allowed
ClosedUnrefCheckpointRemoverTask to skip visiting every vbucket to find
unreferenced checkpoints.

Concurrent changes made CheckpointVisitor also responsible for cursor
dropping, and the guard preventing construction of multiple
CheckpointVisitors was lost in a rebase.

As a result, multiple CheckpointVisitors could be constructed by
repeated runs of ClosedUnrefCheckpointRemoverTask.

This patch makes CheckpointVisitor aware of whether to look for closed
unreferenced checkpoints, and allows ClosedUnrefCheckpointRemoverTask
to correctly guard CheckpointVisitor creation even when eager
checkpoint removal is configured.
