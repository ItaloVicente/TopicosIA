DESCRIPTION:

MB-27955: Enabling HELLO::Snappy on DCP connections should stream snappy
          documents

When HELLO::Snappy is enabled on the DCP Producer, DCP should be able
to stream items of datatype SNAPPY. Right now, value compression is
only enabled on the producer if force_value_compression control
message is passed to the DCP Producer

Now it sends compressed data regardless the HELLO flags.

This dump contains session where I do not send snappy HELLO flag, but the server still pushes it in compressed form.

Line:158, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> I don't believe this is correct - ActiveStream::isCompressionEnabled() is used in ActiveStream::makeResponseFromItem() to determine if we compress the new item. 

By just changing this to return true; we as essentially *always* compressing Values.

I believe the behaviour should be:

# If Snappy not supported; send raw values as raw; decompress snappy values.
# If Snappy is supported, but forceValueCompression==false; send values as is (raw as raw; snappy as snappy).
# If Snappy is supported, and forceValueCompression==true; compress raw; send snappy as is.

Line:160, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> I can't see this new method used anywhere apart from tests. Can remove it from the public API - move it to MockDcpProducer?

Line:158, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> Maybe I am missing something something here. This returns true only if force ValueCompression is explicitly enabled. If not, we check if snappy has been explicitly enabled on the connection. Else, we return false so that the caller can decompress.

Line:158, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> check for 

  forceCompression = true
  snappySupported = false

It should be always sending raw values, and actively decompressing.

forceValueCompression = true and snappySupported = false is not possible. When the control message "force_value_compression" is received on the producer, we check if snappySupported is true and only then enable forceValueCompression.

but why we should send this control message? And actually in pcap file I've mentioned I'm not sending this control message. And yet the server pushes compressed data.

The topic of the change is about HELLO SNAPPY, not DCP control.

Patch Set 3:

In general will it cover the case, when the client sends HELLO{SNAPPY}, but does not send DCP control message for compression?

Why the client should send two different settings for the same feature? I though sending HELLO{SNAPPY} should be enough to enable compression. As well as not sending anything should not trigger any compression (but currently it does). 

How this change covers the case when the server already has compressed item, but the DCP client didn't notified that it wants compression? I expect that the server will actively decompress the item.

Negotiating for HELLO::Snappy will only ensure that the connection can receive snappy compressed documents, it won't do any forcible compression of its own. So, if a document is already compressed, it will be sent as compressed. If not, it will not. If a control message is also sent on top of HELLO::Snappy, there DCP must do forcible compression. So, if doc is uncompressed and HELLO::Snappy and force_value_compression are both enabled, DCP should compress the document and send it over the wire.

It includes two clients. cbc-cp with the compressed document, and also my dcp client, which does not enable SNAPPY compression on the streams.
