DESCRIPTION:

MB-41459: Set default magma flushers/compactors correctly

When storage threads configuration is not set, we need to set the
default number of storage threads to magma_max_default_storage_threads
rather than attempting to base the number of storage threads on the
number of writer threads. The default number of writer threads can have
a huge range from a default of 4 to when couchbase is optimized for io
where its set to the number of threads on the machine. Trying to set
storage threads based on number of writer threads probably doesn't make
sense.

When testing magma or for users on small systems using magma, setting
storage threads is the correct way to adjust the number of storage
threads. If not set, the default setting is still small enough that it
should work for almost all cases other than extremely small scenarios
where magma isn't really targeted.

In the general case I still think the number of magma threads needs to scale with the machine size - people will likely do functional testing of Magma on small machines (Docker containers on laptop, small VMs) etc and spinning up 20 threads each time - particulary if those threads are all doing work - will likely give them a poor experience with Magma. 

For example, we saw similar issues in MB-39618 when running on Docker on macOS, where 150% CPU was consumed for essentially a very small workload.

However, in the short-term I'm fine with you making this change, but this is still something which needs to be revisited for GA.
