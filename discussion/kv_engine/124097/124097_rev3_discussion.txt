Sorry the patch got updated mid-review, looks like the comments hold on patchset 3 though :)

Line:2020, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> could change to return true/false (true if item was queued). You may not need it in this patch but is kind of what i'd expect it to return.

Line:2026, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> this looks quite fragile, is there a better test? I also don't know why 2 :)

Line:2030, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> This test isn't right, the vb->getHighSeqno returns the current in-memory high-seqno of the vbucket, which is effectively 'ticking' up for every mutation, it is very likely that this test would frequently return true as the high-seqno is really in the future.

What you should compare with is the readyQ.front's SnapshotMarker's snapshot end.

Thus we send the SeqnoAdvanced every time we have a snapshot that falls short of what we've said the end is.

The same test applies to memory snapshots, in the case where the snapshot is short (because we dropped prepare/abort), so you could possibly infer everything from one test (for backfill and in-memory sync-write stuff).

Line:434, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> Is this from a clang-tidy patch? It seems unrelated and I would prefer it to be split out into a separate patch (same comment for the other initalisation changes below).

Line:554, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> nit: IfNeeded
