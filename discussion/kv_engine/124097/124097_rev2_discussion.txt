Line:451, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> two bools looks a bit opaque

Line:1218, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> This is starting to kinda overload the meaning of visibleSeqno "highest visible seqno if !isCollectionEnabledStream(), else highest seqno seen at all, possibly NOT visible".

Just worth bearing in mind that it will break the assumptions people will have when reading the snapshot(...) method when they see the "maxVisibleSeqno" parameter.

Line:2020, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Hmmm, might be easier to follow if this is kept with a positive sense (i.e., "lastItemVisible"). Avoids the mental "that variable is false, so the item is not not visible, so it's visible"

Line:2020, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> nit

Line:2027, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> not sure this is going to be safe - backfills don't hold the stream mutex from create() all the way to complete(), so the snapshot marker might have been sent, and removed from the ready queue.

Also, this doesn't check !readyQ.empty(), so readyQ.front()->... isn't safe.

Also also, out of interest, why `<= 2`? One for the marker, and what is number 2?

Line:2029, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Caveat: still rereading, might have missed something.

Is this safe to do? If this is being queued in completeBackfill(), the in-memory high seqno might be much higher than where the backfill should have ended - the high seqno is the seqno of the last item in the checkpoint manager. This looks like it would lead to the consumer seeing (for example)

 marker (disk) start:100, end:200
 ...
 SeqnoAdvanced seqno:250

 marker (memory) start:201, end:250
 ... // items from checkpoint manager

The backfill scan context has the seqno of the last item it will scan `scanCtx->maxSeqno`, so that might be a better value? If we finish the backfill but _don't_ send the item at that seqno then we could seqnoadvance to that seqno safely and we definitely won't go "backwards" from that seqno.

Line:554, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> nit visible

Line:1218, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> I don't like this ether was just a hack to get it working and am planning on making this more of an elegant solution.

Line:2027, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> interesting point about the state of the readyQ with backfill. I'll have an investigation into this.

Regarding the '!readQ.empty()' see line 2022. If the queue is empty we'll never hit this line. Thus .front() and .back() is safe.

Regarding <= this is wrong I believe, an empty collection backfill should always send two items one the snapshotmarker and two the SystemEvent for the given collection.

Line:2029, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> yes this is wrong and one of the amendments that need to be made :)

Line:2027, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Ahh didn't spot that :roger: So in that case, if the two items are quickly drained leaving an empty queue, this will silently not queue a SeqnoAdvanced?

Is this only necessary for an empty collection backfill? What about a backfill for a collection, but the disk scan ends on an item from a different collection? (Or is that already handled and I've missed it?)

It might be easier to work from the seqnos tracked by ActiveStream rather than inspecting the readyQ - the stream tracks lastReadSeqno and lastSentSnapEndSeqno, so one could do:

 if (isCollectionEnabledStream() && lastReadSeqno < lastSentSnapEndSeqno) {
     // send a SeqnoAdvanced to lastSentSnapEndSeqno
 }
