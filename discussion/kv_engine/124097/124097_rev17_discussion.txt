DESCRIPTION:

MB-37402: Use SeqnoAdvanced to ensure a consumer is aware of snapShotEnd

Use SeqnoAdvanced to ensure that a consumer is told that the there are
no more mutations to be sent by the producer. This is done by sending a
SeqnoAdvanced op which contains a seqno of the snapEnd to signify the
there are no more DcpOps to be sent in this snapshot.

For example:
1) A backfill snapshot for a vbucket contains no mutations for
collection A, but collection B has many mutations meaning the vbucket
seqno X > 2. But a backfill stream for collection A would be told about
the DcpSnapShotMarker and DcpSystemEvent but would then wait for other
mutations as the SnapEnd = X, which will have all been filtered out.
Thus adding a SeqnoAdvanced allows us to inform the consumer the
snapshot had come to the end.

2) The last item in the Snapshot isn't visible to the consumer. This can
occur if the consumer supports collections but does not support
sync writes. As the snapEnd would be sent as the vbucket high seqno but
the last item in the snapshot could be prepare or an abort. Thus, we
need to inform that snapshot has come to an end using the SeqnoAdvanced
Dcp opcode.

Line:450, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> no doubting this is correct - just not sure what cases this covers :) (will ping you on slack)

Line:955, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> SeqnoAdvanced should just override getBySeqno so there's no need to change this

Line:1226, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.h -> as mentioned, override getBySeqno, you could do both, but possibly cleaner to just have the one method

Line:6005, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> add a brief comment for each test, mainly highlighting the diffeences between each one as they're subtly different

Line:2276, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> can you add a variant of this test where we store two items, flush, delete the two items, flush and then stream. So collection exists and is empty, should get a sys-event + seqno advanced i think

Line:59, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_durability_collections_dcp_test.cc -> for each event/mutation also test the collection-id is as expected (producers.last_collection_ud i think)
