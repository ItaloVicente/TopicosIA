DESCRIPTION:

MB-37402: Use SeqnoAdvanced to ensure a consumer is aware of snapShotEnd

Use SeqnoAdvanced to ensure that a consumer is told that the there are
no more mutations to be sent by the producer. This is done by sending a
SeqnoAdvanced op which contains a seqno of the snapEnd to signify the
there are no more DcpOps to be sent in this snapshot.

For example:
1) A backfill snapshot for a vbucket contains no mutations for
collection A, but collection B has many mutations meaning the vbucket
seqno X > 2. But a backfill stream for collection A would be told about
the DcpSnapShotMarker and DcpSystemEvent but would then wait for other
mutations as the SnapEnd = X, which will have all been filtered out.
Thus adding a SeqnoAdvanced allows us to inform the consumer the
snapshot had come to the end.

2) The last item in the Snapshot isn't visible to the consumer. This can
occur if the consumer supports collections but does not support
sync writes. As the snapEnd would be sent as the vbucket high seqno but
the last item in the snapshot could be prepare or an abort. Thus, we
need to inform that snapshot has come to an end using the SeqnoAdvanced
Dcp opcode.

Line:1148, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> @jim not to speak for Richard, but I assume it's because snapshot receives the items pre-filtered, and the desire was to be able to send the SeqnoAdvanced with the last seqno of outstandingItemsResult (so the highest seqno we have looked at, even if it gets filtered out).

Line:2027, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Seconded, not sure they need to be treated differently.

I'd suggest not checking the readyQ directly in case the items were read off quickly (which looks possible in the backfill side?). But, we do track lastReadSeqno which should be equivalent.

Line:1148, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> James is right, as we filter the mutations before calling snapshot() we don't know what the true snapshot endseqno is. Thus we must record it and pass it on to snapshot() so we can used the correct snapEnd and know when to send a SeqnoAdvanced.

Line:1291, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> yes this is to expose the the true snapEnd as we filter out any non visible items. (see above)

Line:1349, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> don't we need to send the SeqnoAdvanced at the end of the snapshot? Adding it to the queue just after we add the SnapshotMarker would mean it would come before any mutations.

Line:2027, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Fixed :D

Line:1148, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> understood, can we get comment covering this as the reason isn't clear?

Line:1349, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> What I mean is we only need to execute line 1349 for each snapshot marker pushed (which is line 1328), i'm not suggesting moving this call, it still needs to come after the loop 1345:1347, but only for each snapshot marker, otherwise it looks (unproven) like we could end up 

[snapshot][key1][seqno-adv][key2][seqno-adv][snapshot]...

When it should be, 0 or 1 seqno-advanced per snapshot:

[snapshot][key1][key2][seqno-adv][snapshot]...

Things may have changed, but the ::snapshot function can be called >1 times for the loop in ::processItems, and each ::snapshot call doesn't push a snapshot marker

Line:1148, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> I don't understand why ths function is changed? I'd expect to see ::snapshot and ::completeBackfill, but not sure what this is doing?

Is this trying to handle a case where we may generate [snapshot-marker][mutations...][snapshot-marker]... in call of processItems?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2027, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> I'm still not sure we need the distinction, i.e. one test should cover all cases? For all SnapshotMarker's that get queued the lastSentSnapEndSeqno is written to (for backfill - ::markDiskSnapshot() and in-memory ::snaphot()), so we only need to compare the seqno of readyQ.back to know if we're in a situation where the snapshot falls short of the end.
