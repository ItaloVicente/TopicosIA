DESCRIPTION:

The endpoint is only exposed if in a serverless deployment. It has the
same privilege requirements as the other endpoints, namely

 cb::rbac::Privilege::Stats

Line:107, daemon/buckets.cc -> Does it make sense to expose this derived stat explicitly, given it can be trivially determined by summing rcu & wcu?

Line:2535, statistics/stat_definitions.json -> Could you document these please - for example "rcu" & "wcu" are not particulary meaningful in the abstract.

Line:107, daemon/buckets.cc -> I've commented to that effect on the spec - ditto for credit_cu_total. For now I'm going for parity with the regulator impl, which  does record and expose this

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:107, daemon/buckets.cc -> We have final confirmation that the CCUs should be used for representing compute capacity units; so the meter_cu_total should be removed from the KV endpoint, and meter_ccu_total can be added if/when KV has compute-y things (e.g. CPU * memory) they will be metering.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:107, daemon/buckets.cc -> These are the compute units, not the sum of WCU+RCU (per the discussion in #kv_engine today). AFAIK KV doesn't meter any compute units currently, in that case this counter should not be emitted at all.

or rather, do not need to be emitted, if they stay at 0.

To avoid confusion, I have renamed the _cu metrics to _ccu metrics in my latest regulator patch.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:107, daemon/buckets.cc -> I'd prefer to keep it exposed but zero (as in the latest patchset). It simplifies plumbing in a value in the future, and is unambiguous to a querier - if it's absent the person using it needs to be aware that KV is intentionally not exposing it vs it's missing because of a bug or exposed with wrong name etc
