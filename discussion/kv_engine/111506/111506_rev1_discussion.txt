DESCRIPTION:

Add labels to (Atomic)Monotonic

Add support for a label to be associated with the (Atomic)Monotonic
template class instantiations. This aids in reporting of monotonic
invariants being broken - previously there was little context on
exactly what had failed. Example output:

    Monotonic<x> (ActiveDM(vb:0)::State::lastAbortedSeqno) invariant failed: new value (302) breaks invariant on current value (303)
