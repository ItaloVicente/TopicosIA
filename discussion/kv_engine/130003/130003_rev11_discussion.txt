DESCRIPTION:

Use a script to start memcached on unix

Rename memcached to memcached.bin and install a script named
memcached to allow for setting environment variables before
invoking memcached.

Before starting memcached the following files may be sourced
(if found):

   etc/couchbase/kv/memcached.profile
   etc/couchbase/kv/memcached_asan.profile

I don't think this is a suitable patch to merge into standard production usage, as it will break many existing workflows where people try to do something with the `memcached` process / binary. For example `pgrep memcached` will now give the pid of the wrapper, not the real binary, breaking things like gdb  attach or monitoring via top.

For development (cluster_run) we can already set any environment variables we want before running `./cluster_run`. For production systems (or QE testing) then modifying `ns_server/couchbase-server.sh.in` is the correct way to handle this - perhaps having that script optionally source another "couchbase-env" script if present.

That's not true.. we're calling exec which _replace_ the current pid with the real binary so attaching gdb and monitoring via top works as expected

Problem is that couchbase-server.sh.in sets the environment for _ALL_ child processes of ns_server; not just memcached.. which for instance cause port_sigar to behave differently etc.

(and if you happen to copy in a new memcached binary over this one in your dev phase you'd end up with how it used to be so it shouldn't give you any problems.. except that its harder to do stuff with the environment in order to do testing).

Another issue is that for us it means to build a toy-build you'd always have to upload a minimum of two patches as I need a separate one for ns_server.

Its not the first time I've wanted to do stuff _before_ memached was started, and I'm pretty sure it won't be the last time. Given the burden on the ns-server team I don't expect them to fix MB-39770 anytime soon.

Ok, well that does address some of my compatibility concern - although I'm still not sure the extra complexity / indirection is justified.

It also means things like people's muscle-memory of typing `ldd memcached` need to be changed.

Well, the "behave differently" you're talking about here is ASAN settings which you probably want for all parts of the system - if port_sigar has bugs you probably don't want it creating massive core files, writing errors to stderr etc.


...

I (grudgingly) might be ok with this, as perhaps it's the lesser of the evils to achieve what you want - but I'm also worried about any unforeseen issues this might have. You'll recall the brief discussion we had about renaming 'memcached' to 'cbdatad' or similar...
Line:244, daemon/CMakeLists.txt -> Much simpler if you just define a variable MEMCACHED_EXE or similar which is conditional on the platform, then we don't have to repeat all the identical add_executable stuff.

Line:26, daemon/memcached.bash -> Personally I think this is overkill - let this script just source a single file and exec memcached; if the user wants different environment variables in different scenarios they can do that in the single memcached.profile file.

Line:29, tests/testapp_cluster/CMakeLists.txt -> ... and you'd avoid this conditional with a variable.

Line:141, tests/testapp_cluster/node.cc -> Could even pass the variable as a preprocessor (-D) arg to testapp_cluster to avoid this.

Not really - we could have ns_server's couchbase-server.sh.in _always_ check for some particular file to source before starting up, and that file could be added in a single patch - or left on the test system you're running on which requires zero patches.

Line:244, daemon/CMakeLists.txt -> Done

Line:26, daemon/memcached.bash -> I've nuked the other file and left only a single file. 

The idea here was two things:

1) We could start pushing the normal profile with the stuff we want (we initially allowed people to override the SSL cipher lists through an environment variable in a patch release, people had to set it though the couchbase-server script and now we could have set it in "our own" file and not have to worry about side effects if other modules used the same variables which wanted a different syntax).

2) we have a default version in our SCM which one could just uncomment the install entry for and it will work (without having to google for the syntax and the options to enable)..

Line:29, tests/testapp_cluster/CMakeLists.txt -> Done
