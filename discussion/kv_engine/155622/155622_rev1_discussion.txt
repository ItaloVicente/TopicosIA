DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: DcpIface to use references over gsl::not_null<>

Replace gsl::not_null<const CookieIface*> with const CookieIface&

This patch was created following these steps:
1. Use CLion's refactor signature functionality for each method in
DcpIface.
2. Add derefs of cookies where needed, found by compiling the source
code.

One thing I was thinking about is that perhaps we should "alias" the CookieIface here as DCP is a bit special as it is more a "connection" property. Right now we treat DCP really special by that we always lock the "first" cookie, and we cannot accept more than a single cookie on a DCP connection.

We don't want to allow for reorder on a DCP connection, but it seems wrong to use the "input" cookie for the message-producers in step(). Eventually I think that should take the "connection" object, but that's quite a way to clean up all the way.

Would it make sense to do something like:

    using DcpCookieIface = CookieIface;

Start by migrating everything DCP cookie-related to that? @daver

Seems reasonable. I think that can be a follow-up patch though?

Line:395, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Alternatively you could change the type of the `cookie` member to be a reference and then you'd avoid all this boilerplate change (and be more correct given I expect the cookie shouldn't be passed in as null).

Line:395, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> That's fine; but it'll be a bit of hokey-cokey given you'll be changing all these lines back to how they were; hence you've broken git blame for them.

Not really a big deal for test code, but in general it's a good idea to minimise the scope of a patch (and not have patch A change a few dozen lines; then patch B change them back).

Line:395, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> I've had a look at the code in more detail and we use the cookie as a pointer nearly as many times as we use it as a ref so we would need to add a load of refs when passing it to other interfaces. Basically it's a bit of a rabbit hole and I don't want to get this patch bogged down in changing other interfaces that didn't use gsl::not_null<> as otherwise it don't become clear what, should and shouldn't be in this patch.

Line:395, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Well, the patch is about passing a reference to the DCP methods; you could achieve that in one of two ways ;)

You'll note I +2'd the patch, I'm more pointing this out for future reference...
