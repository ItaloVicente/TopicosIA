DESCRIPTION:

Remove all uses of cb::strnstr()

This function was added for platforms which don't implement 'strnstr'
(i.e. Windows); however we only use it in two places; and in those two
places there is a better choice of a type-safe find() method on the
const_char_bufffer. As such remove the two uses (which lets us remove
the now-unused functions from platform).
