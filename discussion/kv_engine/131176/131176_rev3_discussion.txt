DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Move leb128 decode to be a member function

Upcoming changes to make leb128 'decode' check for non-canonical
inputs would like to use protected/private helper functions.

This patch also removes the tagged parameter for throw vs no-throw
in favour of a different function name.
