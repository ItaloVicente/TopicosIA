DESCRIPTION:

Use logger directly in the core

Changed the LOG_ macros used in the core and call
them directly instead of going through the old
logger interface using the printf-style of formatting

Line:108, daemon/connection_listen.cc -> As an aside; we might want to look into how costly logger::get() is; as it's currently copying a shared_ptr every time it's called...

Line:296, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Nit: you could simplify this and move the format string directly into LOG_WARNING()

Line:490, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Remove the \n ?

Line:1042, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Do we want to put the connection Id in front of this message (like the others)?

Line:1048, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Same

Line:30, daemon/cookie.cc -> Nit: should be between lines 26-27

Line:858, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> I think this should be {:x} if you want hex formatting.

Line:868, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> same

Line:111, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> {:x} ?

Line:119, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> same

Line:162, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> same

Line:664, daemon/subdocument.cc -> {:x}

Line:108, daemon/connection_listen.cc -> Yeah.. Probably worth keeping LOG_DEBUG out of our hot path ;-) (and get a microbenchmark up'n'running)

Line:296, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> yeah.. To avoid introducing a bug I'll just leave it "as is" for now (as it'll all go away when we move over to bufferevents)

Line:490, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Done
