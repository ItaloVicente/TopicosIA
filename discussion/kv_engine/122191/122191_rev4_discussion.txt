DESCRIPTION:

MB-37772: Use KVFileHandle with getWithHeader

KVStore exposes a getWithHeader method that is used in
rollback, it is intended to be used for issuing reads
against the rolled-back data file, it uses void* for
accepting a 'handle' to the open file.

This patch changes getWithHeader to take the KVFileHandle
in-place of void*.
