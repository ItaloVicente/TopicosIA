DESCRIPTION:

MB-27661 [10/n]: Fix MSVC warnings - C4267

This patch addresses the following generated warnings:

C4267 - var : conversion from 'size_t' to 'type', possible loss of data
        The compiler detected a conversion from size_t to a smaller type.

Since there are a lot of these warnings, use multiple commits to sort
them out to make reviewing easier.
