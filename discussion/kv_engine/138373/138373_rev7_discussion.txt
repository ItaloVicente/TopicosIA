DESCRIPTION:

MB-42029: FollyExecPool: Wait for tasks cancelled in unregisterTaskable

+Issue+

When enabling FollyExecutorPool by default, TSan reports the following
race when running ./ep-engine_ep_unit_tests
"--gtest_filter=DurabilityRespondAmbiguousTest.*":

The crux of this issue seems to be that a background AuxIO task run
via the FollyExecutorPool is deleting a VBucket object concurrently
with the main thread deleting an EPStats object.

+Background+

Details of how CB3ExecutorPool and FollyExecutorPool implement
{{unregisterTaskable()}}, which I believe is what leads to this
problem.

CB3ExecutorPool:

During CB3ExecutorPool::unregisterTaskable():

1. CB3ExecutorPool::_stopTaskGroup() is called and will wait for
   VBucketMemoryDeletionTask to run.

2. When VBucketMemoryDeletionTask::run() is call it returns false.

3. CB3ExecutorThread will then synchronously call
   CB3ExecutorThread::cancelCurrentTask() ->
   CB3ExecutorPool::cancel(). That removes all Cb3ExecutorPool-owned
   references to task, and hence will run VBucketMemoryDeletionTask
   dtor.

4. VBucketMemoryDeletionTask dtor frees the VBucket object.

As such, by the time CB3ExecutorPool::unregisterTaskable() returns the
VBucket is *guaranteed* to have been freed.

FollyExecutorPool:

During FollyExecutorPool::unregisterTaskable():

1. All tasks scheduled to run in future (owned by IO thread EventBase)
   are either cancelled (if allowed), or woken to run asap on CPU pool.

2. All tasks waiting to, or currently running on CPU pool are waited
   for by polling for taskOwners to no longer contain any tasks for
   the given taskable.

3. (On the CPU threads) Each queued task is run, on completion
   rescheduleTaskAfterRun is called to add work to the IO thread
   EventBase to decide when to reschedule, or (in this case) to
   actualy cancel the task.

4. (On the IO thread) FollyExecutorPool::rescheduleTaskAfterRun is
   called, for cancelled tasks this calls State::cancelTask() which
   removes the task from taskOwners - at which point TaskProxy dtor
   runs, which schedules _another_ task on CPU pool to actually delete
   the GlobalTask.

The problem here is that the TaskProxy is removed from taskOwners and
deletes at (4) on the IO thread; however the GlobalTask destruction is
deferred to later execution on a CPU thread. As such,
FollyExecutorPool::unregisterTaskable() can see taskOwners having no
tasks left for the taskable (and hence return) _before_ the VBucket
object is deleted.

Note the deferred deletion at (5) was added to avoid potentially large
amounts of work being done on the IO thread - we aim to minimise work
done here as it can impact the scheduling of other tasks.

+Solution+

If the TaskProxy removal from taskOwners is deferred until _after_ the
GlobalTask shared ownership is released, then unregisterTaskable()
will no longer return until all GlobalTask references inside
FollyExecutorPool have been released.

To achieve this changes the ownership model in FollyExecutorPool are
needed:

1. Don't immediately remove TaskProxy from taskOwners in cancelTask().
   Instead:
   a) Mark it as cancelled, by setting the GlobalTask ptr to null,
   b) Schedule an asynchronous task to release its GlobalTask
      shared_ptr.

2. This new async task (setup in resetTaskPtrViaCpuPool) releases the
   TaskProxy's shared ownership on GlobalTask, then schedules an (IO
   thread) completion task to finally remove the TaskProxy from
   taskOwners.

unregisterTaskable() is unchanged - it still waits for the taskOwner
map for the given Taskable become empty; however given the above
changes that only happens once the GlobalTask reference has been
released.
