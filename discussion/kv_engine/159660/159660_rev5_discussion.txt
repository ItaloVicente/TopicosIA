DESCRIPTION:

Add mcifconfig

mcifconfig may be used to list/define/delete network interfaces
or set TLS properties:

     ./mcifconfig --port 12000 \
                  --user Administrator \
                  --password asdfasdf \
                  list
     [{
        "family": "inet",
        "host": "0.0.0.0",
        "port": 12000,
        "system": false,
        "tag": "",
        "tls": false,
        "type": "mcbp",
        "uuid": "f0c2cc45-617a-4821-85a8-225660a2d443"
     }]

     ./mcifconfig --port 12000 \
                  --user Administrator \
                  --password asdfasdf \
                   tls new-tls.json
    {
      "CA file": "/home/trond/tmp/timofey/certs/ca.pem",
      "certificate chain": "/home/trond/tmp/timofey/certs/chain.pem",
      "cipher list": {
        "TLS 1.2": "HIGH",
        "TLS 1.3": "TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256"
      },
      "cipher order": true,
      "client cert auth": "disabled",
      "minimum version": "TLS 1.2",
      "password": "not set",
      "private key": "/home/trond/tmp/timofey/certs/pkey.pem"
    }

Line:5, programs/mcifconfig/CMakeLists.txt -> Do we want to ship this to customers? If not then probably want to remove the install (or predicate on CB_PRODUCTION_BUILD so it still shows up in toy and local builds).

Line:5, programs/mcifconfig/CMakeLists.txt -> My primary reason for including it is that it is the "only" way to see the actual TLS properties actually being set on the node (we could probably use ns_server magic to see what it _thinks_ it had set it to, but we wouldn't know for sure if thats whats actually being used). Once interface creation is moved out of memcached.json it'll also offer a way to check that. Given that the on-disk-size isn't that big I figured it could be installed; and available to use by our support team if we ever encountered a bug where we would like to know that information. If we had had a "utility" package someone could install where contained such "handy tools" it would have been a better fit (like mctestauth to check which SASL mechanisms works for a user as some of them won't work for LDAP etc)..
