DESCRIPTION:

MB-32876: Re-enable QueueDirtyWithManyClosedUnrefCheckpoints in CBNT

Restore test 'QueueDirtyWithManyClosedUnrefCheckpoints' which was
previously running very slowly on kv-engine-ubench (CBNT).

Note that Docker has been upgraded on the host - 

from: docker-engine:amd64 (1.8.2-0~trusty)
to:   docker-ce 5:18.09.1~3-0~ubuntu-xenial

And the container restarted - which for the first run has restored
the job performance.

Will monitor on future runs to see if this is steady before finally
resolving this MB.

(This reverts commit 68d40a53c0dfa5137ccf5c7b03f4d0cd18c86cc3.)
