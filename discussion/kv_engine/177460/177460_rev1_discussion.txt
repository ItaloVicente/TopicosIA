DESCRIPTION:

Remove TSAN warning from stats_task

The stats work by creating a task scheduled on one of the
executors to run the actual stat call, and then the front
end pick up the result. Use atomics to read the status code
and for simplicity use folly/Synchronized with a simple mutex
to stash the stats kv-pairs
