DESCRIPTION:

Add eviction category of stats

To aid with debugging potential performance issues a new category of
eviction stats is created.

In this category we maintain a histogram to record the execution
frequency of items evicted from the hash table (a separate histogram is
used for active/pending vbuckets and replica vbuckets.)

We also maintain a histogram to record the threshold used when deciding
whether to evict items from the hash table (again, a separate histogram
is maintained for active/pending vbuckets and replica vbuckets.)

The stats can be retrieved using cbstats.  e.g.

./cbstats default:11210 -u xxx -p xxx eviction

The "eviction_values" histogram stats provide an aggregated view of
what the execution frequencies are for all the items that are examined
to see if they can be evicted when running the hifi_mfu algorithm.

The "eviction_threshold_values" histogram stats provide an aggregated
view of what threshold values are used during the running of the
hifi_mfu algorithm.

Example output:
