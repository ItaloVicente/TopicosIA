DESCRIPTION:

MB-44842: Remove CollectionID throwing constructor

CollectionID objects get frequently created, for example every
item update gets the CollectionID from the StoredValue as part
of the HashTable prologue function. As a result of this:

SerialisedDocKey::getCollectionID

is visible (0.2%) in update heavy workloads because of the extra work
involved in verification and setting up for a throw.

Given that mcbp_validators prevents any DocKey specifying
an ID in the reserved range, the checks in the frequently
called "getCollectionID" (there are a few) are not necessary
and should stream-line some hot code paths.
