DESCRIPTION:

Extend compaction context with a callback to get vbucket lock

The kvstore keeps a cached version of the vbucket state in memory,
but it is the bucket which owns the kvstore which owns the "locks"
and serialize write access to the vbucket.

Storage systems which allows compaction in parallel with the
flusher needs a way to syncronize the final compaction step and
update the cached values (without racing with the flusher)
