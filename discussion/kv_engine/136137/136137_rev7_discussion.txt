DESCRIPTION:

Extend compaction context with a callback to get vbucket lock

The kvstore keeps a cached version of the vbucket state in memory,
but it is the bucket which owns the kvstore which owns the "locks"
and serialize write access to the vbucket.

Storage systems which allows compaction in parallel with the
flusher needs a way to syncronize the final compaction step and
update the cached values (without racing with the flusher)

This approach seems a little backwards / hard to follow the locking. Could you instead pass a `std::unique_lock(std::defer_lock_t)` to compactDB(); it can then actually lock the already-chosen mutex at the appropriate place?

Personally I think the best part to be to simplify the call chain all the way from ep_bucket.cc in doCompact to _ALWAYS_ get a locked vbucket ptr and handle the not-my-vbucket up there for all bucket types. It would eliminate the next call to getVBucket in compactInternal() and we could pass the unique_lock down to the underlying storage engine. The storage engine could then release the lock and do its own locking when it needed to.

The current situation where it is the ep_bucket which owns the per-vbucket lock to protect the per-vbucket variables in kvstore is a bit "confusing" already....

Line:148, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> This should point to EPBucket::makeCompactionContext so I don't understand why you've changed this but not the signature of EPBucket::makeCompactionContext.
