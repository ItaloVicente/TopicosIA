DESCRIPTION:

MB-26455: Allow correct processing of 'old' keys and separator changes

The collection's separator can only be changed when 0 collections
exist. However nothing stops the separator from changing if there are
deleted collections (and their keys) in play.

Prior to this commit each separator change resulted in a single system
event being mutated, that event had a static key. Thus a VB could have
the following sequence of keys/events.

    1  fruit::1
    2  fruit::2
    <fruit collection is deleted>
    <separator is changed from :: to - >
    <fruit collection is recreated>
    6  fruit-1
    7  fruit-2
    <fruit collection is deleted>
    <separator is changed from - to # >
    9  $collections_separator (the Item value contains the new separator)
    10 $collections::fruit (fruit recreated)
    11 fruit#1
    12 fruit#2

In this sequence, some of the changes are lost historically because a
static key is used for the separator change. Between seqno 2 and 6 the
separator changed from :: to -, but the separator change system event
is currently at seqno 9 with # as its value.

With this setup a problem exists if we were to process the historical
data e.g. whilst backfilling for DCP or performing a compaction
collection erase. The problem is that when we go back to seqno 1 and
2, we have no knowledge of the separator for those items,  all we have
is the current # separator. We cannot determine that fruit::1 is a
fruit collection key.

This commit addresses this problem by making each separator change
generate a unique key. The key itself will encode the new separator,
and because the key is unique it will reside at the correct point in
history for each separator change.

The unique key format will be:

    $collections_separator:<seqno>:<new_separator>

With this change the above sequence now looks as:

    1  fruit::1
    2  fruit::2
    <fruit collection is deleted>
    4  $collections_separator:3:- (change separator to -)
    <fruit collection is recreated>
    6  fruit-1
    7  fruit-2
    <fruit collection is deleted>
    9  $collections_separator:8:# (change separator to #)
    10 $collections::fruit (fruit recreated)
    11 fruit#1
    12 fruit#2

Now the code which looks at the historical data (e.g. backfill) will
encounter these separator change keys before it encounters collection
keys using that separator. Backfill and collections-erase can just
maintain a current separator and can no correctly break keys to
discover the collection they belong to. The collections eraser and
KVStore scanning code now include a collections context which has data
and associated code for doing this tracking.

A final piece of the commit is the garbage collection of these unique
keys. i.e. if each separator change puts a unique into the seqno
index, how can we clean these away when they're no longer needed (i.e.
all fruit:: keys purged).

Whilst the eraser runs it tracks all separator change
keys, because a separator change can only happen when 0 collections
exist, it can assume that all but the latest separator change key are
redundant once the erase has completed. This list of keys
are simply deleted in the normal way by pushing a deleted Item into
the checkpoint once compaction is complete.

Looks good - just some minor things.
Line:70, /COMMIT_MSG -> Extra word here?

Line:73, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_dockey.h -> This feels a bit large to be in the header (and force-inlined).

Line:36, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> Note we shouldn't use _ prefixed identifiers as they are reserved - see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/identifiers

It's probably ok if you #undef these after they are used here (I'm assuming you only need them to build the constant strings below.

(Having said that, I actually think it would be more readable to just define the constant keys below directly with the strings which represent them - but if you prefer this style then no problem).

File Comment: engines/ep/src/collections/eraser_context.h -> Could you add a class / file header explaining the purpose of this.
Line:47, engines/ep/src/collections/eraser_context.h -> maybe clearer to name this something like "staleSeperatorChangeKeys"  - to make it more explicit that they are disjoint to lastSeparatorChangeKey.

File Comment: engines/ep/src/collections/scan_context.h -> Same here - could you explain what this class is used for?
