DESCRIPTION:

MB-26455: Allow correct processing of 'old' keys and separator changes

A separator change event was only allowed when there are 0 active
collections, however a change is allowed whilst logically deleted
collections (and their keys) exist. Each separator change resulted
in a single system event operating against a single system key. Thus
a VB could have the following sequence of keys.

    1  fruit::1
    2  fruit::2
    <fruit was deleted here>
    <separator was changed here>
    <fruit was recreated here>
    6  fruit-1
    7  fruit-2
    <fruit was deleted here>
    9  $collections::separator (value contains the new separator)
    10 $collections::fruit (fruit recreated)
    11 fruit#1
    12 fruit#2

The sequence hides some changes because we use unique keys, between
seqno 2 ... 6 the separator must of changed from :: to -.

The core issue is that when we process the old keys, e.g. whilst
backfilling for DCP or performing collection deletion within
compaction, seqno 1 and 2 will be incorrectly processed as the VB
manifest has a separator of '#', we cannot correctly process fruit::
or fruit- keys.

The chosen solution is to ensure that each separator change generates
a unique key, and we will embed the new separator in the key so we
don't have to fetch values on code paths that are just doing
key-scans. Thus our example sequence now looks as follows.

    1  fruit::1
    2  fruit::2
    <fruit was deleted here>
    4  $collections_separator::3::-
    <fruit was recreated here>
    6  fruit-1
    7  fruit-2
    <fruit was deleted here>
    9  $collections_separator-8-#
    10 $collections::fruit (fruit recreated)
    11 fruit#1
    12 fruit#2

Now using these unique separator change keys, any code scanning the
keys will encounter separator change events at the correct point in
time, they can then break the key apart and move to the new separator
before processing the subsequent keys. The collections eraser and
KVStore scanning code now include a collections context which has
data and code for doing this tracking.

A final piece of the commit is the garbage collection of these unique
keys. Whilst the eraser runs it tracks all historical separator change
keys, because a separator change can only happen when 0 collections
exist, it can assume that all but the latest separator change key are
redundant once the compaction/erase has completed. This list of keys
are simply deleted in the normal way by pushing a deleted Item into
the checkpoint once compaction is complete.
