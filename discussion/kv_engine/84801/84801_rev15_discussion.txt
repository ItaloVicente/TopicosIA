DESCRIPTION:

MB-26455: Allow correct processing of 'old' keys and separator changes

A separator change event is only allowed when there are 0 open
collections, however a change is allowed whilst logically deleted
collections (and their keys) exist.

Previously on Collections, each separator change resulted in a single
system event operating against a single system key. Thus a VB could
have the following sequence of keys/events.

    1  fruit::1
    2  fruit::2
    <fruit was deleted here>
    <separator was changed here>
    <fruit was recreated here>
    6  fruit-1
    7  fruit-2
    <fruit was deleted here>
    <separator again changed>
    9  $collections_separator (value contains the new separator)
    10 $collections::fruit (fruit recreated)
    11 fruit#1
    12 fruit#2

The sequence hides some changes because we use a static key for the
separator change, between seqno 2 ... 6 the separator changed from
:: to -.

A problem now exists if we were to process the historical data e.g. whilst
backfilling for DCP or performing collection erase (which scans all keys).
The problem with this processes is with seqno 1 and 2 we don't know that
they have a separator of ::, all we have is the # separator. We cannot
determine that fruit::1 is a fruit collection key.

This commit changes how we operate and ensures that each separator change generates
a unique key, and we will embed the new separator in that key. Now when we have
a historical scan, we will see change separator markers embedded at the point in
seqno time they occurred.

The unique key format will be (note this commit makes all system keys
use a fixed separator, no need to muddy our waters with the users
separator).

$collections_separator:<seqno>:<new_separator>

The above sequence now looks like:

    1  fruit::1
    2  fruit::2
    <fruit was deleted here>
    4  $collections_separator:3:- (change separator to -)
    <fruit was recreated here>
    6  fruit-1
    7  fruit-2
    <fruit was deleted here>
    9  $collections_separator:8:# (change separator to #)
    10 $collections::fruit (fruit recreated)
    11 fruit#1
    12 fruit#2

Now using these unique separator change keys, any code scanning the
keys will encounter separator change events at the correct point in
time, they can then break the key apart and move to the new separator
before processing the subsequent keys. The collections eraser and
KVStore scanning code now include a collections context which has
data and code for doing this tracking.

A final piece of the commit is the garbage collection of these unique
keys. Whilst the eraser runs it tracks all historical separator change
keys, because a separator change can only happen when 0 collections
exist, it can assume that all but the latest separator change key are
redundant once the compaction/erase has completed. This list of keys
are simply deleted in the normal way by pushing a deleted Item into
the checkpoint once compaction is complete.
