DESCRIPTION:

MB-27457: [6/n] Allow DCP producer to send the delete time

The DCP producer will need to send any delete_time it gets from
disk to clients which have enabled the feature.

1. Add a new DCP open flag to the protocol
2. Have the producer track the state of this flag (on/off)
3. When on, an alternative dcp_delete callback is used which can
 accept the delete_time parameter.

This commit only updates KV-engine, subsequent commits will link up
to the real connection.

A test is added which shows that a backfilled item passes its delete
time through DCP.
