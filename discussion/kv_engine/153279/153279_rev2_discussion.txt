DESCRIPTION:

MB-46046: [1/5] Make HdrHistogram iters follow typical C++ iter semantics

Begin updating HdrHistogram::Iterator to meet more requirements of
`LegacyInputIterator`.

With this, histograms can be iterated in the typical C++ style

 for (auto iter = foo(); iter != end(); iter++)

Or, for the default iteration mode:

 for (const auto& bucket: histogram)

This patch does not update all users of the iterators, rather
`Iterator::getNextValueAndCount()` and friends remain as shims for now,
implemented using `operator++`. These will be removed in a future
patch.
