DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Refactor magma compaction to be more robust

The current shared_ptr logic was not working and still provided
potential for data race conditions. This checkin closes those data race
conditions by making a copy of compaction_ctx to allow for both explicit
and implicit compactions to look at the context safely.

Please note: This is still a stop gap solution until kv team provided a
callback function to retrieve compaction context.
