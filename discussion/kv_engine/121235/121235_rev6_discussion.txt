DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Refactor magma compaction to be more robust

The current shared_ptr logic was not working and still provided
potential for data race conditions. This checkin closes those data race
conditions by making a copy of compaction_ctx to allow for both explicit
and implicit compactions to look at the context safely.

Please note: This is still a stop gap solution until kv team provided a
callback function to retrieve compaction context.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> I know this has been talked about, but is there an MB you've raised for this task?

Line:138, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> a shared_ptr would normally be used to allow multiple threads access to the same object and give a reasoned mechanism for safe deletion, in this case it doesn't look like that is the case, but the use of shared_ptr here is because you want a copy internally in magma and the code won't compile as unique_ptr has no copy constructor?

In that case it, i'd suggest adding a copy constructor to the compaction_ctx class and deep copy the eraserContext
