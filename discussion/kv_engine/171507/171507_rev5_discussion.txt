DESCRIPTION:

MB-51240: Use cb::Semaphore to count ItemAccessVisitor

MB identified that the way the AccessScanner checks if visitors
are still running is flawed, allowing the AccessScanner to become
permanently disabled.

This commit makes use of a cb::Semaphore to do reference counting of
the visitor tasks and removes our manual (flawed) counting.
