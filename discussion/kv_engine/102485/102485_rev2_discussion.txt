DESCRIPTION:

Add convenience methods to use char buffers in framebuffer

A lot of in of our unit tests we use a std::string or
char* for the key, but the framebuilder expects a
byte buffer (we've not eliminated one of them yet).

For simplicity start by adding a wrapper method in
the framebuffer to avoid having to cast all over
the place.
