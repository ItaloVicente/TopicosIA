DESCRIPTION:

MB-44562: Rename ActiveSnoozingBackfills to RunningBackfills

ActiveSnoozingBackfills isn't a particularly good name, it could mean
active or snoozing or actively snoozing and we also include backfills
in the initializing state in this counter. Rename it to running
(not pending).

Change-Id: Ib91b6d3cb71cf463849b7bda0f1a6697d3ae0966
