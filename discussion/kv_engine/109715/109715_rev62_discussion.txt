DESCRIPTION:

MB-10291: Add support for OutOfOrder execution

If a command blocks as part of its execution pattern (returns
ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK) and there is more commands available in
the input pipe we might start execution of the next command
if the current command allows for that (only whitelisted
commands which we know don't have any side effects).

The current version allows a connection to execute up to 32
commands "in parallel".

Line:542, daemon/connection.cc -> 1s might even be too conservative here - if the bucket is getting deleted, does it really matter if we let the client finish their current request? I mean the bucket isa about to be gone forever...

Line:674, daemon/connection.cc -> Maybe add @todo to this to aid finding it later.

Line:963, daemon/connection.h -> Nit: We can probably drop this down to a char represenation (if we want to save a bit of space in Connection...)

Line:1030, daemon/connection.h -> As per the later review comments; if we still need address stability for elements worth documenting that here. Also you say a list is being used but it's currently a deque.

Line:1081, daemon/connection.h -> Style: "check..." implies to me this will return some result about the Queue. if the only action is to shutdown the connection if it is stuck, I think it would be better to name this something like "shutdownIfSendQueueStuck()" to make it explicit in the name what it actually does.

Line:1089, daemon/connection.h -> Style: "process.." is somewhat vague. Based on the description, what about something like "executeReadyCookies()" ?

Line:72, daemon/cookie.h -> Style: prefer

 return !packet;

See http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-if

Line:482, daemon/cookie.h -> If we haven't documented it elsewhere, suggest documenting the barrier / reorder concept.

Line:57, tests/testapp_cluster/out_of_order_tests.cc -> You might want to look at expanding these tests by using ewouldblock_engine to precisely control what stages of commands return ewouldblock and which done - given that a number of different sub-stages can return it.

Line:542, daemon/connection.cc -> I chose 1 as that would be the lowest std::chrono::seconds value I could use (and I'm using const auto to shorten the line....).. I guess we can all live with an extra second wait time in the worst case ;) )

Line:674, daemon/connection.cc -> Done

Line:963, daemon/connection.h -> sure... the entire class can be "compacted" by reordering members and fix alignment

Line:1030, daemon/connection.h -> Done

Line:1081, daemon/connection.h -> Done

Line:1089, daemon/connection.h -> Done

Line:72, daemon/cookie.h -> Done

Line:482, daemon/cookie.h -> Done

Line:57, tests/testapp_cluster/out_of_order_tests.cc -> Yes.. This is a "quick and dirty" way to test that we don't start on the next command before one command is completed (as the evicted documents would at least return one ewb and the other ones _should_ be resident and not return ewb (we have of course no guarantee for that))....
