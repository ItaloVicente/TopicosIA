DESCRIPTION:

MB-10291: Add support for OutOfOrder execution

If a command blocks as part of its execution pattern (returns
ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK) and there is more commands available in
the input pipe we might start execution of the next command
if the current command allows for that (only whitelisted
commands which we know don't have any side effects).

The current version allows for up to 32 commands being run
in parallel.

Change-Id: I2978d51ab63bbe922299c7c5a381c06e954dfd6e
