DESCRIPTION:

MB-10291: Add support for OutOfOrder execution

If a command blocks as part of its execution pattern (returns
ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK) and there is more commands available in
the input pipe we might start execution of the next command
if the current command allows for that (only whitelisted
commands which we know don't have any side effects).

The current version allows a connection to execute up to 32
commands "in parallel".

This is a pretty huge patch!

Before I start looking at it, is it possible to split it?

It is changing some of the core logic (by dropping all of the state machinery logic etc), so it wasn't that easy to make it smaller.. I could probably try to nuke out the "parallellism" out of the patch, but that isn't very and would just introduce more work ;)

There is some "unresolved problems" I'll try to work out in the next patches (right now we're always taking a copy of the packages due to subdoc keeping some pointers into the input buffer around).

I'd still appreciate a "first scrub" over the patch so that I can change stuff iteratively ;)

Sure, I'll take a look through. 

At the least you could probably avoid deleting the old statemachine code in this initial patch, and moving to a follow up patch.

(11 comments)

Only partway through, but some initial comments...
Line:539, daemon/connection.cc -> Suggest making these config parameters; or at least document the choice of them here.

Line:542, daemon/connection.cc -> Suggest including the limit in the log message (useful to see if just missed it or a lot longer).

Line:591, daemon/connection.cc -> Why not just call erase() unconditionally - it always returns an iterator to the following element.

Line:634, daemon/connection.cc -> Seems like this would be simpler / faster with something like a std::vector<Cookie> so you don't force a heap allocation for every command (std::make_unique).

Line:752, daemon/connection.cc -> Suggest we address this before merging.

Line:665, daemon/connection.h -> This comment is a little vague - what's a callback? what time in the future? Maybe link to some other description of how this callback mechanism works if there's details elsewhere.

Line:1010, daemon/connection.h -> Needs updating.

Line:1016, daemon/connection.h -> Do we actually want a std::list here, given it'll generally be both more costly in terms of memory and iteration - are we relying on stability of iterators? If so suggest documenting why std::list has been chosen.

Line:1043, daemon/connection.h -> Useful to document this.

Line:1098, daemon/connection.h -> If this must be non-null, prefer a reference.

Line:1108, daemon/connection.h -> Ditto

Line:539, daemon/connection.cc -> Added a comment describing why they're different

Line:542, daemon/connection.cc -> Changed the log messate to include the wait time.

Line:591, daemon/connection.cc -> Due to the way DCP currently work (they use the address of the cookie object as its identifier) we never remove the first entry in the list.

Line:634, daemon/connection.cc -> We might look into changing that in a later patch (as the the existing cookies lists (used elsewhere) already use a unique_ptr.

Line:752, daemon/connection.cc -> So I've _NEVER_ seen it happen so I can nuke the logging and just throw an exception (which will shut down the connection)

Line:665, daemon/connection.h -> Done

Line:1010, daemon/connection.h -> The entire paragraph is obsolete ;) updated it to reflect how it currently works.

Line:1016, daemon/connection.h -> Just for simplicity. We're currently iterating over the list, and while iterating over the list we might want to remove the current element before looking at the next one (which also could be removed etc).. we might look into changing all of this later on

Line:1043, daemon/connection.h -> Removed it.. It was used for debugging back in the days to see the number of times we hit a callback from libevent for a given connection)

Line:1098, daemon/connection.h -> This is the method signature required from bufferevent (the method we register in bufferevents)

Line:1108, daemon/connection.h -> ditto

(those changes are mostly a 1-liner in the file deleting the call to "setState"... personally I find it "harder" if we have two different setState methods in the patch where one is ignored and the other one is used?)

Line:634, daemon/connection.cc -> Thinking back I recall why I did it with the pointers... we provide the address of the cookie down to the underlying engine as part of the operation. If the operation "block" the engine keeps the address of the cookie and calls back.

With the _current_ model all of the commands is stored in the order they arrived (and we "compact" the list by removing them when they're done). This eliminates the "problem" where we need to find out the first available "slot" to put the next command, and if the command cannot be reordered we cannot start executing it before all of the previous commands has been successfully executed.

This could of course be fixed by creating a separate pointer within the cookie which points back to the real cookie and use the address of that pointer when calling down to the engine.

Anyway: I think we should just start with this and if it turns out to be a problem we can always optimize it later on.
