DESCRIPTION:

Remove Checkpoint::getMutationId()

Used only in Checkpoint::queueDirty for getting the seqno of the item
pointed by a cursor. We already have that information as a cursor keeps
a reference to the item it points to.

Triggered by MB-42780 (6.6.1), deferred to CC.

Line:292, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Is this correct? I note that mutation_id isn't aways the seqno:

 /**
  * The mutation_id is generally the bySeqno of the item. However, if this is
  * a SyncWrite expelled from the open checkpoint then the mutation_id is set
  * to 0 so that we can make our de-dupe checks

Line:292, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Mmm I think that the "mutation_id = 0" thing is not necessary, see the doc of Checkpoint::expelItems():

> Expel those items in the checkpoint where all cursors have passed.

Need to check what we mean with "passed", as in the checkpoint logic an item pointed by cursor indicates that the cursor has already processed the item..

Line:292, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> iirc we keep indexes of memory checkpoints and expel will set the mutation id for the index entry to 0 and we could then check the index when trying to do dedupe logic when we queue a new item

Line:292, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> that's correct
all the point here is: are we ever expelling an item that is pointed by a cursor?
If the answer is NO then we are sure that we can always do (auto cursor_mutation_id = cursor_item->getBySeqno()) here.
If the answer is YES we need to keep things as they are.. or we modify the expel logic so that it expel everything up to the "lowest cursor EXCLUDED"

Line:292, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> I'm obviously checking that out very carefully, but it seems sounds strange to me that we expel something that is pointed by a cursor.. as I don't see any "cursor repositioning" logic at expel. Will see

Line:292, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Believe we go to the first cursor then decrement back to the first valid item when expelling so we should never expel the item a cursor points to

If there's doubt on exactly if this is needed (and it's not simple to confirm) then I suggest it's deferred to CC.next.

We need to solve https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-45026 before proceeding here.

Line:292, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> So I've reviewed this one.
Summary is that the following invariant applies:

    getMutationId(*cursor.second) === cursor_item->getBySeqno()

That's because:
   1. IndexEntry::mutationId is always the item bySeqno apart from the special case of "expelled SyncWrites"
   2. By logic, if a cursor is *currently* pointing to an item then the item is there (not expelled), so mutation-id in the index is exactly the bySeqno.
      Note: that doesn't mean that an item pointed by a cursor cannot be expelled. That just means that cursor_mutation_id is just the seqno of the pointed item, so we don't need to go via the index for getting it.

No need to solve anything before merging this. Still pushing to CC.Next though.
