DESCRIPTION:

MB-32021: Don't assume dcp v1 delete isn't collections

The DCP delete v1 historically wasn't collection applicable
because the extras deliberatley weren't changed to include a
collection-len field (from the old implementation which used
names as collection-IDs).

Now we can safely support DCP delete v1 with collections and
the executor should just follow the DocKey creation of the
other DCP executors.
