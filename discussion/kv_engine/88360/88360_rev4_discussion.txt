DESCRIPTION:

MB-27699 CouchRocks: Total Memtables size as ratio of the Bucket Quota

The Memtable is the write cache in RocksDB.
So far we have exposed to the user configuration the absolute values for
the size of the single Memtable for the 'default' and 'seqno' CFs.
But, what we actually want is to size the total Memtable Cache as a
ratio of the Bucket Quota, and then let kv-engine to decide how to split
the total Quota among Column Families.
So, with this change we introduce the new 'rocksdb_memtables_ratio'
parameter.
Recent Perftests and further investigation have shown that the total
Memtables Quota has an impact on the throughput (MB-27552). Setting the
Memtables Quota to 10% of the Bucket Quota seems a reasonable baseline
choice. Thus, we use 0.1 as default value for the new parameter.

Line:229, engines/ep/src/kvstore_config.h -> Maybe explain what zero means here.

Line:1522, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Might be worth adding a comment here, describing what happens to existing memtables - do they get instantly resized, or does it only come into effect when the next memtable is created?

Line:1523, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Can be const.

Line:1615, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Do we need to take a mutex here (in case something else adds / removes elements from the vbHandles?

Line:455, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> Can this method be const?

Line:1615, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Yes we need to hold a lock on 'vbhMutex' here, as well as in the 'applyMemtablesQuota' function. 
But, 'getVBucketCount' is called (for now) only from 'applyMemtablesQuota', which in turn is always called by functions that already hold a lock on 'vbhMutex'.
I added comment like this on both the 'applyMemtablesQuota' and 'getVBucketCount' functions:

> ..must be called under lock on 'vbhMutex', so that the number of VBuckets seen is consistent.

Line:1615, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Comments are weak - the compiler cannot check them ;)

Instead, pass a reference to a lock_guard; this isn't used by the function but it ensures that the caller has at least locked a lock of the same type.
