Line:84, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> We should also update the datatype documentation to mention this.

Note the other option is to take a bit from the magic - given the Framing Extras are about the actual protocol framing, this "feels" more correct; and stops us from consuming a bit in datatype which I expect we'll consume sooner.

Line:112, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> Now we have a total length of the framing extras, we don't need this bit anymore - can go back to a 4bit Object Identifier.
