DESCRIPTION:

MB-26363: Send "DCP_STREAM_END" msg for a single stream close

As per the protocol, a DCP producer is supposed to send a "STREAM_END"
when a DCP stream is closed by the client. Currently due to an
implementation bug we send "STREAM_END" only when the producer initiates
the stream close, not when the client closes the stream.

Since this bug is present for a long time, some DCP clients might
have been conditioned not to receive any messages after the stream close.
So to avoid any backward compatibility issues we are adding a new
control message "close_stream_async" which indicates the DCP producer
to send the "STREAM_END" message upon a stream close. That is,
if the DCP client sends this control message during the connection
set up, only then the producer sends the "STREAM_END" message.

Further, the control message "close_stream_async" is not recognised
by the older versions of the DCP producer and hence the clients
can adapt accordingly.

Lastly, clients that do not use this control message will not
notice any change in the producer behavior.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not sure this is the best name - isn't the new functionality actually making things /more/ synchronous; in that there will be a STREAM_END message synchronous with the mutations?

What about something like "enable_stream_end_on_client_close_stream"? Yes, it's very long / verbose; but it's only sent once per connection and (IMHO) is much clearer on what it actually does.

Line:1244, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Worth adding a comment here describing what it means to support this option.

Line:762, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Helpful to describe why we don't let the client disable this.

Another thought - did you look into using a STREAM_ADD flag for this instead of a control message? Given this is per-stream; and it doesn't make sense for it to be changed after a stream is created; that might be a cleaner solution...

STREAM_ADD is not fully helpful here as we also want the older producer versions of the producer to indicate to the client that they do not support sending the "STREAM_END" message.

Technically we could fail the stream add, but that would be a costlier operation at the client and server side as it is per stream
Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ok will use "stream_end_on_client_close_stream", thougt enable is not necessary as we have a "true" or "false" value associated with it

Line:1244, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Done

Line:762, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Done

Ok, that makes sense - I forgot that the STREAM_ADD would fail the first time. Let's stick with the control message.
