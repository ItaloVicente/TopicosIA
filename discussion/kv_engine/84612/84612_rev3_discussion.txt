DESCRIPTION:

MB-26363: Send "DCP_STREAM_END" msg for a single stream close

As per the protocol, DCP producers are supposed to send a "STREAM_END"
when a DCP stream is closed by the client. Currently due to an
implementation bug we send "STREAM_END" only when the producer initiates
the stream close, not when the client closes the stream.

This commit makes sure that DCP "STREAM_END" message is sent to
indicate the actual stream.

Note: This change may come as a surprise to the clients that are
      tuned to the wrong behavior. That is, clients must now
      handle the stream close asynchronously as per the protocol.

Patch Set 3:

Would it be possible to come up with some logic, or implement some behaviour that allows us to detect when we are going to need to internally generate a stream-end event?  Otherwise we risk not being able to have DCP clients operate correctly on both versions.
