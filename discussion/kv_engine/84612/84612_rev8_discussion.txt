DESCRIPTION:

MB-26363: Send "DCP_STREAM_END" msg for a single stream close

As per the protocol, a DCP producer is supposed to send a "STREAM_END"
when a DCP stream is closed by the client. Currently due to an
implementation bug we send "STREAM_END" only when the producer initiates
the stream close, not when the client closes the stream.

Since this bug is present for a long time, some DCP clients might
have been conditioned not to receive any messages after the stream close.
So to avoid any backward compatibility issues we are adding a new
control message "close_stream_async" which indicates the DCP producer
to send the "STREAM_END" message upon a stream close. That is,
if the DCP client sends this control message during the connection
set up, only then the producer sends the "STREAM_END" message.

Further, the control message "close_stream_async" is not recognised
by the older versions of the DCP producer and hence the clients
can adapt accordingly.

Lastly, clients that do not use this control message will not
notice any change in the producer behavior.
