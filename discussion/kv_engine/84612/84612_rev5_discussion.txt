DESCRIPTION:

MB-26363: Send "DCP_STREAM_END" msg for a single stream close

As per the protocol, DCP producers are supposed to send a "STREAM_END"
when a DCP stream is closed by the client. Currently due to an
implementation bug we send "STREAM_END" only when the producer initiates
the stream close, not when the client closes the stream.

This commit makes sure that DCP "STREAM_END" message is sent to
indicate the actual stream.

Note: This change may come as a surprise to the clients that are
      tuned to the wrong behavior. That is, clients must now
      handle the stream close asynchronously as per the protocol.

Do we have to prep the clients of this new message of, "STREAM_END" when a client is closed, before we merge the change ? Though this is part of our documentation, we never sent this all this while.

Is probably helpful. As per Brett's comment, why don't you discuss this with him?

Plz don't merge until we confirm that major DCP clients like ns-server, gsi, xdcr, views and SDKs are fine with this

Patch Set 5:

I checked with the different clients: GSI, XDCR, ns-server + replication, backup.. All are ok with the "DCP_STREAM_END" msg and in fact would prefer getting this message.

This "DCP_STREAM_END" msg, which comes as a new one when the client explicitly closes the stream, should not be a surprise to any correctly written clients. That is, even if they do not wait for this message and open back the stream (on the same vbucket), they should be then able to ignore this message with an opaque mismatch.

So I don't see a point in adding a new flag for this. We can merge the change as is
