DESCRIPTION:

MB-36956: Allow multiple ExecutorPool backends

To facilitate using a Folly executor-based ExecutorPool instead of our
Global Executor added in Couchbase 3.0, rename the existing
ExecutorPool class to 'CB3ExecutorPool', ExecutorThread to
CB3ExecutorThread, and make ExecutorPool a pure virtual interface.

Currently this still creates exactly the same CB3-style ExecutorPool,
it just adds an indirection to permit other implementations in future.
