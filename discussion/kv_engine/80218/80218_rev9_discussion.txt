Good spot that default and ep-engines behave differently for get_item_info. I think the solution should be to fix that, rather than working around the underlying problem.

(Btw, thanks for digging into this.  I know the scope has grown a bit - if you have other things you need to work on and want to hand this back over to KV-engine to fix just let me know).
Line:57, protocol/connection/client_connection.h -> I'd be hesitant to only initialise one of the member variables here and not all of them.

Note - given there's no custom constructor, you will get value initialization (to zero) as long as you call with empty initialiser list - e.g.

 DocumentInfo info{};

Line:114, tests/testapp/testapp_xattr.cc -> style: prefer std::stoi() as that will throw an exception if it fails, whereas atoi() just returns zero which is hard to differentiate from an actual string "0".

Line:57, protocol/connection/client_connection.h -> it seems like this used in a lot of places, and I prefer initializer to changing a lot of unrelated places.

I can add empty constructor and initialize everything with default values if you find this better.

Line:280, protocol/connection/client_mcbp_commands.cc -> This is where I rely on zero by default, otherwise a lot of tests fail because of garbage

Line:114, tests/testapp/testapp_xattr.cc -> Thanks. I'll fix that

Currently I have something else to do on libcouchbase, but the issue looks challenging to me and I would rather use it to explore engine internals over weekend.

If you don't qualify the issue critical, I would rather work on it in background, and update the patch a bit later.

Line:57, protocol/connection/client_connection.h -> Ideally we'd just leave the member definitions as-is, (i.e. don't provide /any/ default member initialisers), and use brace initialization (see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-list).

However, that does require that all users of the class create instances using brace initialization, which for a mix of old & new code is perhaps problematic.

Therefore I suggest that if you want to ensure default values for all members, then use default member initialisers - that requires the least amount of boilerplate (a constructor you created would basically be the same as the compiler-generated one) and ensures a consistent object.

That's absolutely fine. I wouldn't say the issue is critical, it would be good to get fixed for Spock GA but there's time for that yet.
