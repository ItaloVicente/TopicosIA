DESCRIPTION:

MB-49490: Replace memOverhead approx. with in-place calculated statistic

Instead of approximating the overhead associated with the toWrite queue,
use queueMemOverhead which accurately tracks it.

Since this would change the expression to be equivalent to
Checkpoint::getMemOverhead, also refactor to call this method instead.
