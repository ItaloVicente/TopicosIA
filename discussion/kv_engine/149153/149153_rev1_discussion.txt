DESCRIPTION:

Log slow operation as critical for DEV builds

The threshold for slow operations should be set so high that we
shouldn't be seeing them, but as part of introducing Prometheus
we had some locking issues which caused some unexpected operations
to be slow and we only discovered as a spin-off because a manual
inspection of the logs showed unexpected slow operations.

Log all slow operations as CRITICAL as long as we've set the
developer assert flag should make it easier to detect such
situations earlier.
