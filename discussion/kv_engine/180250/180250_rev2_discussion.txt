DESCRIPTION:

Add ConnectionIface

All cookies should be bound to a Connection, and this allows
us to look up the connection a cookie is bound to.

The primary motivation for this is to allow the underlying
engines to store the Connection object for a DCP connection
instead of the Cookie so that we no longer need to use
the same cookie object for all DCP related commands (and
the "magic" reuse of cookies[0] in the connections)
