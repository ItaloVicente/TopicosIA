DESCRIPTION:

MB-34094: WIP: Search for correct pending/committed item in persistence callbacks

When looking up the persisted item from the HashTable, search for the
correct pending / committed document, instead of using fetchValidValue
which will return Committed or Pending depending on the state of the
HashTable.

TODO: Needs unit test.
