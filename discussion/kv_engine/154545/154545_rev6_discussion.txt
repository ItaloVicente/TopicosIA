DESCRIPTION:

MB-38476: Update spdlog to v1.8.5 (KV)

Update spdlog to v1.8.5. This patch contains two things:

1) Fixes for the API updates between v1.1.0 and v1.8.5.
2) Changes to deal with the spdlog registry holding shared_ptrs
   (changes had been made to the old version to have the spdlog
   registry hold weak_ptrs). These include removing the dtor of
   BucketLogger to avoid recursive locking of the mutex in the
   spdlog registry and removal of the manual globalBucketLogger
   resets.

Change-Id: I81db06c75f63e8c0f56f410fc24c716549bbabc6
