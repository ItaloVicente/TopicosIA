DESCRIPTION:

MB-41510: Fix infinite loop due to HdrHistogram being reset

Currently if a HdrHistogram has its reset() method called by one thread
(T1) and is being read by another (T2) using an HdrHistoram::Iterator.
There is the race that could cause the HdrHistoram::Iterator() to enter
an infinite loop.

This occurs as HdrHistogram's getNextValue() methods use HdrHistogam_c's
hdr_iter_next() which intern uses the following function:
static bool has_next(struct hdr_iter* iter)
{
        return iter->cumulative_count < iter->total_count;
}
Which logically checks that the total count the Iterator was
initialize with is > than the sum of all the counts its read from the
buckets in the histogram. The trouble is, that the reset() method
changes the bucket counts back to 0. Thus, meaning the condition
cumulative_count >= total_count may never be met.

To fix this make the std::unique_ptr<struct hdr_histogram> as
std::shared_ptr. When we call HdrHistogram::reset(), we should create
a new std::shared<> and store under the histogram member. This will
mean that new calls to the HdrHistogram obj will see that the data has
been reset. But we can keep around the old struct hdr_histogram for use
with the Iterator as long as we keep a std::shared_ptr<> to it within
the HdrHistogram::Iterator. Once we've finished using the
HdrHistogram::Iterator the shared_ptr will destroy the struct for us
along with all its data.

We also need to a std::mutex to guard when modifying the
std::shared_ptr<> as its pointer value is not thread safe.
