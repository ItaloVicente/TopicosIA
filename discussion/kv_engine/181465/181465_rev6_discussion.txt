DESCRIPTION:

MB-52311: [7/n] Pause / Resume Bucket: Add cancellation support

If a Resume() request is made while a previous Pause() request is
still executing, we don't want to have to wait until the Pause()
completes before resuming. This is particulary important when
considering failover - if ns_server decides it needs to failover a
node it needs to being the Bucket back to the Ready state asap so it
can examine and/or set vBucket state to perform the failover.

As such, we want to be able to cancel a running Pause() operation if a
Resume() request arrives.

We do this using Cancellation Tokens - which Folly provides an
implementation. Quoting from folly/CancellationToken.h:

    A CancellationToken is an object that can be passed into an
    function or operation that allows the caller to later request that
    the operation be cancelled.

    A CancellationToken object can be obtained by calling the
    .getToken() method on a CancellationSource or by copying another
    CancellationToken object. All CancellationToken objects obtained
    from the same original CancellationSource object all reference the
    same underlying cancellation state and will all be cancelled
    together.

    If your function needs to be cancellable but does not need to
    request cancellation then you should take a CancellationToken as a
    parameter.  If your function needs to be able to request
    cancellation then you should instead take a CancellationSource as
    a parameter.

In terms of how this maps to kv_engine, we add a CancellationSource to
each Bucket object, and whenever a Pause() operation occurs we create
a CancellationToken from the Bucket's CancellationSource and pass the
token into the BucketManager (and later further down into the
engine). At suitable points in the pause process (typically before
some long-lived / blocking operation) the CancellationToken can be
checked to see if cancellation has been requested, if so then we
cancel the pause, undoing any steps in the Pause process which have
already been performed.

Note that one can also register CancellationCallbacks with the
CancellationToken (multiple callbacks can be registered). Each
callback can perform whatever necessary "undo" logic to revert the
back to the unpaused state.

To trigger cancellation, the Resume() method checks to see if
Cancellation is possible (i.e. a Pause request is in progress), and if
so requests cancellation and returns early - the cancelled Pause()
request is responsible for undoing any pause steps already executed.
