DESCRIPTION:

Disconnect the client as soon as we know the magic is invalid

If the magic is invalid we cannot trust the rest of the packet
either so audit the packet and disconnect immediately.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Not sure this is a good idea - it's true that if the magic is bad we cannot usefully decode the full packet; but as long as we only print the fixed-length header (and don't attempt to read more based on lengths in the header) it could be useful to print the 24B we /do/ have to determine the cause of the problem. 

Perhaps make the error message more explicit that the magic is bad and hence we cannot trust the test of the packet; or maybe print the whole 24B we do have as part of the "bad magic" message?

It is in the audit log if you really want to see these (in the audit log you may enable disable that specific entry if one cares about it or not)

True, but that's another (different) logfile I'd have to look at - and in fact auditing might not be enabled.

Essentially I think the main user of this information is us developers (we wouldn't expect in a production system to see many invalid packets).
