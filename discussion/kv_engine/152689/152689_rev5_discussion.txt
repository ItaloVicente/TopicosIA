DESCRIPTION:

Remove ActiveStream::shouldProcessItem

ActiveStream::shouldProcessItem is logically

    Item::shouldReplicate && sysevent-check

Given that sysevent-check is a tautology, just make the call to
Item::shouldReplicate.

Line:1319, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> iirc the intent here was if we have system events which don't replicate (which we don't yet have)

Line:1319, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Sure, I'm obviously happy to step back if you want to leave this as a placeholder - but we can just re-introduce it back when/if necessary

Line:1319, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> I think there's no harm in leaving this code as-is - it captures the semantic difference that only certain system events should be replicated. It doesn't really complicate or slow down the code (IMHO).

Line:1319, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> No problem, I'll keep the condition, I'll just move it into Item::shouldReplicate as that seems the natural place for it and that allows to remove a useless function.

But I'm surprised on the approach on this particular case, as we have a number of enums everywhere and obviously we don't spread switch-cases(s) around just because we may need that in the future. Maybe I miss something, is there already a plan to introduce further SysEvent types that aren't being replicated over DCP ?

Line:1319, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> The point is more that _if_ we added a SyncWrite tomorrow, it wouldn't replicate by default (and in fact you'd get a compile warning about an uncovered switch here). If you made your change that would no longer be the case.

Think of this function as a slightly more verbose version of just calling shouldReplicate _currently_ - the compiler will optimise all the "true"  away, but to the reader there's a clear intent on _why_ we choose to replicate some stuff but not others.
