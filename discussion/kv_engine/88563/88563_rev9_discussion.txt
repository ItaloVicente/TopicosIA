DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: Add configuration parameter to select HT eviction policy

With the plan to add a new hash table eviction policy, we want the
ability to switch between running with the original policy that uses
2-bit LRUs, and the new policy which uses 8-bit statistical counters.

Therefore a configuration option is added.

Line:134, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> Style: For fully-covered switch statements; prefer to /not/ include a default: case; and instead add an appropriate check at the end that one of the cases was hit. For example in this case copy the `return true` into each case.

This allows the compiler to warn if we later add a new case and it isn't covered in the switch. See https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#don-t-use-default-labels-in-fully-covered-switches-over-enumerations
