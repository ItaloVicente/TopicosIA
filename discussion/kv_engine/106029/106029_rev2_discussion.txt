DESCRIPTION:

MB-33276 [SR]: Never leave iterators invalid at SyncWrite removal

DurabilityMonitor::removeSyncWrite could make ReplicatinChain's
itrerators invalid. Details follow.

The following scenario may happens when multiple clients issue durable
writes with mixed Majority and PersistToMajority concerns (example with
1-replica, majority=2):

Caption:
sX(L) -> seqno X, Level L [M]ajority / [P]ersistToMajority
N(T) -> node N, Tracking for [m]emory / [d]isk

1) s1(P) and s2(M) added for tracking into the DurabilityMonitor

End        s1(P)        s2(M)
^^
A(m)/A(d)
^^
R(m)/R(d)

2) both Active and Replica ack memSeqno:2

End        s1(P)        s2(M)
^                       ^
A(d)                    A(m)
^                       ^
R(d)                    R(m)

3) s2(M) is satisfied, committed and removed from tracking; iterators
A(m) and R(m) are repositioned to 'prev' (i.e., s1(P))

End        s1(P)        x
^          ^
A(d)       A(m)
^          ^
R(d)       R(m)

4) both Active and Replica ack diskSeqno:1

End        s1(P)        x
           ^^
           A(m)/A(d)
           ^^
           R(m)/R(d)

5) s1(P) is satisfied, committed and removed from tracking; /all/
iterators should be repositined to 'prev' (i.e., End), but actually A(m)
and R(m) are invalidated: 

End        x        x
^          ^
A(d)       A(m)
^          ^
R(d)       R(m)

At this point any call to DurabilityMonitor::addSyncWrite could lead to
crash caused by actions on A(m) (dereferencing/moving/etc..).

The root cause of this issue is that at step (5) we reposition only
iterators that satisfy the (lastWriteSeqno == removeSeqno) condition.
While the condition is satisfied for A(d) and R(d), it is not for A(m)
and R(m) as their lastWriteSeqno is 2 (that is because they originally
pointed to s2; note that lastWriteSeqno is the "highest SyncWrite seqno
pointed by a ReplicationChain iterator").
