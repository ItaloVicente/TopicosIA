DESCRIPTION:

MB-33276 [SR]: Never leave iterators invalid at SyncWrite removal

DurabilityMonitor::removeSyncWrite could make ReplicatinChain's
itrerators invalid. Details follow.

The following scenario may happens when multiple clients issue durable
writes with mixed Majority and PersistToMajority concerns (example with
1-replica, majority=2):

Caption:
sX(L) -> seqno X, Level L [M]ajority / [P]ersistToMajority
N(T) -> node N, Tracking for [m]emory / [d]isk

1) s1(P) and s2(M) added for tracking into the DurabilityMonitor

End        s1(P)        s2(M)
^^
A(m)/A(d)
^^
R(m)/R(d)

2) both Active and Replica ack memSeqno:2

End        s1(P)        s2(M)
^                       ^
A(d)                    A(m)
^                       ^
R(d)                    R(m)

3) s2(M) is satisfied, committed and removed from tracking; iterators
A(m) and R(m) are repositioned to 'prev' (i.e., s1(P))

End        s1(P)        x
^          ^
A(d)       A(m)
^          ^
R(d)       R(m)

4) both Active and Replica ack diskSeqno:1

End        s1(P)        x
           ^^
           A(m)/A(d)
           ^^
           R(m)/R(d)

5) s1(P) is satisfied, committed and removed from tracking; /all/
iterators should be repositined to 'prev' (i.e., End), but actually A(m)
and R(m) are invalidated:

End        x        x
^          ^
A(d)       A(m)
^          ^
R(d)       R(m)

At this point any call to DurabilityMonitor::addSyncWrite could lead to
crash caused by actions on A(m) (dereferencing/moving/etc..).
Note that dereferencing/moving and invalid iterator is undefined
behaviour, so the way we crash is not deterministic.

The root cause of this issue is that at step (5) we reposition only
iterators that satisfy the (lastWriteSeqno == removeSeqno) condition.
While the condition is satisfied for A(d) and R(d), it is not for A(m)
and R(m) as their lastWriteSeqno is 2 (that is because they originally
pointed to s2; note that lastWriteSeqno is the "highest SyncWrite seqno
pointed by a ReplicationChain iterator").

Note that the scenario described above is what we call Out-of-Order
Commit. Fixed here but already planned for removing as it breaks the
Sync Replication consistency model.
