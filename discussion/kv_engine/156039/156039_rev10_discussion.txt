DESCRIPTION:

MB-47092: Separate engine stats into high/low cardinality

Previously, all engine stats in the empty-key/"all" were exposed in the
low cardinality stat group as they are per-bucket.

As the number of KV metrics is quite high, the space used to retain all
KV metrics for a reasonable length of time is unacceptable.

As a step towards improving this, split engine stats into high/low
cardinality. This does not affect cbstats, but will move less critical
stats to the high cardinality endpoint, where they will be gathered
less frequently.

Stats which are now in the high cardinality endpoint:

* all config-derived metrics

* subset of engine stats:

    kv_ep_storage_age_seconds
    kv_ep_storage_age_highwat_seconds
    kv_ep_num_workers
    kv_ep_vbucket_del_max_walltime_seconds
    kv_ep_vbucket_del_avg_walltime_seconds
    kv_ep_num_access_scanner_runs
    kv_ep_num_access_scanner_skips
    kv_ep_access_scanner_last_runtime_seconds
    kv_ep_access_scanner_num_items
    kv_ep_defragmenter_num_visited
    kv_ep_defragmenter_num_moved
    kv_ep_defragmenter_sv_num_moved
    kv_ep_item_compressor_num_visited
    kv_ep_item_compressor_num_compressed
    kv_ep_cursor_dropping_lower_threshold_bytes
    kv_ep_cursors_dropped
    kv_ep_cursor_memory_freed_bytes

This change decreased the disk used by Prometheus on an idle node
with a single bucket after ~40h uptime by ~27% (18MB->13MB).

Patch looks good so far. Suggestions for some other stuff to check, but that can be a second patch.
Line:2955, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Possibly into diminishing returns here, but I'll point out a few which I think we can still move from low to high. If you want to do these as a follow-up that's fine (as I assume we need to verify UI etc isn't affected):

Line:2958, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> This is set at bucket creation time an I don't believe can be changed later, so little-to-no value in being in low card.

Line:3003, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Watermarks rarely change (are derived from Bucket Quota). If UI doesn't need these I think we can move both low and high.

Line:3016, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> I note these has the value value as ep_blob_overhead - is there a bug here (and we should be calling a different stats method)?

If not, then we don't need a duplicated stat and could remove one of them.

Line:3026, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> This is basically a constant and can be in high.

Line:3059, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Given we already have this in histogram format, wonder if it's actually worth having this in individual stats form in low card set?

Can you check if prometheus has the histogram for this?

Line:3070, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Given we only run access scanner once per day by default (and few people change it), can probably move this to high.

Line:3079, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Similary for these; we don't really need to record the details of when it next runs every 10s

Line:3102, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> This is basically a constant, can be moved to high.

Line:2958, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Ah, this isn't actually even exposed to Prometheus as it's not numeric... will move to high card and make a note that we might want a numeric equivalent.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:3003, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> UI doesn't use the ..._percent watermark stats, so they're actually kinda redundant. Will move for now, and make a note to potentially remove from Prometheus.

Line:3016, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Archeology suggests it's been a dupe for a long time... Will remove in a dedicated patch just in case it sets something on fire.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:3059, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Histogram is there, but doesn't have an accurate number for the max because of the buckets. Doesn't appear in the list of UI/ns_server stats, so I'll move to high. I'm also not a big fan of it being conditional, but will change that separately.

Line:3070, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Woops. This is already in high, and shouldn't be here.

Line:3079, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> same as the priority, this is not present in Prometheus as it is a string
