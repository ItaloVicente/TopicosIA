DESCRIPTION:

MB-47092: Separate engine stats into high/low cardinality

Previously, all engine stats in the empty-key/"all" were exposed in the
low cardinality stat group as they are per-bucket.

As the number of KV metrics is quite high, the space used to retain all
KV metrics for a reasonable length of time is unacceptable.

As a step towards improving this, split engine stats into high/low
cardinality. This does not affect cbstats, but will move less critical
stats to the high cardinality endpoint, where they will be gathered
less frequently.
