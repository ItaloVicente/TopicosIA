DESCRIPTION:

MB-36735: EP Replica resilient to unprepared Abort

So far, at PDM we never expect to end-up with processing the completion
of a tracked Prepare twice. But, there is a case where that may happen:
1) Replica is receiving an unprepared Abort, and..
2) The unprepared Abort is within a disk-snapshot, and..
3) The already-completed Prepare is Level::PersistToMajority, and..
4) The flusher has not yet persisted the entire snapshot containing the
  Prepare, which means that the HPS has never reached the Prepare

If that happens, then the completed Prepare is still tracked in PDM when
the unprepared Abort is processed.

The above is perfectly legal, so Replica must be resilient to that
scenario.

(4 comments)

just some comment things and clarification on your comments about flushing entire snapshots
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> 2 has to be the case for 1 to happen (validly)

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> technically only needs to persist the prepare as it could come from a memory snapshot

Line:403, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> same comments as commit message

Line:165, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.h -> same comment as commit message, I don't think we need to persist the entire snapshot, just the prepare as it's not a disk snapshot. Maybe I'm mistaken though. If not, please update comments and maybe the persistence seqno in test

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Sure, swapping or merging the 2 points to clarify

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Commit message not good, I'll fix/expand.

Full example (I'll include it in the commit message):

    a) SnapMarker(1, 2, Memory)
    b) PRE(1, Level=PersistToMajority)
    c) SnapMarker(3, 3, Memory)
    d) ABORT(3)
    e) <something happens so that Replica receives a disk snapshot>
    f) SnapMarker(4, 5, Disk)
    g) ABORT(5)

> The flusher has not persisted the entire snapshot that contains the Prepare

That refers to "a) SnapMarker(1, 2, Memory)".
A PersistTo prepare is locally-satisfied only when the flusher has persisted the entire snapshot that contains the prepare, regardless of snapshot-type.

This commit message is poor and requires a general refactoring ;)

Line:165, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.h -> > I don't think we need to persist the entire snapshot

Actually we do for Level::PersistToMajority, see comments in PassiveDurabilityMonitor::State::updateHighPreparedSeqno().
