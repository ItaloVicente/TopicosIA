DESCRIPTION:

MB-36735: EP Replica resilient to unprepared Abort

So far, at PDM we never expect to end-up with processing the completion
of a Prepare twice. But, there is a case where that may happen:
1) Replica is receiving an unprepared Abort, and..
2) The unprepared Abort is within a disk-snapshot, and..
3) The already-completed Prepare is Level::PersistToMajority, and..
4) The flusher has not yet persisted the entire snapshot containing the
  Prepare, which means that the HPS has never reached the Prepare

The above is perfectly legal, so Replica must be resilient to that
scenario.
