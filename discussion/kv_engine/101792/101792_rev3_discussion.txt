Line:129, include/mcbp/protocol/framebuilder.h -> Prefer the C++ std::copy_backward (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/copy_backward)

Line:162, include/mcbp/protocol/framebuilder.h -> These three chunks of code are very similar - only difference is the start position / size. Would remove duplication if you created a helper function which all three could use.

Line:154, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> If you made this class inherit from Header these would be simplified - or are you already planning something similar in a later patch?

Line:129, include/mcbp/protocol/framebuilder.h -> This is one place the C++ standard should have a function which works exactly as memmove (a wrapper on top of std::copy or std::copy_backwards). I don't want to clutter the code with the extra logic to check if I need to use std::copy or std::copy_backwards depending if I'm going to move the data forward or backwards in memory. 

memmove is part of the C standard so I don't see anything wrong in using that as it won't go away anyway soon ;-)

Line:162, include/mcbp/protocol/framebuilder.h -> will do

Line:154, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> If I inherit from another class the size of the class change as it'll get the virtual function table.

The primary use of the class "all over the place" is that we'll cast the memory area to either a request / response depending on what it is.. "some time in the future" I could make this a template as the "only thing which differ" on these classes the name of the "vbucket/status" field. (that's currently not a plan... there is way too much stuff which needs to be fixed first)

Line:129, include/mcbp/protocol/framebuilder.h -> Hm, I was thinking we always knew the direction but I guess not...

Line:154, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> Only if you have any virtual methods. If you don't then it's just simple composition and you avoid having to manually write these forwarding methods.

Line:154, include/mcbp/protocol/request.h -> Ok.. I'll consider that once I've moved everyone over to use the getter/setter (as it the members have different names in the various structs now)
