DESCRIPTION:

MB-53053: Make ItemPager inherit from NotifiableTask

Also had to add NotifiableTask::wasNotifiedManually.

The ItemPager task exposes no other behaviour other than that it can be
woken up and that wakeup being debounced.

By inheriting from NotifiableTask, we remove the duplicated debouncing
code and we can now refer to this task by a `NotifiableTask*`. This
will allow us to define a cross-bucket ItemPager task in the future
and refer to it by the same pointer type.
