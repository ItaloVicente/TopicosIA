DESCRIPTION:

MB-25344: Ignore logically deleted keys for certain ops

This change has some similarities to the way in which we deal with
expired keys. Because deletion of collection data is lazy, similarly
expired items, it can happen that certain operations have unexpected
outcomes because they find an existing key in the hash-table, however
that key is deleted and should not affect the operation. Consider the
case of ADD, ADD must only succeed if the database does not already
have the key being added, in terms of collections ADD may find a
logically deleted key and incorrectly fail.

This change now passes the VB collections manifest down the operation
path so that when we do a HT lookup we can do an isLogicallyDeleted
check against the StoredValue and correct the faulty operation to work
as if no key was found.

In this level of the patch we are doing two collections map lookups
on the incoming operation because we first do the 'is key valid' test
then later check the StoredValue. A CachingReadHandle is planned which
performs one lookup in collections map and then keeps that metadata
handle for the subsequent isLogicallyDeleted checks.
