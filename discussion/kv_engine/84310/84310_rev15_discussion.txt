DESCRIPTION:

MB-25344: [1/n] Ignore logically deleted keys for ADD

The semantics of ADD mean that it should only succeed if the key does
not already exist. With collection deletion, the removal of keys is
'lazy', similar to expiry, thus it's possible for ADD to find a key
in the hash-table, which it can overwrite when it's logically deleted
or expired.

This change passes a CachingReadHandle down the ADD path (we already
had read access held on collections for the entire operation, so lock
scope is not changed here). Within the depths of ADD we can now
safely ignore logically deleted keys.
