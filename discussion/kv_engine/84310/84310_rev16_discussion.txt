DESCRIPTION:

MB-25344: [1/n] Ignore logically deleted keys for ADD

The semantics of ADD mean that it should only succeed if the key does
not already exist. With collection deletion, the removal of keys is
'lazy', similar to expiry, thus it's possible for ADD to find a key
in the hash-table, which it can overwrite when it's logically deleted
or expired.

This change passes a CachingReadHandle down the ADD path (we already
had read access held on collections for the entire operation, so lock
scope is not changed here). Within the depths of ADD we can now
safely ignore logically deleted keys.

Line:2220, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Can we remove this clause now - does isLogicalyDeleted() cover it?

Line:2220, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> StoredValue::isDeleted would relate to the key being deleted by a client issuing delete (or any path calling HashTable::unlocked_softDelete), so not covered by the key becoming deleted as part of its collection being removed

Line:2220, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Ah ok - I think I must have misread the code somewhere as I thought isLogicallyDeleted() also checked (user) deletion.
