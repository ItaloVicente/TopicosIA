DESCRIPTION:

MB-36971: Ensure that DCP Producer handles KeyEnoent correctly

Ensure that the DCP Producer disconnects when it receives a KeyEnoent
from a DCP consumer in response to a DcpPrepare, DcpCommit or DcpAbort.
As currently we swallow this error for these opcodes, which causes us to
hang in rebalance when the consumer has received a DcpCommit or
DcpAbort for a key it dose not have a prepare for. Disconnecting from
the consumer gives use the opportunity to re-connect and resolve the bad
state on the consumer.

We should also never see a KeyEnoent from a consumer in response to a
DcpPrepare. As when processing a prepare in KVBucket::prepare() we
always pass a 0 cas to VBucket::prepare() which will remap
MutationStatus::NotFound to ENGINE_KEY_ENOENT but the only cases where
processSet() and processSetInner() return NotFound are cases where a non
zero cas has been specified.

Also update a unit test to ensure we handle KeyEnoent and expand other
unit tests to make sure we handle Etmpfail and Enomem correctly.

Line:1138, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> We appear to have still lost this clause - if the opcode wasn't one of the above listed Dcp opcodes then we should print a log message.

Please see line 1113 of the new code line

Line:1138, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> > We appear to have still lost this clause - if the opcode wasn't one
 > of the above listed Dcp opcodes then we should print a log message.

We would still log this message prepare, commit and abort on lines 1141 to 1150. If it didn't meet any of the opcodes specified then it would fall through to the bottom of the function log then disconnect lines 1158 to 1160.

Line:1117, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> @Paolo
