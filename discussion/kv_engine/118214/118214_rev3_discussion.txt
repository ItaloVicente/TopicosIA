DESCRIPTION:

MB-36971: Ensure that DCP Producer handles KeyEnoent correctly

Ensure that the DCP Producer disconnects when it receives a KeyEnoent
from a DCP consumer in response to a DcpCommit or DcpAbort. As
currently we swallow this error for these opcodes, which causes us to
hang in rebalance when the consumer has received a DcpCommit or
DcpAbort for a key it dose not have a prepare for. Disconnecting from
the consumer gives use the opportunity to re-connect and resolve the bad
state on the consumer.

Also add a unit test to ensure we handle KeyEnoent and expand other unit
tests to make sure we handle Etmpfail and Enomem correctly.

In particular, why KeyNoent+DcpPrepare is expected?

Line:1122, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Different behaviour for DcpAbort + KeyEnoent:
before: log + return true
after: log + return false

I have not checked all the possibilities, but in general at this stage we should make the minimal change (ie, change what necessary for this fix and leave all the rest as it is)

With regards to DcpPrepare, I don't see any valid path that we should return this error code. Thus, I might be wise to expand this return false for DcpPrepare too. With regards to the code comment KeyNoent is only ever expected from DcpStreamEnd. Thus this code comment should be move and clarified.

Line:1122, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> RE second comment. For abort we would only expect to see KeyEnoent when there isn't a valid stream or that the opace between stream and packet mismatch. Thus, I believe that the connection would be in a bad state and we should tear down the connection (as per my commit message)

Further to this, when reading VBucket::processSetInner() you may see that there are two locations where we return MutationStatus::NotFound which is remapped to ENGINE_KEY_ENOENT in VBucket::prepare(). However, becouse we all ways set the cas to 0 at http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/mad-hatter/kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc#1697 we should always have a cas value of 0 in VBucket::processSetInner() thus we would never expect it to return MutationStatus::NotFound. So we should never expect to see KeyNoent as a response from a replica to a producer.
