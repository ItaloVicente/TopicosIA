DESCRIPTION:

MB-43028: Reset memOverheadChangedCallback before VBucket destruction

Merging http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/136495 into master
uncovered a heap-use-after-free (mad-hatter ASan runs an older Clang).

This patch resolves the issue, _before_ the above patch is merged to
master.

During VBucket destruction, the CheckpointManager member, and any
remaining Checkpoints it holds are destroyed. This can trigger the
memOverheadChangedCallback, as destroying Checkpoints reduces the
memory overhead.

It is not safe to allow the memOverheadChangedCallback to read the
vbucket state, as the state member has already been destroyed as it is
declared later in VBucket. Rather than re-ordering VBucket and
potentially introducing new ordering issues, reset the callback before
VBucket members are destroyed.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think re-ordering is the correct solution here - if in Checkpoint(Manger) conceptually depends on the state variable, then state should be before Checkpoint(Manager) in VBucket class.
