DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Unify cursor registration methods

Two CheckpointManager functions exist for registering a cursor

* registerCursor
* registerCursorBySeqno

All DCP cursors use registerCursorBySeqno, only test code user
registerCursor directly whereas some internal code use
registerCursor_UNLOCKED for persistence cursor registration and during
vbucket reset to move cursors from an old VB to the new.

Removing registerCursor and having all users use registerCursorBySeqno
reduces the amount of registration code we have to maintain.

The internal code registering persistence and old cursors now uses
registerCursorBySeqno and the lastBySeqno of the manager

* persistence is registered in construction so lastBySeqno is the
  earliest available item and logically the same as the code being
  replaced

* resetCursors is called from a new checkpoint manager and thus the
  same justification as the persistence cursor change. Note a
  subsequent cursor re-factor is changing how we "steal" cursors in
  the reset path.
