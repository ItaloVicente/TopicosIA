DESCRIPTION:

MB-30019: Always close replica-checkpoint on memory-snapshot-end

Currently, when a Consumer receives the shapshot-end mutation of a
memory-snapshot we close the current open checkpoint only if
(mem_used > high_watermark).
As seen in MB-30019, we may end up with keeping big checkpoints in
memory when a Consumer has received the latest snapshot.
We this patch we unconditionally close a open replica-checkpoint when
the Consumer receives the snapshot-end mutation for a memory-sanpshot.

Line:1250, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Why are you taking a reference to a pointer type? Probably clearer if you make this 

 auto* checkpointManager = vb->checkpointManager.get();

Also - if you're trying to make the code more compact (by using "checkpointManager" instead of "vb->checkpointManager" you've only reduced 22 chars to 18. Personaly if you're going to add an alias like this I'd make it signicnantly shorter - ckptMgr or similar.

Line:1279, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Can this be const?

Line:1304, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> I don't see why this is allocated on the heap - can we simply it and just allocate locally?

Line:1330, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> As above - can we just alloc on stack?

Line:1340, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Probably also worth checking the state of each checkpoint (closed/open) is as expected.

Line:67, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.h -> ?
