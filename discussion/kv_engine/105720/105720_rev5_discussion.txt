DESCRIPTION:

MB-33242 [SR]: Update KVStore::scan() to use DiskDocKey

Update KVStore::scan and related types to use DiskDocKey instead of
DocKey.

Note that because the HashTable's StoredValure object don't record the
durability requirements (level), then the CacheCallback cannot be used
to fulfill a scan() for Prepared SyncWrites - they must always come
from disk.

This isn't expected to be a significant performance issue given that
pending SyncWrites should only be held in memory very briefly anyway,
so there's limited value in trying to fetch from memory.

Includes unit test for DCP backfill of prepared SyncWrites from disk.
