DESCRIPTION:

StoredValue: Convert bits2 to plain bitfield

StoredValue::bits2 was initially added as a folly::AtomicBitSet,
however this is unnecessary as the current members of it are always
modified under the HashBucketLock. Additionally a forthcoming patch
needs to change the 'committed' field from one to two bits. Given
AtomicBitSet doesn't allow more than 1 bit to be read / written at
once (so we'd be adding two atomic operations), change the type of
bits2 to a plain bitfield given the extra functionality (and cost) of
AtomicBitSet isn't needed.
