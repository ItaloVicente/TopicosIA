DESCRIPTION:

MB-38741: Reduce item pager sleep time from 3600s to 600s

The frequency at which the expiry pager runs can be set using a
configuration parameter exp_pager_stime. It has a default of 3600s,
which means it is configured to run once an hour.

The default has been unchanged since at least version 2.5.1.

There have been customer issues (see linked CBSEs) where expiry has
impacted front-end operations. Additionally, the ExpiryPager no longer
holds HashTable locks for extended periods (as it originally) did, so
running it more frequently shouldn't be a problem now.

Reducing the interval from 1 hour to 10 mins.
