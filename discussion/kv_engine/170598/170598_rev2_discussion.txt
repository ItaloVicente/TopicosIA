DESCRIPTION:

MB-50747: TOY-BUILD

Compaction may skip dropped collection item count updates

MagmaKVStore drops collections in the implicit compaction as follows.

1. Compact and find all tables storing prepares
2. Iterate through the list of dropped collections
2.1 Compact and find all tables storing keys of that collection

During 2.1 the item count of that collection was decremented from the
vbucket total.

However a bug exists in that steps 1 and 2.1 will attempt to purge all
keys from the found table(s), this means 1 or 2.1 could also fully
purge a collection that we've yet to reach in step 2.

When this happens, the item count of that collection doesn't get
decremented from the total, and the vbucket item count now shows more
items than it stores.

To fix add an optional collection-ID to the compaction context. When
this optional stores a value, the compactionCore will only drop keys
of that collection.

Secondly move the prepare namespace purge to the last namespace
compacted so that it doesn't encounter keys from dropped collections
other than any remaining prepares not dropped.

MB-50747: "logical-insert" of a tombstone leads to negative item count

Adding range checks on the item count detected that one unit test was
producing a negative item count when the backend is magma.

The following sequence of operations occurs.

seq:operation => expected item count

1:create collection c1 =>          1
2:insert key1 into c1 =>           2

flush

3:drop collection c1 =>            1
4:create collection c1 =>          2
5:insert a deleted key1 into c1 => 2
6:drop collection c1 =>            1
flush

Prior to this fix after this sequence when compaction runs the
final item count became -1

This occurs because seq:5 was treated as a plain delete and set
the magma `docCount` for that flush as -2 (ninserts:0 + ndeletes:2).
I.e. drop collection was -1 and the delete was -1.

The compaction then took the item count of 1 and subtracted -2.

The fix here skips the ndeletes count for the store at seq:5, the
'logically inserted tombstone' should have no affect on the item
count.
