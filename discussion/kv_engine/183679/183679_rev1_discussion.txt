DESCRIPTION:

MB-54700: Reduce the size of SVs by 2 bytes and OSVs by 8

By packing 2 bytes from the 6-byte revSeqno integer into the unused tag
of chain_next_or_replacement, the size of StoredValues is reduced by 2
bytes.

This in effect reduces the size of OSVs by 8 bytes, because the compiler
no longer needs to add 6 bytes of padding in that type to ensure its
members are aligned.
