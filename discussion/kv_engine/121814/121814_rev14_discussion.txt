MB-37774: Add per-collection memory usage stat

Extend existing statistics to track per collection memory usage of
stored values.

Stat tracking is explicitly started and stopped when collections are
added and dropped.

Line:862, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Not sure that I like this approach - RFC?

Could have the map element created on first stat update, and removed in dropKeys when memUsed for a collection hits zero, but this just seems more explicit.

Also thinking ahead to adding more collection stats, having a definite start and end might be more convenient vs relying on memUsed inside dropKey.

Though, an explicit start and end but determined somewhere other than here might be more logical

Line:257, engines/ep/src/collections/manager.cc -> this seems like a change of behaviour any reason why?

Line:1801, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> nit:not the most useful name, what does the pair contain?

Line:257, engines/ep/src/collections/manager.cc -> Dave pointed out in an earlier patch that the result was always true; X || true == true

So yeah, this is technically a change in behaviour. Can break out into a seperate patch?

Line:1801, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I was unsure about this too (looking forward to structured bindings) but I thought the following two lines would be sufficient. It is only referred to in those lines.

Could name this e.g., cidAndMemUsed or replace it with a tie and move the variable declarations out of the for loop (or other solution). Whatever is preferred :shrug:
