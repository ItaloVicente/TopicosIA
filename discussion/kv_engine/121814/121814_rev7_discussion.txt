From my reading AtomicHashMap _does_ reclaim the slot in the map when an item is removed (it just doesn't free the memory), so as long as we only allow some reasonable number of concurrent collections (10,000?) then that should be fine - i.e we will at most use 10000 * sizeof(uint64_t) = 80KB (plus overhead) for the maximum number of collections.
