DESCRIPTION:

MB-35979: Ensure SyncWrites check expiry of committed item

Writes respond differently if the existing item is logically
non-existent (e.g., expired) when a cas is provided.

In addition, if an item expires it should not be treated as locked.

Prior to this patch, both of these checks checked the expiry of the
stored value which is about to be modified. However, in an ephemeral
bucket, this stored value may be a completed prepare - the expiry of
the prepare is not necessarily related to the expiry of the committed
item.

This patch ensures the expiry of the committed item is always checked
when available/necessary.
