DESCRIPTION:

MB-41165: Track prepares against collection disk size

Prepares could be a substantial amount of the disk size that
contributes towards a collection as they are kept around until
compaction runs. To provide a more accurate collection size to
customers we should include the prepare sizes in the collection disk
size.
