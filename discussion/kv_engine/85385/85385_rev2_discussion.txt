DESCRIPTION:

MB-26705: Make ItemPager's wake mechanism more reliable

The current mechanism which evaluates the task state is
racey and could lead to loss of a wakeup. It can happen
that the observer reads the state and see RUNNING but
the task is about to call snooze, thus the observer
will not wake the task.

This patch uses the atomic notify flag similar to DCP
checkpoint processor.

The approach looks good at a high level; just a question about exactly where we put the wakups - this stuff it tricky at the best of times, we should probably be consistent between the different tasks.
Line:333, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> Note in http://review.couchbase.org/83039 I removed the second wakeup at the end to simplify things - I *believe* if anyone else woke this task while it was running then it should be correct to just skip this and return true here, and it will be scheduled as appropriate.

(If I'm wrong and we do need / want this for perf reasons, we should probably do the same with the bgfetcher so they are consistent).

I need to re-evaluate this branch, as mentioned this morning we may result in scheduling many PagingVisitors as the ItemPager isn't the task doing the bulk of the work... will review the trigger mech as part of this

Line:333, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> Hmm I think in this task you're right - in  ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask::run we need it because there's a second condition which should trigger 'wakeUp' (!queueEmpty) in this task, there is no second condition. Although even ActiveStream doens't need the second cmpxchg
