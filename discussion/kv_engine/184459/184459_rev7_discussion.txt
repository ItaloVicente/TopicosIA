DESCRIPTION:

MB-54958: Move the protocol bits of Observe to the core

Separate out the bits for the protocol encoding from ep-engine
and perform that in the core.

Given that the core supports a state machinery for the command
we don't need to redo all keys every time we have to block for
a key; and may continue to the next key.

@todo move the constants from protocol_binary.h to somewhere
else and add remap in the core.
