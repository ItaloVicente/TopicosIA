DESCRIPTION:

MB-40531: WIP Prefer paging from replicas if possible

Prior to this change, the pager would try to page out X% of items in
replica vbuckets, but if this did not bring memory usage below the low
water mark, it would flip phase to ACTIVE_AND_PENDING_ONLY - meaning
the next run of the pager would page immediately try to page from
active and pending vbuckets.

Now, replica vbuckets will always be considered first. In the event
that paging _every_ possible item from replicas would not free enough
memory to drop below the low water mark, it will then also evict from
active vbuckets.

NOTE: this does not currently account for non-evictable items like:
system events, prepares, and dirty items.  These _must_ be considered
to avoid the pager getting "stuck" and not considering active vbs when
it should, because replicas report they can evict more than they really
can.

Deletes are not evictable for ephemeral, but replicas are never evicted
from under ephemeral buckets anyway.
