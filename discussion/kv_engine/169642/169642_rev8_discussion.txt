DESCRIPTION:

MB-50598: Fix various errors in NexusKVStore scanning

Originally motivated by a segfault that we hit when we find during
a NexusKVStore scan that all of the callbacks made by the primary
have been purged from the secondary KVStore I wrote some additional
tests that pause after every item. These extra tests found various
similar errors during scanning where we fail to deal with cases
where items are below the purge seqno during a scan and we pause at
interesting points in time. In particular I observed errors where the
lastReadSeqnos of scans were different, and failures in callbacks when
we could not find items.
