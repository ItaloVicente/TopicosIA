DESCRIPTION:

MB-53053: Allow the number of paging visitors to be set dynamically

We want to be able to change this value at runtime in production.
Previously we only read the setting once when initialising the
QuotaSharingItemPager.

In constrast to the StrictQuotaItemPager, the QuotaSharingItemPager has
static lifetime. This meant that the new setting would only apply after
a process restart.
