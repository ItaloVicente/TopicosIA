DESCRIPTION:

MB-34685: Allow prepares and commits in same checkpoint

It's problematic to split prepares and commits into separate
checkpoints as a replica backfilling from disk must special case
this and create it's own checkpoints. This leads to issues such as
MB-34634.

Store an additional Prepare or Committed flag in the checkpoint
manager's keyIndex to allow prepares and commits to exist in the
same checkpoint.
