DESCRIPTION:

MB-24572: Collection aware DCP may send empty snapshots

If a DCP stream is configured with filtering enabled and the filter
results in 0 mutations, we still send snapshots to the client but
no data. In a needle/haystack situation, the client looking for
needles will get frequent traffic triggered by the haystack.

With these commit filtering is adjusted so that we filter earlier in
the DCP readyQueue creation, as data is pulled from a checkpoint we
do filtering and the existing logic for empty checkpoints kicks in to
ensure the stream doesn't get an empty snapshot sent.
