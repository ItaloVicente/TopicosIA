DESCRIPTION:

MB-24572: Stop Collection aware DCP from sending empty snapshots

If a DCP stream is configured with filtering enabled and the filter
results in 0 mutations, we still send snapshot markers to the client.
In a needle/haystack situation, the client looking for needles will
get frequent traffic (snapshot markers) triggered by the mutations
made against the haystack.

With this change, filtering is moved earlier in the stream flow, now
when we build the 'readyQueue' we apply filtering allowing the
existing empty checkpoint/snapshot logic to prevent an empty snapshot
being sent.

Patch Set 19: Code-Review-1

As discussed in person yesterday, I think we should consider if there's any consequences in eliding snapshot markers / changing the end seqno in terms of resuming a stream / rollback.

Let me know when you're happy this is ok, and I'll review it fully :)

As discussed, hopefully a reasonable summary:

A DCP snapshot isn't directly tied to a disk checkpoint (commit). A snapshot
is defined as "a series of commands that is guaranteed to contain a unique set of keys.".

So when we commit a checkpoint to disk with 10 keys, DCP may have sent 10 
snapshots each with one mutation, or something in between.

checkpoint:  0   1   2   3   4
            [a1, b1, a2, a3, b2]

snapshots:  {a1},{b1},{a2},{a3},{b2}
            {a1,b1},{a2},{a3},{b2]
            {a1,b1},{a2},{a3,b2}
            ...

So with this commit, filtering before we build the snapshot the snapshot still
has the same meaning, a unique set of keys.

filtering for a:
checkpoint:  0   1   2   3   4
            [a1, b1, a2, a3, b2]

snapshots:  {a1},{a2},{a3}
            {a1},{a2,a3}
            {a1,a2},{a3}

With respect to client rollback, dropping snapshots may just mean that a filtered client
forces our DcpProducer to backfill further. 

filtering for a:
checkpoint:  0   1   2   3   4    5   6
            [a1, b1, a2, a3, b2] [b2, b3]
            
snapshots:  {a1},{a2},{a3}
            
client never receives 5 and 6 so will always resume from 3 possibly forcing them to rollback to 0 and us to backfill from 0.
An unfiltered client who received seqno 4 should be able to resume  from 4 (I think).


In-terms of our rollback, we never use filtering on our replicas.

Great, thanks for summarising - much clearer :)

Couple of minor things / questions.
File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> What do you think about including your nice examples / diagrams in the commit message itself?
Line:136, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_filter.cc -> If the switch is totally covered, would be preferable to keep the previous behaviour (remove the `default`) so we get a compiler warning if we add new enum values in future.

Line:55, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_filter.h -> Nit: Maybe include "error"  /  "exception" / "invalid" or something similar in the name to make it clearer from the name this is an exception?
