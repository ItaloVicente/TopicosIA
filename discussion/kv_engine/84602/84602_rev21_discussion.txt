DESCRIPTION:

MB-24572: Stop Collection aware DCP from sending empty snapshots

If a DCP stream is configured with filtering enabled and the filter
results in 0 mutations, we still send snapshot markers to the client.

"Hey here's 500 to 510" ... silence

In a needle/haystack situation, the client looking for needles will
get frequent snapshot markers triggered by the mutations made against
the haystack, it is preferential that the needle client gets nothing
until the needle collection is touched.

To recap on snapshots - a DCP snapshot is "a series of commands that
is guaranteed to contain a unique set of keys.", it isn't necessarily
representative of a disk checkpoint (commit).

Prior to this commit we may then do the following:

checkpoint:  0   1   2   3   4
            [a1, b1, a2, b2, b3]

some example snapshot possibilities {start, end, commands}

unfiltered:

  {0, 0, a1}, {1, 1, b1}, {2, 2, a2}, {3, 3, b2}, {4, 4, b3}
  {0, 1, a1,b1}, {2, 2, a2}, {3, 3, b2}, {4, 4, b3}
  {0, 1, a1,b1}, {2, 2, a2}, {3, 4, b2,b3}

filtered-a:

  {0, 0, a1}, {1, 1, }, {2, 2, a2}, {3, 3, a3}, {4, 4, }
  {0, 1, a1}, {2, 2, a2}, {3, 3, a3}, {4, 4, }
  {0, 1, a1}, {2, 2, a2}, {3, 4, a3}

As shown some of the possible filtered permutations DCP may send

1. We send empty snapshots, a marker with no commands
2. We send partial snapshots e.g. {3, 4, a3} tells the client about
 an end of 4, but never sent command 4 (which unfiltered does). A
 client may expect 4 to trigger something...

With this change, filtering is moved earlier in the stream flow, now
when we build the 'readyQueue' we apply filtering allowing the
existing empty checkpoint/snapshot logic to prevent an empty snapshot
being sent and ensures correct start/end seqnos.

The examples now...

filtered-a:

  {0, 0, a1}, {2, 2, a2}, {3, 3, a3}
  {0, 0, a1}, {2, 2, a2}, {3, 3, a3}
  {0, 0, a1}, {2, 2, a2}, {3, 3, a3}

The update shows no empty snapshots and correct start/end.
