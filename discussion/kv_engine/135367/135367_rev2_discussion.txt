DESCRIPTION:

MB-41095: Use testPrivilege when checking DCP stream privileges

When re-evaluating DCP privileges we must not use checkPrivilege,
because on failure that function assumes it is being called from
the context of a incoming command, and will fail (as seen in the
MB) with an exception.

Using testPrivilege is much simpler and doesn't call functions
which may throw from this context.
