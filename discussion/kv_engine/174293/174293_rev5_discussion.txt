DESCRIPTION:

MB-51877: Let SCUGT::tick rollover overuse

The way we're planning to use the Gauge is to just check if
there is any room available before starting to execute an
operation, and once the operation completes we'll account for
the data being used.

A problem with the previous implementation was that you could
overuse your quota a lot, and every time you entered a new time
slot you would be free to do it over again.

If you for instance set up a limit of 5k CU/s the max document
size you can operate on is 5M. There was nothing stopping you
from running a ton of parallel operations on 20MB documents
(as in the beginning of the time slot there was 5K CU available
so you could start all operations) and when all of they complete
you have used your quota for a long time, but instead you would
start with clean sheets at the next second boundary.

This patch let the over-use of the quota roll over to the next
timeslot.

Line:74, daemon/sloppy_compute_unit_gauge_test.cc -> I _think_ the atomic variable you have in tick() is correct, but I thin it would be good to validate it by having a multi-threaded test which calls increment from multiple threads and checks that the behaviour is correct when tick() in the middle of other thread(s) calling increment().

Line:74, daemon/sloppy_compute_unit_gauge_test.cc -> The Gauge is intended to be sloppy, and isn't considered to always be correct (its not even considered a problem if we loose a small fraction of the accounted value).

 For instance we move to the next slot before roll over the data from the previous slot. This means that there is a short period of time others _could_ check for the limit with an "empty" value even if the case was that we had fully used the quota for a the next slot as well. This is considered OK as its a very short window and we don't need to be 100% correct at all time (the cost of doing that outweights the benefit).

Line:74, daemon/sloppy_compute_unit_gauge_test.cc -> I understand the rationale for trying to keep the logic simpler, and that we don't "need" to account precisely a user's CUs.

However, it does make testing the code (in terms of concurrency) difficult - one cannot perform exact checks on actual values on the class given the "sloppy" nature of it.

In the short-term for prototyping the current code is probably ok, however I think it's something we might want to revisit further down the line.

However, I _do_ think we need a unit test which performs concurrent updates to the gauge (even if there's no checking of the actual values) to give TSan / Asan code to exercise the logic and to check for basic thread-safety.

Line:74, daemon/sloppy_compute_unit_gauge_test.cc -> The multithreaded nature of the code is executed on the full server build in the elixir unit test suite (where there is tests which _does_ run the increment and test from one set of threads and the tick from another thread) where it'll actually verify the result of the operations so that we don't go above the limit etc. TSAN and ASAN should be able to catch it there (added in the next changeset).

(I don't disagree that an isolated test is better, but just spin up threads to perform increment and ticks without even check for "correctness" doesn't seem like too much value apart from burning some extra CPU)
