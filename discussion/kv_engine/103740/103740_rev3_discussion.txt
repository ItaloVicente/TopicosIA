DESCRIPTION:

MB-32684 [SR]: Record setVBstate VBucket topology

Pass the new optional JSON payload for the SET_VBUCKET_STATE request
down to ep-engine's VBucket, validate it and record the specified
topology inside VBucket.

Expose the topology via a new 'topology' key in the 'vbucket-details'
stat group. For example, when injecting some dummy data:

    $ cbstats localhost:12000 -u Administrator -p asdasd vbucket-details 990 |grep topology
    vb_990:topology:                        [["ns_1@ABCDXYZ.ab1","ns_1@ABCDXYZ.cd1"],["ns_1@ABCDXYZ.ab5","ns_1@ABCDXYZ.cd6"]]

Note the topology is currently ignored by the DurabilityMonitor,
because ns_server is not yet populating this value and we have a
temporary hardcoded topology for testing. Once ns_server is sending
the topology and node name identifiers then it can be connected up and
the temporary hardcoded topology removed.

Line:387, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> witch craft

Line:444, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I forget how these will be handled! will we disconnect the caller or breakpad?

Line:444, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> If we are in the context of a front-end thread (e.g. ns_server sending us a SET_VBUCKET_STATE msg) then if not caught otherwise will catch in the connection runloop and disconnect.

If it's in the context of say a background task we'll abort (Breakpad) if not otherwise caught. 

The only case which I think might be a problem is incoming DCP - do we process incoming messages on a background task?

Line:2369, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> As we discussed, for Chunk-1, ns_server also needs vbucket-details to return the "state" information. I do not see it being returned here so checking.

Also, assuming the high_snapshot_seqno is already available in KV and adding it here is just one line change, then will it be possible to return the high_snapshot_seqno stat also in this patch? ns_server needs it for promote max replica work but if that stat is also returned by this patch, then Abhi can complete the promote max replica work as well.

Line:2369, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> The "state" was the first property reported - it's encoded as a blank stat key (see line 2329).

We don't currently record high_snapshot_seqno, so it's not available to add to stats yet. That will be done in a follow-up patch.

I suggest you use high_sqno for now given that's close enough until we get to detailed validation.
