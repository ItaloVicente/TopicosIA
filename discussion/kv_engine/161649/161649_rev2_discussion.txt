DESCRIPTION:

MB-48038: Remove broken CM::isCheckpointCreationForHighMemUsage

I remove the function rather than fixing it as checkpoint creation is
driven by checkpoint parameters that refer to the checkpoints memory
state only.

Note that the function is broken in a way that makes it always return
'false', so this patch is not really leading to any  behaviour change.

As side effect of removing the function, the 'force' arg in
CM::maybeCreateNewCheckpoint can be also removed as all callers pass
the same value.
