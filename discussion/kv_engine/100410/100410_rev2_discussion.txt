DESCRIPTION:

MB-31581: Fix missing .get() for formatting of backfillItems.sent stat

As part of the Vbid refactoring (MB-30552), many of the stats that
use vBucket ID's had .get() added to ensure that the formatting
remained consistent with before the type of Vbid was changed. One of
these stats, backfillItems.sent, was missed and thus would be
incorrect, hence the fix of adding the .get() now.
