DESCRIPTION:

MB-36956: Restructure ExecutorPoolTest/cancel_can_schedule

Change the implementation of ExecutorPoolTest/cancel_can_schedule to
not directly use CB3ExecutorThread, but instead the higher-level
ExecutorPool APIs.

This allows it to work for FollyExecutorPool in addition to
CB3ExecutorPool.
