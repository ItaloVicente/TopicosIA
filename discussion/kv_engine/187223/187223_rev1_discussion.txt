File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Just to be clear here, I don't think it's fair to say "the code never got implemented by the SDKs".  I'd very much like us to holistically take up OTel for the system and we have pretty good OTel support in the SDKs.  I think you did a great thing by prototyping this for KV.

Priorities have been elsewhere though for SDKs recently.  OpenTracing and then OTel was done by that team well before this prototype, and then they were on to other things.  

If we want to pick this back up rather than rip it out, I'd be in favor of it.  We just need to coordinate the priorities/production pipeline (which makes it sound easier than it is).

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> In the current form there is no clients which utilize the protocol definitions, we don't have support for opentracing/opentelementry within the server (no central parts for configuring etc). 

It needs to be driven as a product project covering all components. Keeping the leftovers of the prototype in there doesn't add much value and we'd be better off removing it.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> What’s the motivation to remove this? There’s a (small but non-zero) cost in removing - code review, future code changes not taking into account OpenT* considerations.

If we plan to add OpenT* support in the short-medium term; I think it makes sense to keep it in, as it will likely be less work overall for us to implement later (most of the pieces are already here). 

If we don't plan to add OpenT* in the medium term, then yes I agree we should remove it.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I want to remove the code as there are absolutely no plans of adding it (someone wants it, but it has not been driven by any PM, and it needs a PM sponsor _AND_ full commitment from all teams in order to add it). I don't want any of the existing code to bias or set limitations on how this might be planned in the future.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Given there's no immediate plan to add full OpenTelemetry support, let's take this out. 

Note we always have the patch in history, so can revert if the plans change in the short-term - it's not a vast patch.
