DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: rename CompactionConfig::db_file_id to vbid

db_file_id works very well if there is a 1-1 mapping between
a vbucket and the file it is stored on, but elsewhere in the
system we try to lock the entire vbucket based upon the
provided "db_file_id" which makes it a bit confusing for
the reader.
