DESCRIPTION:

MB-49262: Ensure expelling continues until the low mark is reached

Once checkpoint memory usage exceeds the upper mark memory recovery
methods should be triggered, and should attempt to bring checkpoint
memory to the _lower_ mark.

A bug led to memory recovery stopping once below the _upper_ mark,
meaning checkpoint memory usage often hovered near the upper mark.

Ensure recovery is _triggered_ when above upper mark, but continues
until the lower mark.
