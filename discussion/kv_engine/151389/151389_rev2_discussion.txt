So there is a race condition in there as we check an atomic variable and then go ahead trying to send more data, but at the same time the other thread may have toggled the atomic and then deleted the bucket before the first thread went ahead trying to write the data.

If it wasn't for the reason that we might have deadlocked the send if we didn't drain the read end of the same socket we could have used a single thread...
