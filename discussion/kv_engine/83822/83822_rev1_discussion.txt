DESCRIPTION:

MB-26197 [RocksDB] Add support for the Thread Pool options

RocksDB provides the `max_background_jobs`, `max_background_compactions`
and `max_background_flushes` options for tuning Multi-Thread Flush and
Compaction. With the first we just size the Thread Pool and let RocksDB
to decide how to allocate the available slots. The other two options are
deprecated but still in use in case the RocksDB default is not optimal.
For the last case we need to setup manually the HIGH Thread Pool for
Flush and the LOW Thread Pool for Compaction.

Line:94, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Shouldn't this be `defaultOptions.max_background_compactions`? I.e. you're assuming that has a value of `1`. That might well be the case today, but it could change in future.

Line:102, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> This feels over-complicated - it will be hard for users to reason about how the setting take effect!

Can't we just do what is documented at https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/RocksDB-Tuning-Guide#parallelism-options, and simply expose options for:

1. Num Low Priority background threads.
2. Num High Priority background threads.
3. max_background_compactions
4. max_background_flushes

Independently - then the user can simply tune as they wish.

Later on we might pick some sensible defaults based on our own high level bucket options - for example set all of the above to the number of shards.

Line:94, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Investigated more on this. The default size for both Thread Pools is 1, so no need to set anything in the case when one of the options is unset.

Line:102, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Changing depending on what said above. Initially over-complicated because of the wrong assumption that `env->SetBackgroundThreads()` has to be called in the case where one of the options is unset.

Line:94, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Sure, it is *today* - my point is if they change the default in a future release, we have hard-coded it to one. It's better to inherit their default directly, without a magic number.
