DESCRIPTION:

MB-45745: push OSO end-marker to readyQ with correct lock

completeOSOBackfill is calling pushToReadyQ after releasing
the streamMutex allowing for concurrent and unsafe writes
to the readyQ.

Move the push so it is in the lock scope and add some checks
to Stream.cc that the lock is held.

Line:23, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Mmm it seems that we can't do this, https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/mutex/try_lock:

> This function is allowed to fail spuriously and return false even if the mutex is not currently locked by any other thread.

And more important:

> If try_lock is called by a thread that already owns the mutex, the behavior is undefined.

Hmm it certainly caught the issue locally. Wouldn't want an accidental deadlock though

Other option is to pass the lock reference through or rename push/pop, the change will spread then as many paths have a few layers

The lock guard reference is probably the way to go; but if it's very invasive we could always defer post-7.0.
