Yep, quite invasive as there are a number of layers which are under the locked scope, defer the churn would be my preference. Looked at folly, but couldn't see if they give better guarantees about the 'try_lock' call and there was no is_locked type method we could hook into

Let's do as you suggest and get the fix in as-is. Suggest raising an MB to track the cleanup.

Curious we didn't see this via ASan - suggest we are lacking unit tests which cover this scenario?
