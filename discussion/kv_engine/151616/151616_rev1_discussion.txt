DESCRIPTION:

MB-45745: push OSO end-marker to readyQ with correct lock

completeOSOBackfill is calling pushToReadyQ after releasing
the streamMutex allowing for concurrent and unsafe writes
to the readyQ.

Move the push so it is in the lock scope and add some checks
to Stream.cc that the lock is held.
