DESCRIPTION:

MB-52566: Clear EngineSpecific if compaction request fails

Requesting compaction for a vbucket which we don't manage
will leave the EngineSpecific 'dirty'

However testing of this case doesn't reveal any problems as the
cookie is not the same between requests, so any subsequent request
and we enter the engine with null in EngineSpecific.
