DESCRIPTION:

CBSE6638 Fix NOT_STORED being returned from arithmetic operation

Currently we are returning NOT_STORED when VBucket::processAdd
returns AddStatus::Exists. This happens when the method
ArithmeticCommandContext::getItem() calling bucket_get() and
ArithmeticCommandContext::storeNewItem() calling bucket_store()
(which intern down the call stack calls VBucket::processAdd),
a value has been set for the key we are trying to perform an
arithmetic operation on.

To fix this, this patch resets the ArithmeticCommandContext
state machine by calling changing the state to Reset. When
we see ENGINE_NOT_STORED returned to
ArithmeticCommandContext::storeNewItem() by bucket_store().

This patch also adds a unit test to check that we return
ENGINE_SUCCESS and that we correctly re-try the arithmetic
operation.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Note that CBSEs are internal, and reference a particular customer investigation. Any fixes which result from them (i.e. bugs) should be tracked under a (public) MB. 

Please create an MB for this and link to the CBSE.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Note: While this is true, it's actually not relevant to this particular issue - it's deep in a particular engine (ep_engine) when the same engine-level API is used for default_engine (memcache-type buckets).

As such, I'd focus on describing the problem at the engine interface level.

Line:113, daemon/protocol/mcbp/arithmetic_context.cc -> I'm not sure this is completely correct - or at least it might be over-specific.

if the client _did_ specify a CAS for the operation, then I don't believe bucket_store() could return ENGINE_NOT_STORED; I think it would have failed with ENGINE_EEXISTS.

Can you double check what happens if you expand your test case to specify an input CAS?

Assuming I'm correct, I think it's clearer if you simply add a second else clause which just checks for ENGINE_NOT_STORED (and doesn't need to consider `cas`).

Line:225, tests/testapp/testapp_arithmetic.cc -> As previous comment, track this under an MB.

Line:226, tests/testapp/testapp_arithmetic.cc -> DCP is only for streaming data connections to replicas / GSI etc. You can just say "client" here.

Line:257, tests/testapp/testapp_arithmetic.cc -> As per the similar subdoc test, suggest you make change the sequence so we only return "normal" (i.e 0) for the calls we expect - this means that if something changes later in the calls ArithmeticCommandContext makes, the test will (hopefully) fail.

(Note you can add a second call to configureEwouldBlockEngine() after your increment to disable it so the get() operations to check the result succeed).
