DESCRIPTION:

MB-43879: Track deallocation of EpEngine sub-objects

To verify that all memory allocations & deallocations associated with
an EpEngine object are correctly accounted for, defer unregistering
the engine from the Arena client until the entire object (and child
objects) have been deleted.

With this change we can successfully assert that when an Arena client
is unregistered, it has zero outstanding bytes allocated (for a simple test which just creates and deletes an engine).
