DESCRIPTION:

MB-38315: Evict deleted items in FullEviction

Currently we do not allow the eviction of deleted items. This means that
a BGFetch can load a deleted item into the HashTable which cannot be
removed by the item pager. Allow the eviction of deleted items from the
HashTable to free memory. This treats them in the same way as BGFetched
non-deleted items.

I also think we should target this for 6.5.2 given it's a pretty significant problem in DGM workloads - assuming I understand correctly we can end up with deleted items stuck forever in HT?
Line:243, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Why only full eviction? Conceptually we shouldn't keep tombstones around forever in value eviction (on a normal delete we'll remove the SV from the HashTable once persisted).

Line:730, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> As previous comment, I think we should do this for both eviction modes.

That's correct. Will re-target and look into value eviction more.

Line:246, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Don't we have the issue even in the very basic case?
Ie, a delete is persisted (so not dirty anymore), but the old condition returns false forever for any deleted item.

Retargetted to MH - http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/124832
Line:243, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> I've removed this comment (adds confusion I think). We only care about this for FE as we can't (or at least I can't work out how to) get clean, deleted, items in the HashTable in VE. I've removed the VE case to simplify the code.

Line:246, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> No, on persistence of a delete we remove it from the HashTable.

Line:730, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> I can't work out how to get a deleted item (that is not dirty) in the HashTable in VE so can't make the test work for that. I could "hack" one in to run the test but that feels bad.
