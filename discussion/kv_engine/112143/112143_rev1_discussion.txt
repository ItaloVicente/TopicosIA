DESCRIPTION:

MB-35062: Tolerate prepare(k), delete(k) in a disk snapshot

When receiving a disk snapshot the replica must allow both
items in and store both to disk. This change updates processSoftDelete
so that the delete is not considered a "no-key" error.

The orginal defect occurred because the following occurs on
the active:

    1) Prepare(k)
    2) Commit(k)

Disk now looks like:

    seq:1 prepare(k)
    seq:2 commit(k)

Next a delete(k) occurs and disk now looks like:

    seq:1 prepare(k)
    seq:3 delete(k)

If we now build a replica from this disk sequence, DCP will transmit:

    seq:1 DCP prepare(k)
    seq:3 DCP delete(k)

The replica must process both of these messages and persist both a
prepare and delete, prior to this patch the delete was dropped
because the vbucket had no committed value to delete.

Line:3432, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Note this orginal clause is a bugger to test for because PassiveStream converts all "no-key" errors on delete into success. I think that a no-key should be success only if disk-snapshot... but not exactly sure I want to make the change in passivestream

Fix looks good. I think the comments could be expanded a little to make it clearer what's going on - see below.
Line:3422, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Style: Personally I think it's clearer to have the early-return here (and avoid the extra nesting), also requires less code change but it'll not insist on changing ;)

Line:3430, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Might be worth expanding this comment - not obvious (to me at least) why encountering a committed item in the HashTable outside a disk snapshot should fall with `NotFound`...

(and again, I think the early-exit would be simpler here :)

Line:3434, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Perhaps also expand here why we can do this for a disk snapshot.

Line:3440, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Would like a comment on why we need this (see EPVBucket::processImplicitlyCompletedPrepare)
