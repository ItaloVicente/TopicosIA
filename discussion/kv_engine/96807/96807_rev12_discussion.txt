DESCRIPTION:

Run engine_testapp tests in same process

engine_testapp currently runs each test in it's own process - it loads
the testsuite plugin, then exec()s the test in a child process; with
the parent waiting for the child's status code.

While this does have some advantages - for example a segfault in a
single test doesn't take down the whole suite - it does come with
noticable runtime overheads to perform the child creation -
particulary on Windows where process creation is more expensive than
Linux.

Additionally, this model means that we dlopen() the engine once for
every test (and in a new process each time); which requires the
runtime linker to re-link each time.

To reduce these costs; change engine_testapp to run each test in the
same (parent) process. To achieve this a few areas of the code had to
be changed:

* The test failure function abort_msg() previously called abort() and
  relied on the parent process reading the exit code. This prevents us
  continuing with the rest of the tests in the testsuite. Replace this
  with throwing a new exception type, which is caught by the top-level
  test execution loop.

* Previously each test case ran with a "clean" instance of the
  testsuite plugin and engine_testapp (as each ran in a new
  process). This is no longer the case; so any latent bugs where a
  test didn't clean up correctly, or reset state back to default are
  now highlighed. Identify and fix these - for example in mock_dcp not
  all last_dcp messages were correctly reset in clear_dcp_data().

* Update default_engine to delete its EngineManager when shutting down
  the default.so plugin - previously if you then tried to re-open the
  plugin (and create default buckets) it would fail as it was still in
  the 'shutdown' state from the previous opening.

On macOS this gives ~12% reduction in user+sys for kv_engine tests:

    time ctest -j8

    Before: 1386 user+sys
    After:  1222 user+sys
