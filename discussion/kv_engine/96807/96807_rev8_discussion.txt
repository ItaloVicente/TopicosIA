DESCRIPTION:

Run engine_testapp tests in same process

engine_testapp currently runs each test in it's own process - it loads
the testsuite plugin, then exec()s the test in a child process; with
the parent waiting for the child's status code.

While this does have some advantages - for example a segfault in a
single test doesn't take down the whole suite - it does come with
noticable runtime overheads to perform the child creation -
particulary on Windows where process creation is more expensive than
Linux.

Additionally, this model means that we dlopen() the engine once for
every test (and in a new process each time); which requires the
runtime linker to re-link each time.

To reduce these costs; change engine_testapp to run each test in the
same (parent) process. To achieve this a few areas of the code had to
be changed:

* The test failure function abort_msg() previously called abort() and
  relied on the parent process reading the exit code. This prevents us
  continuing with the rest of the tests in the testsuite. Replace this
  with throwing a new exception type, which is caught by the top-level
  test execution loop.

* Previously each test case ran with a "clean" instance of the
  testsuite plugin and engine_testapp (as each ran in a new
  process). This is no longer the case; so any latent bugs where a
  test didn't clean up correctly, or reset state back to default are
  now highlighed. Identify and fix these - for example in mock_dcp not
  all last_dcp messages were correctly reset in clear_dcp_data().

* Update default_engine to delete its EngineManager when shutting down
  the default.so plugin - previously if you then tried to re-open the
  plugin (and create default buckets) it would fail as it was still in
  the 'shutdown' state from the previous opening.

On macOS this gives ~12% reduction in user+sys for kv_engine tests:

    time ctest -j8

    Before: 1386 user+sys
    After:  1222 user+sys

(I'm tempted to say that we should just terminate test execution at the first error, as we don't have proper "cleanup" code for test failures so the next one will probably fail as well)

Certainly we don't overall have proper cleanup; but in my local testing I certainly saw cases where'd you'd get the majority of tests pass after an initial failure; so the mechanism isn't necessarily as broken as you might think - if we can get even just a few errors at once (instead of having to fix the first; re-run; see the next error...) then I think it's worth keeping it trying to run the later ones.
