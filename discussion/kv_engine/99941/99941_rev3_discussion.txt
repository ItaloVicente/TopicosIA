DESCRIPTION:

Add support for 'authentication-only' for external auth

If memcached already have an entry for the user it wants
to authenticate we don't need a new copy of the RBAC
entry for the user.

Note that we currently don't prune external entries in
the cache which isn't currently being used so that the
entry can't go away (without a restart)

Q: Does asking for "authentication-only" from ns_server actually save them any work? I assume they still have to go over the network to the LDAP server - so does this feature actually give us any benefit?

They will cache the username / password combinations. This saves them from calculating the privilege set every time (assuming that the user is already logged in).. that username / password cache is used for all of the different services in cbauth (personally I don't see why they don't cache the privilege set as well, but this is the ask from them and it isn't such a big problem for us to do

Ok, fine is that's how ns_server want to handle.
