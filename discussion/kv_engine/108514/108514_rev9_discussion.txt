DESCRIPTION:

MB-33332 [SR] Implement commit for EphemeralVBucket

Implement EphemeralVBucket::commitStoredValue(). This is logically
equivalent to the sibling method EPVBucket::commitStoredValue(),
however it goes about the process in a slightly different way.

+Problem Scenario+

At a high level, commit requires:

1. Convert Prepared OSV -> Committed OSV
2. Remove any previously Committed OSV.

However, for Epheremal there are a few challenges in implementing this
(compared to Persistent):

a) Handling of the seqList, especially if a range read is
   in-flight. If so, then we cannot just modify existing items (both
   previous Commit, and current Prepare). Must instead create new
   items and add to the seqList.

b) Removal of old prepare (so writes can now be accepted against that
   key).
   For Persistent VBuckets we simply modify the Prepare to be a
   Commit. For Ephemeral this isn’t possible - if the prepare is in a
   RangeRead then we cannot modify it. We could remove it from the
   HashTable (leaving in seqList), but that would mean that a
   subsequent Prepare wouldn’t be able to find it (and mark the old
   one as stale) - as we rely on the HashTable for byKey lookup.
   Note also that Persistent disk schema keeps (most recent) prepare
   on-disk, hence why we want to keep in the seqList the current
   Prepare for ephemeral)

Also recall Ephemeral "replacement" values
(http://review.couchbase.org/81932) - if an OSV is marked stale then
it can point to a replacement value which should be used instead
during a subsequent range read.

*If* we chose to convert the existing Prepare to a Committed OSV, then
 if prepare is in a range read and if we marked the prepare as stale,
 what should the replacement point to?

- nullptr? Well, that’s not correct given there could be a subsequent
  (new) Prepare added later, and we’d have duplicate ones in the
  single snapshot.
- The Commit? Again, that’s incorrect as the Commit doesn’t (at the
  moment) replace the Prepare - we expect both.

+Chosen Approach*

As such, a different approach is used for Ephemeral:

* Prepare - Just treat as add (if first prepate for htis key) / update
  of Prepared OSV.

* Commit - Flag Prepare as completed (so ESYNC_WRITE_IN_PROGRESS is
  stopped and clients can modify the key again), then treat as add /
  update of Committed OSV using data from prepare.

* Abort - Delete the Prepare.

Note this approach is _slightly_ less efficient than the Persistent
vBucket impl in the case where this is the first Prepare+Commit for a
key:

EPVBucket::commitStoredValue() only ever creates 1 StoredValue (same
one used for Prepare and then converted to a Commit), whereas this
approach will always create a second OSV for the Commit. However given
we need both a Prepare & Commit in the seqList for Ephemeral then this
approach seems a reasonable choice for Ephemeral.
