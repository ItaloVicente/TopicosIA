DESCRIPTION:

MB-30552: Convert type of vBucket id's from uint16_t to Vbid [1/n]

(Stage 1 of n) This commit aims to change the usage type of vBucket
id's to the new type 'Vbid' within the inner workings of each
function. This allows greater control over what operations can be
performed on a vBucket id, as well as ensuring the output formatting
is consistent. To support the splitting of this into multiple stages,
Vbid can currently be implicitly converted back to uint16_t to
cover elements that have not yet been converted.

(24 comments)

Approach looks good - nice to have an explicit strong type for vbucket IDs. Few specific comments below:
Line:64, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> Suggest you instead change this to `Vbid`.

Line:84, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> Maybe this in in a future patch, but I'd change this argument to be of type `Vbid`

Line:130, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> Just combine this back as it was - then we can construct the vector of the correct size in the first place.

Line:138, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> Good use for auto:

 for(auto vbId : bg_vbs)

Line:483, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Suggest you keep the const (i.e. we can't change the VbId once the object is constructed).

Line:56, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Again, can be a follow-up patch but I'd change notifyVBConnections to take a type Vbid.

Line:142, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Same here - have it return a vector of Vbids.

Line:895, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Again here, just use Vbid for db_file_id

Line:1899, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This looks like essentially a no-op change - either revert or convert to use Vbid.

Line:57, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill.h -> Vbid

Line:117, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> Suggest being consistent and use .get() where you did earlier.

Line:1005, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Shouldn't this not have .get() on the end - as we will end up without the vb: prefix ?

Line:22, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Why is this needed - I don't see any other changes in this file.

Line:40, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> As an aside I don't think this needs to be a reference - doesn't look like change it in this function. Simpler to just pass by value.

Line:872, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Given in this case we are explicitly printing in a different format (vb_XXX); I'd just simplify and change line 863 to:

 uint16_t vbid = vb->getId().get();

Line:175, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> I think you're missing a leading space here to separate the fields.

Line:271, engines/ep/src/item.h -> Style: given you're changing this line anyway you could delete the C-style (unnecessary in C++) `void` here.

Line:980, engines/ep/src/mutation_log.cc -> Might as well drop the `const` here - doesn't really add anything (it's a value - i.e. copied so const not very useful).

You could even just use auto.

Line:56, engines/ep/src/mutation_log.h -> Ordering is a bit messed up here (was already before you changed it!) - should be in the following order:

https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#include-style

Line:131, engines/ep/src/mutation_log_entry.h -> You've changed the format of the vbucket here. I'd leave this so we keep the data represented in network order in the object.

(While you could well be correct that we can simplify, I'd stick to keeping this patch to being as mechanical as possible).

Line:2491, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Just call .get() on it.

Line:125, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> This is probably fine as an interim, but now we have it's own type I'd remove this typedef and just replace all uses of VBucket::id_type with Vbid (in a subsequent patch).

Line:56, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> Not sure you should need this - isn't it implicit?

Line:97, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> Why do we need these? As discussed in person, a vBucket should essentially be immutable.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:142, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> This should already be the case for this function, as it is linked with the VBucketMap::id_type, which in turn is linked further to the main id_type in src/vbucket.h which has been changed to Vbid in this commit.

Line:1899, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Reverted, and changed to auto as discussed. Turns out the two 'getVBucketId()'s are different, so the issue before was one returned Vbid and the other uint16_t. The uint16_t has been noted for a future change.

Line:40, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> I believe it is because it overrides the callback function in callbacks.h, which only seems to link if Vbid is a reference. It'll error & warn without it.

Line:56, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> This was added in response to BuildBot's errors in patch set 1. I believe that if Vbid is used with 'Atomic', then it requires an explicit default constructor, but I could well be wrong with that.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:97, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> I agree that these should eventually be removed, but I would suggest that this is done in a future patch. There are currently 4 uses of triggering for loops that iterate used to iterate with uint16_t but now needed to with Vbid, hence the ++ operator additions in this patch. However, a patch to remove these and reformat the for loops would indeed be useful in making Vbid's immutable and therefore clearer.
