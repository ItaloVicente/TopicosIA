DESCRIPTION:

MB-35061: Remove DcpProducer from vbConns on sending StreamEnd

When `sendStreamEndOnClientStreamClose` is set, we do not immediately
remove a ConnHandler from vbConns, to allow us to shortly send a
StreamEnd. We erroneously *never* removed it in this case.

This became an issue when later removing a DcpConsumer - the old
DcpProducer would be found and removed instead. Then, with an "old"
DcpConsumer left in vbConns, we could add another DcpConsumer when
opening a stream. Several methods assume a single DcpConsumer per VB,
including `DcpConnMap::seqnoAckVBPassiveStream`.

This was first seen as an issue when a replica tried to seqno ack to
a node which was no longer the active for the vb.

The topology changes seen were (roughly) as follows for the three nodes
of interest.

Active Replica
A      B, C
B      A, C
C      A

Change-Id: Iabd52a5ca9a2d129159256529b388e03c87818e2
Solution: Remove the DcpProducer once StreamEnd is sent.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Sure. Precondition everywhere we expect it sound reasonable?

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Well ideally whenever we modify (add) DcpConsumers to the ConnMap; invariants should be maintained on the object itself.
