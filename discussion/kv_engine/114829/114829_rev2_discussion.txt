DESCRIPTION:

MB-33739: Convert VBConn connHandler member to reference

Promoting the weak_ptr from the vbToConns to a shared_ptr is
very (cache) contentious as it is called by different threads so
change this to a reference now that we have introduced ConnStore
to reduce the likelihood of ConnHandler ownership bugs.

Perf stats todo:
