DESCRIPTION:

MB-33739: Convert VBConn connHandler member to reference

Promoting the weak_ptr from the vbToConns to a shared_ptr is
very (cache) contentious as it is called by different threads so
change this to a reference now that we have introduced ConnStore
to reduce the likelihood of ConnHandler ownership bugs.

This patch makes no noticeable change in perf stats. The baseline has
moved greatly since first attempting to do this. Noted a lack of cache
contention on promoting pointers to the DcpProducer in a toy build with
this patch though.

Line:56, engines/ep/src/conn_store.h -> Not sure about the meaning of this.
If we have multiple streams per vbucket then we have multiple entries in the list for that vbid.

std::vector<std::list<std::weak_ptr<ConnHandler>>> vbConns;

Line:55, engines/ep/src/conn_store.h -> If this was referring to when we do weak_ptr::lock(), then it is not the case anymore

Line:55, engines/ep/src/conn_store.h -> refCount is a member of VBConn (not the shared_ptr ref count). 

Our structure is std::vector<std::list<VBConn>>. It's necessary to track refCount manually as we can have multiple streams per vBucket for a single Producer (ConnHandler) when we introduce collections. We only want to remove the entry when the last one goes away.
