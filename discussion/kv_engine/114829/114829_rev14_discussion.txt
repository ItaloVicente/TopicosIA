DESCRIPTION:

MB-36227: Convert VBConn connHandler member to reference

Promoting the weak_ptr from the vbToConns to a shared_ptr is
very (cache) contentious as it is called by different threads so
change this to a reference. This change was made once before which
caused some crashes due to having invalid references lying around in
vbConns. As part of durability though we've found and fixed (hopefully)
all of the bugs where we kept invalid references in vbConns as they
were causing assertions to fire when seqno acking.
