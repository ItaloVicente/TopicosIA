DESCRIPTION:

MB-36112: Do not move PCS in disk snapshot

We should not move the persistedCompleteSeqno in a disk snapshot as
this may break our warmup optimization. We currently move it
whenever we receive an abort but due to de-dupe and out of order
completion we could end up receiving a prepare followed by an abort
for a different key. If we would ever be promoted, whilst we would
have lost data, we want to warmup and recommit the prepare as we will
then be at a consistent point up to the Abort. Also, this will prevent
the PCS from being greater than the PPS on disk when we persist a
partial disk snapshot.

Code looks good, just some suggestions to improve the description of it.
Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Lots of good stuff in here, but I think you should expand it a bit - for some one not intimately familiar with SyncWrites (or even ourselves 6 months from now!) there's statements which aren't explained. For example:

> If we would ever be promoted, whilst we would have lost data ...

Why would we have lost data?

> Also, this will prevent the PCS from being greater than the PPS on disk when we persist a partial disk snapshot.

Why does this matter?

> ... the PCS from being greater than the PPS

First use of PPS here, might be worth expanding it to aid the reader.
