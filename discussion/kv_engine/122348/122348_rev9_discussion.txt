DESCRIPTION:

MB-37943: Compaction - update purge seqno before writing new files

Currently when compacting we set the VBucket::purge_seqno after
our compaction call returns. This exposes a very narrow window where
we may accept a stream request that we should not as the start seqno is
less than the logical purge_seqno (based on the items on disk) but
greater than the actual one tested (stored in the VBucket object).

The race condition is as follows:

1. Write document "A"
2. DcpConsumer connects and streams mutation of "A" at seqno 1.
3. DcpConsumer disconnects
4. Delete document "A" - seqno 2.
5. Write document "dummy" - seqno 3. Necessary as we never compact away
   the final item
6. Wait the duration of the metadata purge interval
7. Run compaction, saving the new file and deleting the old, but don't
   yet update the purge seqno of the VBucket object. This should remove
   the tombstone of document "A" leaving only "dummy" on disk
8. DcpConsumer reconnects and creates a StreamRequest for the given
   vBucket with start seqno 1. This is greater than the logical purge
   seqno of "2" but less than the actual purge seqno (0) stored in the
   VBucket object. This StreamRequest is currently successful
9. DcpConsumer then streams the dummy item and misses the delete of
   document "A". DcpConsumer has items at seqno 1 and seqno 3, but
   never received seqno 2.

Correct this race condition by setting the VBucket::purge_seqno before
we write the new vBucket file (and delete the old one).
