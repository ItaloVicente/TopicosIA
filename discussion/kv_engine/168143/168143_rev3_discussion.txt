DESCRIPTION:

MB-50124: Add possible stat keys to help text in mcstat

Extend the output from mcstat to print the available stat
keywords (with a _SHORT_ description on their usage).

To ensure that we don't sneak in new undocumented fields
the stats parsing will look up the stat key from this
table.
