DESCRIPTION:

MB-31978: Use StreamContainer in DcpProducer

Change the DcpProducer map so that it now maps from vbid
to a shared_ptr<StreamContainer> however the StreamContainer
only stores a single Stream.

This patch updates the DcpProducer code that relies on the streams
map to now lookup the value (shared_ptr<StreamContainer>) and then
use the StreamContainer iteration methods to locate the Stream
and complete there work, again only one stream is in the container,
but the code is now in-place for the creation of extra streams per
VB.

Line:915, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> nit: find_if2

Line:1133, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> nit: could be one line

Line:1147, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Would put this back in the else. In the case where stream is not active we would log "Stream type is {} and not the expected Active" AND then "Unable to find stream" which isn't really indicative of what happened.

Line:1174, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Probably not an issue for this patch (possibly not an issue at all), but do we want to notifySeqnoAvailable every stream vs only those which would be allowed by the filter?

Line:1280, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> vb does not exist in map. It could exist AND have no streams (empty StreamContainer)

Line:1296, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> vb exists in map AND has no streams

Line:1502, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> if vb exists but the stream does not then we don't add it? Or is that for a future patch?

Line:455, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> I'm not sure streams is a good name for this anymore. Perhaps it's just unfamiliarity but I found myself confusing "streams" (vb->streamcontainer map) with the streams belonging to a vb. Personally would suggest "streamsMap" but don't mind if you want to leave as it is.

Line:1296, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> need some more thought - if there were no streams I don't think we should be in the loop at all, i.e. would we have null shared_ptrs in the map...

Line:1502, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> This function assumes the vb exists, caller checks.

In this patch we go from no mapping, to a map with 1 element. This patch maintains code from the prior version where a dead stream gets replaced.

Future patch will allow the push_back of more streams on the VB
