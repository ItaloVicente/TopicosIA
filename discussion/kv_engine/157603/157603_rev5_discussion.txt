DESCRIPTION:

MB-46827: Introduce the new checkpoint memory recovery logic

With this patch the checkpoints memory behaviour is fully driven by:
- checkpoint_memory_ratio
- checkpoint_memory_recovery_threshold

At any incoming mutation the system checks whether the new data can be
accepted/rejected and whether checkpoint memory recovery needs to be
attempted, with the following logic:
- if the checkpoint mem-usage is below the recovery threshold, then
  just accept the mutation
- else, if the checkpoint mem-usage is above the recovery threshold,
  then accept the mutation and trigger checkpoint mem-recovery
- else, checkpoint mem-usage has hit the checkpoint quota, so reject the
  mutation (enter a TempOOM phase) and trigger checkpoint mem-recovery
