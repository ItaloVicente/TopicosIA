DESCRIPTION:

MB-46827: Introduce the new checkpoint memory recovery logic

With this patch the checkpoints memory behaviour is fully driven by:

- checkpoint_memory_ratio
- checkpoint_memory_recovery_upper_mark
- checkpoint_memory_recovery_lower_mark

At any incoming mutation (see note below for details on what is
included and what excluded) the system checks whether the new data can
be accepted/rejected and whether checkpoint memory recovery needs to be
attempted, with the following logic:

- If the checkpoint mem-usage is below the recovery_upper_mark, then
  just accept the mutation
- Else, if the checkpoint mem-usage is above the recovery_upper_mark,
  then accept the mutation (ie, don't enter any TempOOM phase) and
  trigger checkpoint mem-recovery
- Else, checkpoint mem-usage has hit the checkpoint quota (as defined by
  checkpoint_memory_ratio), so reject the mutation (ie, enter a
  TempOOM phase) and trigger checkpoint mem-recovery

Checkpoint memory recovery attempts to push the checkpoints mem-usage
down to recovery_lower_mark, then it yields.

The patch sets checkpoint_memory_ratio=0.5 to maintain a similar
behaviour (in terms of mem-recovery thresholds) to the old
cursor_dropping_checkpoint_mem_upper_mark (now unused, will be removed
in a follow-up patch).

*Note on what this patch covers*

The new checkpoint quota is enforced for Alive Mutations, Prepares and
tombstones created via CreateAsDeleted. Which are essentially covered by
the VBucket::add/set code paths touched in this patch.

We exclude Deletion/Expiration for now as they are operations that
implicitly lead to memory recovery (as the StoredValue is released from
the HashTable as soon as the tombstone is persisted).

Obvioulsy here we introduce an inconsistency in the behaviour between
CreateAsDeleted and Deletion/Expiration. That doens't seem bad though,
as while Deletion/Expiration retains only the SysXattrs (if any) in the
payload, CreateAsDeleted may carry a much bigger payload in the Xattr
chunk. So enforcing the checkpoint quota for the latter seems
reasonable.

Finally, also Commit and Abort bypass the checkpoint quota checks. That
doesn't seem a big deal to date as they small items compared to
mutations. Also, we need to verify what are the side-effects of failing
a Commit/Abort by no-mem, so just deferring to now.
