DESCRIPTION:

MB-46827: Introduce the new checkpoint memory recovery logic

With this patch the checkpoints memory behaviour is fully driven by:

- checkpoint_memory_ratio
- checkpoint_memory_recovery_upper_mark
- checkpoint_memory_recovery_lower_mark

At any incoming mutation the system checks whether the new data can be
accepted/rejected and whether checkpoint memory recovery needs to be
attempted, with the following logic:

- If the checkpoint mem-usage is below the recovery_upper_mark, then
  just accept the mutation
- Else, if the checkpoint mem-usage is above the recovery_upper_mark,
  then accept the mutation (ie, don't enter any TempOOM phase) and
  trigger checkpoint mem-recovery
- Else, checkpoint mem-usage has hit the checkpoint quota (as defined by
  checkpoint_memory_ratio), so reject the mutation (ie, enter a
  TempOOM phase) and trigger checkpoint mem-recovery

Checkpoint memory recovery attempts to push the checkpoints mem-usage
down to recovery_lower_mark, then it yields.

The patch sets checkpoint_memory_ratio=0.5 to maintain a similar
behaviour (in terms of mem-recovery thresholds) to the old
cursor_dropping_checkpoint_mem_upper_mark (now unused, will be removed
in a follow-up patch).

-1 for if we need to handle delete also?
Line:214, engines/ep/configuration.json -> We can tune this further, but I do think something in the region of 90% is better - what's the point in giving memory to checkpoint manager  (via checkpoint_memory_ratio) if it's not allowed to use it? ;)

Line:3298, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Do we need a similar check for delete (which can have potentially a large value these days)?

So theoretically one would say that any operation queued into the CM must check the CM-quota limit.
In practical not sure, as for the Bucket-quota limit we skip the check for Delete/Expiry. Maybe that's because historically we considered deletions as a path to mem-recovery? Or maybe we just missed it :shrugh: Planned to discuss offline.
It seems fine to start with what this patch covers (ie, alive mutations) and then expand in case.

Line:214, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Hehe indeed - The semantic of a value like 0.6 is more to consider that mem-recovery is not instantaneous, so under load you may still hit the CM-quota (and thus tempoon'ing) if you don't start mem-recovery in advance.
But yes, let's set it to 0.9% and see how it behaves - we'll need test&tuning anyway for finding a decent default

Line:214, engines/ep/configuration.json -> For now defaulting this to 0.9 and the checkpoint_memory_recovery_lower_mark below to 0.6.
Which are similar values already experimented in the linked MB and the system behaved quite well in terms of both ingestion-rate / active RR.

As per offline discussion, allowing Deletion/Expiration and Commit/Abort to bypass the checkpoint quota checks for now. Details on why in the updated commit message.
