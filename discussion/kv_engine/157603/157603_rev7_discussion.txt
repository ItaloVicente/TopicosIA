DESCRIPTION:

MB-46827: Introduce the new checkpoint memory recovery logic

With this patch the checkpoints memory behaviour is fully driven by:
- checkpoint_memory_ratio
- checkpoint_memory_recovery_threshold

At any incoming mutation the system checks whether the new data can be
accepted/rejected and whether checkpoint memory recovery needs to be
attempted, with the following logic:
- if the checkpoint mem-usage is below the recovery threshold, then
  just accept the mutation
- else, if the checkpoint mem-usage is above the recovery threshold,
  then accept the mutation (ie, don't enter any TempOOM phase) and
  trigger checkpoint mem-recovery
- else, checkpoint mem-usage has hit the checkpoint quota (as defined by
  checkpoint_memory_ratio), so reject the mutation (ie, enter a
  TempOOM phase) and trigger checkpoint mem-recovery

The patch sets checkpoint_memory_ratio=0.5 to maintain a similar
behaviour (in terms of thresholds) to the old
cursor_dropping_checkpoint_mem_upper_mark (now unused, will be removed
in a follow-up patch).
