DESCRIPTION:

MB-42688: Do not check vbucket state on each comparator call

Cherry picks http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/140126

Would normally have been merged forward, but was cherry picked for
expedience.

The vbucket comparator returned by

PagingVisitor::getVBucketComparator()

must meet the requirements of a comparator for std::sort
( https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Compare )

The comparator must not be affected by changes to the vbucket while
sorting, otherwise mid-way through std::sort it may begin giving
inconsistent results.

The comparator previously cached the pageable mem usage to avoid
this, but _did not_ read the vbucket state ahead of time.

As a result, a vbucket state change part way through the call to
std::sort made by VBCBAdaptor could lead to a crash on some platforms.

Fixed by checking the vbucket state once ahead of time.
