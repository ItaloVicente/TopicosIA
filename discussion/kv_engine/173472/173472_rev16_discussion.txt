DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Continue/Cancel RangeScan on an I/O task

Add RangeScanContinueTask (READER) which is a task to be scheduled
in response to scan continue or cancel requests.

For continue, the "scanning" occurs on the I/O task.
For cancel, the destruct (close of snapshot) occurs on the (same) I/O
task.

In this commit the task "model" is intentionally simple, 1 new task
created per continue or cancel. The focus of the commit is the
scan continue/cancel logic and a future commit will look to improve
the task model by limiting the tasks and/or limiting the concurrency.

Line:473, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.h -> Might be helpful to define "ready" here, or refer to a definition / more info elsewhere.

Line:108, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan.cc -> I believe you can simplify this to:

 syncContinueState.rlock()->state == State::Idle;
 
(i.e. you only really need the withR/WLock() method if you need to perform multiple statements on the same locked state object). Similary below.

Line:206, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan.cc -> Similary here, you can just do:

 auto cs = *syncedContinueState.rlock();
 
(Exact syntax might be wrong, but it's something like that...)

Line:212, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan.cc -> ditto

Line:202, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan.h -> Style: `synced` seems a bit redundant in the name.

Line:27, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_continue_task.h -> Can OneShotTask be used here (putting vbid and bucket& in the std::function capture?)

Line:56, executor/tasks.def.h -> I think we should run this on AuxIO thread pool - that's more intended for bulk IO operations, and running this task on Reader thread pool could have an impact on BGFetch task schedule (queue) times.

Line:27, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_continue_task.h -> I'm still not sure OneShot is relevant for engine tasks as they won't get cancelled on engine shutdown, especially if they take reference/pointer of engine objects could be a bad time?

Also upstream this task /may/ re-run if work exists
