DESCRIPTION:

MB-39292: 1/n VB::Manifest holds shared_ptr to the manager

This is 1 of a series of patches that improve collection metadata
handling with the final goal of detecting when scopes or collections
have a legal or illegal change of name. Prior to this series of patches
there is no easy way for the VB collection update logic to access the
name of a collection.

Some of the aims of the patch series:

* To keep the VB collection update logic reasonably similar to how
  it worked before this series. Specifically avoid any need to to
  'ewouldblock' patterns during DCP induced takeover or direct
  set-vbstate.

* To avoid further memory consumption (certainly scaling with
  collections * vbuckets). Collections and scopes *generally* have
  the same name, so part of this series is to keep 1 bucket copy rather
  than 1 vbucket copy (and a name could be 251 bytes).

This series begin here by reorganising the Collections::Manager
ownership. The Manager will be the object that stores the name (and
even more), and as such the KVBucket owned Manager needs to be
accessible from a VB::Manifest.

This isn't as simple as giving a reference to the 'unique' Manager
because of the way that VBuckets can outlive the KVBucket. This
certainly happens in VBucket deferred deletion where a deletion task
can run after KVBucket destruction.

This is why we switch from unique to shared ownership, allowing the
VB::Manifest to access the Manager, even after KVBucket destruction.

(8 comments)
Line:101, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Useful here or elsewhere to document what the Manager is for.

Line:884, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Can the manager of a manifest be changed after construction? It not suggest making this const.

Line:268, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> Do we need to pass both bucket and kvstore? If we have bucket can we not acquire the kvstore from that?

Line:368, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> Ditto

Line:883, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Similar to previous; if collectionsManager cannot be chanted once a KVBucket  created can be const.

Line:38, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/vbucket_manifest_test.cc -> More idiomatic to pass manager by value - see https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-sharedptrparam-owner

Line:103, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_test.cc -> Nit: can reduce duplication with Persistence case a touch by pulling this into a common expression.

Line:162, engines/ep/tools/kvstore_gen.cc -> Do we actually want a different manifest instance here to the one created at line 136?

Line:162, engines/ep/tools/kvstore_gen.cc -> Possibly not, think this change came from search and replace, so we do whatever the prior code does. Looks like there's no need for the second manifest
