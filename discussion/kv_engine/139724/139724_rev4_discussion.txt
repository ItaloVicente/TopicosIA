Line:62, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> I think the bug is conceptually here. We should purge:

a) Committed Deletes (either normal Delete or SyncDelete) after the purge interval.
b) Completed Prepares (SyncWrites) immediately.

This matches the logic for persistent buckets: a completed prepare is redundant - the subsequent Commit/Abort conveys all the necessary information to represent the state of that key in the DCP stream.


(see when SyncWrite/Delete support was initially added: http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/110039/6/engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc#51)

Line:62, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> Q: At (a), you mean "Committed" or "Completed" ? 

Matching the logic of persistent bucket is actually what we already do WRT "Completed" Prepares (committed and aborted): the HTPurger removes them.

The point here is: are we breaking http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/109985 ?

Line:62, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> I was thinking of Committed, but I might be speaking imprecisely.

re: your second point (and MB-33332) - I haven't looked into the details, I don't think we need to keep PrepareAborted and PrepareCompleted completed prepares *forever*, there should be some criteria by which we can purge them .

I'm not sure if this is once a snapshot is complete, or maybe after metadata purge interval, or maybe something else? Might be worth discussing with Ben if you haven't already.

Line:62, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> Thought the same, not sure what was the original purpose but sounds strange that we aimed to keeping completed prepares forever.
I propose that we keep this patch as it is as we are addressing only the issue on Pending prepares here, do we agree on that? I'm fixing the unit test here btw

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:62, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> Thanks for info Ben.
I'm removing this comment from here as per offline discussion as the @todo was intended for future investigation. I ve opened MB-42608 for that.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:62, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> We didn't intend on keeping completed prepares forever, that's why this code should purge them when they're older than the purgeAge.

I believe that aborted prepares do need to be kept until they are older than the purgeAge to ensure that a new node can backfill correctly (they're basically the ephemeral version of an abort).

I don't think that it's necessary to keep them beyond the lifetime of any seqlist snapshot that may require them. I'm not sure how correct the current code is wrt to that though at the moment. I get the feeling that I didn't do that originally as it was more work than keeping them until they're older than the purgeAge.
