DESCRIPTION:

MB-35001: Consumer: Avoid duplicate PREs after disk/mem transition

Summary:

When transitioning to the inMemory phase of an Active DCP stream,
ensure that the initial in-memory Snapshot has the CKPT flag set, to
avoid the replica potentially seeing duplicate keys in the same
Checkpoint.

Details:

Consider the following scenario of items on disk and in memory
(checkpoint manager):

    Disk:
    1:PRE(a), 2:CMT(a), 3:SET(b)

    Memory:
                        3:CKPT_START
                        3:SET(b),     4:PRE(a), 5:SET(c)

(items 1..2 were in a removed checkpoint and no longer in-memory.)

An ep-engine replica attempting to stream all of this (0..infinity)
will result in a backfill of items 1..3, with a checkpoint cursor
being placed at seqno:4. Note this isn't the start of the Checkpoint
(which is 3) and hence not pointing at a checkpoint_start item.

As such when this is streamed over DCP (up to seqno:4) the consumer
will see:

    SNAPSHOT_MARKER(start=1, end=3, flags=DISK|CKPT)
    1:PRE(a)
    2:CMT(a)
    3:SET(b)
    SNAPSHOT_MARKER(start=4, end=5, flags=MEM)
    4:PRE(a),
    [[[missing seqno 5]]

If the consumer puts all of these mutations in the same Checkpoint,
then it will result in duplicate PRE(a) items (which breaks Checkpoint
invariant).

Address this by adding the CKPT flag to the Snapshot marker when
transitioning between disk and memory snapshots.

Note there is still an oustanding issue with the calculation of the
failover table branch point as a consequence of this change; however
that is being deferred for a second MB - see MB-35003.
