DESCRIPTION:

Build speed [1/6]: Move collections constants to own header

Using ClangBuildAnalyzer highlighted that the header
'collections_types.h' 4th is the most "expensive" header to include when
building ep-engine_ep_unit_tests. Expensive is defined as the time
taken to include across all compilation units which had to include it.

Overall time to build ep-engine_ep_unit_tests and top 5 expensive headers:

Before:
      152.54 real      1529.12 user        87.93 sys

    *** Expensive headers:
    202127 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h (included 118 times, avg 1712 ms), included via:
    162181 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/vbucket.h (included 97 times, avg 1671 ms), included via:
    103630 ms: tlm/deps/json.exploded/include/nlohmann/json.hpp (included 159 times, avg 651 ms), included via:
    100916 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h (included 136 times, avg 742 ms), included via:
     91843 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h (included 67 times, avg 1370 ms), included via:

Interestingly the vast majority of the per-include cost (742ms) is
from including nlohmann/json.hpp, which by itself takes 651 ms (see
3rd hottest header). nlohmann/json.hpp is only required for some
constants which are used from only two .cc files.

Move those constants and the nlohmann/json.hpp header to a new header -
collections_constants.h. This results in a significant reduction in
the cost to include collections_types.h - results after:

After:
      157.95 real      1516.33 user        85.83 sys

    *** Expensive headers:
    241177 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h (included 118 times, avg 2043 ms), included via:
    171029 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/vbucket.h (included 100 times, avg 1710 ms), included via:
     99087 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h (included 67 times, avg 1478 ms), included via:
     92073 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket_iface.h (included 71 times, avg 1296 ms), included via:
     91851 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.h (included 119 times, avg 771 ms), included via:
