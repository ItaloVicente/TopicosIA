DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Move breakpad functionality to single file

Earlier we had duplicated part of the code in the _linux and
_win32 file (installing and destroying the handler).

Line:95, daemon/breakpad.cc -> Given this function always has the same prototype, I think it would be easier to see what parts are the same / different if we just #ifdef'd the differences - e.g.

 std::unique_ptr<ExceptionHandler> create_handler(
        const std::string& minidump_dir) {
 #if defined(linux).
     // linux code
 #elif defined(WIN32)
     // windows...
 #else
     // other
 #endif
 }

Line:82, daemon/breakpad_settings.h -> Given all these accessors basically add no value (you can get/set all fields; and there's no additional invariants added) we could just remove them and make the members public; given you're refactoring this anyway.

Line:95, daemon/breakpad.cc -> The reason I added it in different sections was that the dump callback had different signatures on all of the platforms..  It would then be multiple "#ifdef-blocks" and I think it would be harder for people to read... After all it is just the signature for the create_handler which is the same in the methods..

What if I add bigger comment sections inside each block about which platform it is for?

Line:82, daemon/breakpad_settings.h -> Done

Line:95, daemon/breakpad.cc -> Personally I think having multiple #ifdef blocks; but less code repetition easier to read / maintain (highlights the differences / parts which are the same), but I don't mind that much - if you prefer the current layout that's fine.
