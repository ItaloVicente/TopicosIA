DESCRIPTION:

MB-31410: Fix lock lifetime in PassiveStream::processBufferedMessages

On a DcpConsumer, when we hit the replication threshold we buffer the
following incoming mutations for deferred processing in the
DcpConsumerTask.
The Consumer cannot process new incoming mutations until the buffer has
been completely drained. That is for ensuring the seqno-invariant.

In MB-20649 we have modified the way we synchronize the Consumer
front-end thread and the bg-thread that runs the DcpConsumerTask. That
makes possible that the front-end thread processes new incoming
mutations before the DcpConsumerTask has drained the buffer. That may
break seqno-invariant.

With this change I fix the synchronization issue and I ensure that
MB-20649 stays fixed as well.

Still looking at the coverage for MB-20649

Line:356, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> This is a bit opaque without reading the MBs themselves. If you want to add a comment here, then add one which describes the reason for this code.

Line:412, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> I'm not keen on the manual unlock / relock - it's still overall complex and error-prone.

Can we not solve this with a different approach - for example what about:

# Acquire lock
# Removing /all/ the messages we plan to process (up to the batch count) from the buffer.
# Release lock.
# Process messages. If we error (have any we cannot process); then re-acquire lock; add leftover messages to front of the buffer (i.e. before any new ones which have been added) and return.

This avoids any fancy manual locking / unlocking; and I think also simplifies the notification.

Would this (or something similar) work?

Line:711, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> Probably simpler to just have a single method which takes a notify::Yes/No argument

Line:158, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.h -> I think the accessor is overkill - just make the member variable (processBufferedMessages_postPopFront_Hook) protected.

Line:212, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.h -> Might be worth at least documenting what it is for (hook executed during function ...)

Line:412, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> So I still hope to solve this in a cleaner way, that's the reason of my -1.
I'm investigating on the old MB-20649 (ie, the change that introduced this issue), and I'm not really sure that the original bug still exists. Obviously I have to be very careful on that, because it was a case of deadlock by lock inversion.

In particular about your example: we cannot do
# Release lock
# Process messages
because that allows the front-end to process new incoming mutations.
Given how the code is today, we /must/ process messages here under lock

Line:412, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> So if the front end is still processing messages (even when buffer processing still occurring), I think we should stop that.

I.e. once we start to buffer messages, we continue to buffer until it’s explciitly disabled - i.e. when last buffered message is processed (and not just popped from the buffer Q).

That /should/ allow something like what I proposed. 

Ideally we’d have a simpler approach where we always (or never!) buffer - hence we avoid the complexity/potential bugs when we try to switch between the two modes.
