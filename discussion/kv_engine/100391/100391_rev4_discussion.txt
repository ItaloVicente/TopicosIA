DESCRIPTION:

MB-31410: Fix lock lifetime in PassiveStream::processBufferedMessages

On a DcpConsumer, when we hit the replication threshold we buffer the
following incoming mutations for deferred processing in the
DcpCosumerTask.
The Consumer cannot process new incoming mutations until the buffer has
been completely drained. That is for ensuring the seqno-invariant.

In MB-20649 we have modified the way we synchronize the Consumer
front-end thread and the bg-thread that runs the DcpConsumerTask. That
makes possible that the front-end thread processes new incoming
mutations before the DcpConsumerTask has drained the buffer. That may
break seqno-invariant.

With this change I fix the synchronization issue and I ensure that
MB-20649 stays fixed as well.

We have a test that covers MB-20649, but I'm not sure that it is working properly (I played with it by re-introducing the issue in MB-20649, but TSan doesn't catch any lock inversion on local cv-machine).
I'm looking at that

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> is it not a case of ENOMEM as the replication throttle is disabled?

Line:55, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.h -> can you move to protected?
Then use MockPassiveStream to access as public members function for testing.

Line:129, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.h -> provide a comment for the function I,e, what does NoNotify mean?

Line:207, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.h -> can it be made protected?

Line:3717, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> could you keep as single thread test and explicitly run the tasks - and show that the frontEndTask is unable to process any messages due to there being buffered mutations?

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes it is ENOMEM, but when Repl-Throttle triggers we return SUCCESS on the front-end end thread (so that's what the Producer receives).
The actual throttling happens because the Consumer will not acknowledge bytes (to the Producer) until it recovers from OOM (note that here OOM means memUsed > replThreshold)

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:55, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.h -> Done

Line:129, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.h -> Done

Line:207, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.h -> It is already :)
Not easy sometimes with Gerrit "skipped common lines"

Line:3717, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> The code in this function is executed when I call passiveStream->processBufferedMessages below at line 3736.

Note that the ASSERT_NO_THROW at line 3736 ensures that threads have interleaved properly (as Monotonic throws if not).

The same is not true on Spock where we don't have any monotonic check. So I'll need extra work when backporting this fix to Spock.

That means also that my comment at line 3727 is wrong: the 'throw' in Monotonic<x> ensures that the test is always valid here.
Again, you'll see a similar comment with some extra work in the backport for Spock.
