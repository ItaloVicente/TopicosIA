DESCRIPTION:

MB-31410: Fix lock lifetime in PassiveStream::processBufferedMessages

On a DcpConsumer, when we hit the replication threshold we buffer the
following incoming mutations for deferred processing in the
DcpCosumerTask.
The Consumer cannot process new incoming mutations until the buffer has
been completely drained. That is for ensuring the seqno-invariant.

In MB-20649 we have modified the way we synchronize the Consumer
front-end thread and the bg-thread that runs the DcpConsumerTask. That
makes possible that the front-end thread processes new incoming
mutations before the DcpConsumerTask has drained the buffer. That may
break seqno-invariant.

With this change I fix the synchronization issue and I ensure that
MB-20649 stays fixed as well.
