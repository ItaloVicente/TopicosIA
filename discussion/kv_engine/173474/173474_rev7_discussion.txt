DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Add a time limit to range scan continue

Add a time limit to the range scan continue so that the scan runs
for a specified amount of time.

As per the design, the timeout only applies to the actual running of
the scan and not for any time spent waiting (e.g. waiting for a
thread).
