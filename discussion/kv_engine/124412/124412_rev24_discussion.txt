Line:574, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Here and above at line 549.
It seems like we can have (errCode == OK) but req.requestFailed(). Why?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> That was right upto 6.5.0 where we had the old VBucket::rejectQueue, which has been removed in 6.5.1.

Currently at flush-fail we just reset the pcursor in CM to the backupPCursor created at CM::getItemsForPersistence.

Talking about "re-queueing" now is a bit misleading, maybe just mention that flush will be re-attempt from the CM.

Line:574, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> failed is a member of request that is only being used for testing. It should never happen for production code but it's kinda crap to have test only stuff in production code. I remove the failed member from the request and just overrode the function in a mock to test with a different error code.

Line:2849, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> For both tests below: they check that the we pass the proper "state" to our callbacks, but there is no verification on that the item will be picked up at the next flush.
There is some new test coverage on this specific area added in MB-37546. Tests are specific to Couchstore, we should probably expand to Magma.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2849, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Testing if the request is resubmitted is beyond the scope of this test. This test is only testing if the kvstore exhibits the correct response. If we want to test the full path, it should be done with extended testing such as with MB-37546, but that should not block this checkin. If needs be, a new defect should be added to address the issue.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2849, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> The "full" stack test was easy to add as we can just re-use the MockMagmaKVStore code written for the KVStore tests.
