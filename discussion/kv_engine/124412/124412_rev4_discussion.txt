DESCRIPTION:

WIP MB-38326: Allow failed IORequests to be requeued

The magma code was not allowing failed IORequests to be requeued as part
of commitCallback.

I have added a fault injection class that can be used to insert faults
into the code. It is very simple.
I was not sure what ifdef to use to turn the fault injection on/off
based on compile time directives. We want the code and tests to be
turned on for debug code and turned off for production code. Needs some
help there.
