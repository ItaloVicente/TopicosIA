DESCRIPTION:

WIP MB-38326: Allow failed IORequests to be requeued

The magma code was not allowing failed IORequests to be re-queued as
part of the commitCallback.

As part of the change in order to support MockMagmaKVStore, I had to
shift some code around.

Just a few minor things
Line:423, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Seems unnecessary to have this status, you check this status twice, but may as well just replace those "commitCallStatus == ...::Failed" checks with "errCode != Status::Code::OK".

Line:1017, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> If you want to rename the function, please do so in a different patch to make this easier to review.

Line:60, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> If you put this in a new header then you wouldn't have to include bucket_logger, the macro, or magma-kvstore-metadata here

Line:2925, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> If you call "initialize_kv_store(kvstore)" here then you don't have to change the prepareToCreate test and other (future) tests don't need to care about the initial state

Line:2948, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> nit: whitespace only change

Line:423, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1017, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> I had to rename the functions because getKey() and getKeyLen() are overloaded and I need to make sure I get the correct function to print out key. I don't understand why this needs to go to a different patch since this patch is the cause of needing to rename the functions. Otherwise, I would have to create a whole new patch with new tests to prove the functions work and this seems more efficient.

Line:60, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> I pulled MagmaRequest to its own .h.
I renamed magma-kvstore-metadata.h to magma-kvstore_metadata.h (- to _).
Not sure I understand rest of the comment as to what can or cannot be included. If I pull those includes, it doesn't appear to compile.

Line:2925, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> This was done on purpose. I don't want to call initialize_kv_store() as that creates issues for other tests like prepareToCreate.

Line:2948, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> This was done on purpose because clang-format failed to catch the proper indentation

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:60, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> You also need to include magma-kvstore_metadata in magma-kvstore_iorequest and de-inline the MagmaRequest ctor back into magma-kvstore.cc. Then you can move the macro and bucket_logger includes back to magma-kvstore.cc

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2948, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Note that the CV clang-format job only considers the formatting of paragraphs which have been modified in the patch, so you should need to change this to get that to pass.
