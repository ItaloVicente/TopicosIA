DESCRIPTION:

WIP MB-38326: Allow failed IORequests to be requeued

The magma code was not allowing failed IORequests to be requeued as part
of commitCallback.

I have added a fault injection class that can be used to insert faults
into the code. It is very simple.
I was not sure what ifdef to use to turn the fault injection on/off
based on compile time directives. We want the code and tests to be
turned on for debug code and turned off for production code. Needs some
help there.

Line:33, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-fault_injection.h -> nit: typo

Line:1231, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> We don't generally put test code in production functions and I don't think we should start now. We generally prefer to mock stuff and have a mock do the desired fault injection
