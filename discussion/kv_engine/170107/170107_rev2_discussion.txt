DESCRIPTION:

MB-50546: Drop connmap releaseLock before removing connection

The releaseLock ensures no actor will release the Cookie/Connection
while the caller is notifying the frontend to step that connection.

This does not need to be held while solely manipulating
ConnStore::vbToConns (which has its own locks anyway).

Drop releaseLock before calling down into ConnStore to prevent
potential lock order inversion.
