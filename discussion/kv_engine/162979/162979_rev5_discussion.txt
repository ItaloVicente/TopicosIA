DESCRIPTION:

MB-47318: Add DCP Control to configure consumer flow control

Allow the client of the consumer to override the flow control
buffer size which can be used by tests to give greater control
over the flow-control logic.

Line:246, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> Mmm by DCP design controls are "Sent by the Consumer to the Producer in order to configure connection settings.". Don't we have any other way of getting to what you need other than implementing this interface?

Line:246, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> I must of missed that design memo :)  I can certainly change the markdown docs if that's the issue, although all controls added here are not for use in GA so keeping them out of the docs is preferable. I basically don't seen any reason why a consumer shouldn't be able to accept and react to control messages, it's incredibly convenient for consumer configuration

Line:246, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> I think I agree with Paolo - the "Consumer" is actually the one who negotiates things with the consumer thus far, changing that for just this one (non-prod) use-case feels like adding quite a bit of complexity and possible confusion down the line.

While it's arguably verbose, I think it might be better to do this as part of the current consumer -> producer negotiations - if the new (test-only) config param set, have producer send a non-successful Control response (possibly status:Erange?) with the proposed new value.

Alternatively it that's too much messing on the wire, Can we not just use the existing config params and set dcp_con_buffer_size to 1 and dcp_flow_control_policy to static?

Line:246, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> Configuration isn't much use as most of the places i'm using this the bucket already exists (and lives between tests), note a second customisatiom is required in the next patch up as well - i'd prefer to not globally set this value either

Requirements are that a bucket already exists and you want to configure a consumer in a certain way, i'm not using a real DcpProducer either, the negoiation you mention is the wrong way round for my needs
