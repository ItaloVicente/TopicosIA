DESCRIPTION:

MB-50256: Give ObserveSeqno its own privilege

To allow ObserveSeqno to operate for collection/scope users
this commit moves the ObserveSeqno command out of the MetaRead
privilege and over to its own ObserveSeqno privilege.

With this in place a user can be granted MetaRead against their
scope or collection and be given ObserveSeqno, allowing them to
operate on the collection and query seqno persistence.

Line:169, include/memcached/rbac/privileges.h -> Nit: C++ (11?) allows you to have a trailing comma in an enum definition, meaning next time we don't need to touch 'ObserveSeqno' when we add the next priv:

 ObserveSeqno,
