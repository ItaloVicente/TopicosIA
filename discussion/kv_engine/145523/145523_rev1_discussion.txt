DESCRIPTION:

Add the callstack to the exception message for the connection

Add the callstack to the message we dump for the connection
when we receive an exception during packet execution and
shut down the connection.

For memory allocation failures during the logging we'll
revert to single line logging and hope our best that another
bad_alloc so we'll try to log as little as possible per
invocation to the logger (as another exception would
kill the process)
