DESCRIPTION:

MB-48038: Implement CheckpointVisitor::getVBucketComparator

In the follow-up patch I will move the checkpoint expel/removal logic
from the CheckpointRemoverTask to the CheckpointVisitor.

In preparation for that, allow the Visitor to visit vbucket in "highest
checkpoint mem-usage" order. Which is the same as what the RemoverTask
currently does.

Change-Id: I8e9e3dd007f2344122a5fb089328ada5a36a7619
