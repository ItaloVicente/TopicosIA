DESCRIPTION:

MB-33167 [SR]: At abort, enqueue an abort_sync_write item into the CM

In this patch:
1) we introduce the new queue_op::abort_sync_write
2) at VBucket::abort, we enqueue a abort_sync_write into the
   CheckpointManager

At this point an abort_sync_write is ready for being processed by
Checkpoint Cursors (both persistence and replication, implemented in
follow-up patches).
