DESCRIPTION:

MB-33167 [SR]: At abort, enqueue an abort_sync_write item into the CM

In this patch:
1) we introduce the new queue_op::abort_sync_write
2) at VBucket::abort, we enqueue a abort_sync_write into the
   CheckpointManager

At this point an abort_sync_write is ready for being processed by
Checkpoint Cursors (both persistence and replication, implemented in
follow-up patches).

Line:625, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> I think it's cleaner if you change the logic here to the following:

1. Mark the StoredValue as aborted (say via a new enum in committed).
2. Call queueDirty() - given we now know the StoredValue is aborted there's no need for the extra queueAbort() very similar function - and indeed we don't need a new toItemAbort() function.

I believe this will reduce the amount of code we need to add, and also will avoid possible subtle bugs later where someone calls queueDirty when they meant queeuAbort or similar.

Line:625, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> We already discussed that: adding a new CommittedState::aborted in StoredValue is (1) unnecessary (as we don't want any abort in the HashTable, just delete the Prepare) and (2) it requires a lot of changes around (e.g., all the switch-case statements need to cover the new entry).

Back in this pacthset chain there's a version of this change with no extra queueAbort(), I just pass a DurableItemCtx (or similar) down to queueDirty() for providing the necessary information (abort / non-abort / etc..), but we preferred the queueAbort() way for avoiding changes to the queueDirty API.

Note that I can remove the toItemAbort() function we a few changes (as specified in the other comment).

Line:625, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> So the issue I see is that thus far, Item has been (roughly) 1:1 mapping with StoredValue  - which means we can essentially just pass an SV around and be able to (a) perform the correct queuing operation and (b) construct a matching Item directly from it. 

I'm not keen on diverging any further way from that model; given it makes the code more brittle - someone not knowledgable about SyncRepl might accudently call queuDirty on an aborted item, or similar. In other words the API is easy to use incorrectly, which is typically a poor choice.

It's true we don't *need* Aborted SVs in the HashTable - but I'm not proposing that - I'm just saying that we "tag" the to-be-removed StoredValue appropriately so the existing assumptions CheckpointManager et al make can be kept.

I think one thing to consider is SyncDelete - as per our conversations the other week, these *cannot* actually be marked as deleted items on-disk - but I don't think we discussed how they are represented in-memory in the HashTable. We /could/ set StoredValue::deleted to be true; but that will at least need a number of stats updating. I'm wondering if instead we use StoredValue::deleted (and commited==pending) to signify an Abort?

Line:625, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> I think that it would be ok.

"Encoding" an Abort as a Pending+Deleted StoredValue has been one of my first attempts actually. But I had to step back because of what you said: currently a Deleted Pending encodes a SyncDelete.

My understanding is that SyncDelete should never be subject to the same expiry/purge semantic as normal deletes on disk, so we are aligned on that.
But, not sure yet how we can encode a SyncDelete in the HashTable, I'm currently reviewing the life-cycle of pending SyncDeletes in the HT to find a good idea.
