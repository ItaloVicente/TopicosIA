DESCRIPTION:

MB-33167 [SR]: At abort, enqueue an abort_sync_write item into the CM

In this patch:
1) we introduce the new queue_op::abort_sync_write
2) at VBucket::abort, we enqueue a abort_sync_write into the
   CheckpointManager

At this point an abort_sync_write is ready for being processed by
Checkpoint Cursors (both persistence and replication, implemented in
follow-up patches).

Line:230, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> as

Line:828, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Why do we need this? The toItemImpl() below has an optional durability::Requirements so I don't see why we need it?

Line:1002, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Can this be const?

Line:1640, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> is this true? don't we change CAS / seqno etc?

(Is this /is/ true then we should change `item` to be const.)

Line:1650, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Should this be protected?

Line:1002, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> It can, fixing.

Line:1640, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Legacy from some previous version of this change, that was referred to a StoredValue input, and here there's no StoredValue at all.
Removing, thanks.

Line:1650, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> It is, like queueDirty and queueAbort (not easy to see that as the protected section starts many lines above :) )

Line:828, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> The one below (with optional Requirements) sets the Item::op depending on the this->getCommitted() state.

As we said, there s no CommittedState::aborted in StoredValue (at abort, the prepare is just removed from the HT).

So I moved the common steps (ie, not the logic where we step Item::op) in this new toItemImpl().

Other functions call it + they set the Item::op as they need. E.g., toItemAbort() does:

    auto item = toItemImpl(false /*lockCas*/, vbucket, true /*keyOnly*/);
    item->setAbortSyncWrite();

Line:828, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> I don't think that's worthy of complicating the API - and indeed it would be nicer if we didn't need the extra item->setbortSyncWrite(). Just add an additional case for pending state == abort; and then handle it all in the single function.

Line:828, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> So, this is a StoredValue -> Item conversion, in input we have the SV's CommittedState that has no entry for "aborted" writes.
I'll try to simplify this code in a different way.

Line:828, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Unfortunately, here we have the same problem discussed for VBucket::queueDirty/queueAbort: we don't have any CommittedState::abort (or similar) in StoredValue, so we need to pass down the "abort" information in some other way when we make the Item.

I could do (a) extra arg in input or (b) dedicated conversion function for "abort".

I go with (b) (i.e., keeping what we have) as the approach is consistent with the addition of VBucket::queueAbort.
Happy to reconsider that if any issue arises though.

Line:828, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> I actually managed to simplify this API a bit, thanks to the fact that toItemKeyOnly() doesn't really need to take any DurReqs in input.

Line:828, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> > toItemKeyOnly() doesn't need any DurReqs

That's true for now, but I'm not sure it will be true in the future.
So for now keeping the current behaviour (we can pass DurReqs when we generate an item with no-value).

Given that the common case is that we include the value (apart from a single case in VBucket::getInternal), I've removed the toItemKeyOnly() function (used only once) and added a defaulted args 'bool includeValue = true' to toItem().

So now we have:

public:
    toItem()
    toItemAbort()
protected:
    toItemBase()

The public functions call down to toItemBase() and do their extra (specific) work.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:828, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> I think you should at least give these two functions different names, as once is really the "inner" function of the other; they arn't simply overloads of each other.
