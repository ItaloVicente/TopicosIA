DESCRIPTION:

MB-33167 [SR]: At abort, enqueue an abort_sync_write item into the CM

In this patch:
1) we introduce the new queue_op::abort_sync_write
2) at VBucket::abort, we enqueue a abort_sync_write into the
   CheckpointManager

At this point an abort_sync_write is ready for being processed by
Checkpoint Cursors (both persistence and replication, implemented in
follow-up patches).

Line:635, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Given our long discussions / changes direction, I think it's worth expanding the comment here to describe _why_ we have this method and not just use `toItem` above - i.e. that on abort a StoredValue is simply immediately removed (and doesn't carry state to "know" it's an aborted value, etc...

Line:984, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Might be nicer to create explicit enum classes for this and `includeValue` below - avoids the need for the comment and makes it more type-safe.

Line:1663, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Given this shouldn't be called directly by anyone (should call queueDirty or queueAbort), can this be given a lower visibility (i.e. make it private)?

Line:635, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Done

Line:984, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I wanted to do something similar but I was not sure if touching more lines in this patch, done then.
I think that the new version is much nicer, also thanks to the fact that we can the default to HideLockedCas::No and IncludeValue::Yes as the most common combination.

Line:1663, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Note that this is protected now, but yes we can make it private as currently not called directly by any subclass/mock-test-class.
Done
