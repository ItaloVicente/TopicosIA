DESCRIPTION:

MB-45185: Rename WantsDropped to HasStaleItems

To decrement the collection disk size by the full value rather than
the tombstone for ONLY magma we need to be able to determine between
couchstore and magma in FlushAccounting. We already pass in
WantsDropped which can be read as IsMagma. WantsDropped does not mean
anything in this new case so rename it to IsMagma which is appropriate
for the existing and proposed new usage of it. WantsDropped was
originally added to deal with collection item counting which differs
between couchstore and magma because magma has stale items, so
HasStaleItems feels like the most appropriate name for this
parameter/type.

Line:68, engines/ep/src/collections/flush.h -> Do we want to update the comment also; if it's about multiple copies of the same item and not dropped collections?

Line:75, engines/ep/src/collections/flush.h -> I assume you're interpreting it as "the store which made this request has stale items". While that's correct, I think it's more a feature of the caller, not the callee (i.e. this class); who shouldn't need to know much about who is calling them, but simply what work _they_ should do.

As such, I think it would it be better to name the argument something like "trackDeletedItems" - i.e. something which conveys what behaviour we want the function to do for us?

Line:75, engines/ep/src/collections/flush.h -> Yeah I'd considered IsMagma too.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:75, engines/ep/src/collections/flush.h -> I thought about that one, but I don't like having TrackDeletedItems::Yes(magma) for the code I'll be adding that stops tracking deleted items (in the collection disk size). I am very open to better names though

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:75, engines/ep/src/collections/flush.h -> I guess the question is - what behaviour in Flush / FlushAccounting do you want to be affecting based on this variable? Conceptually it is "isMagma", but that's generally a poor way to name as it ties to a specific "thing" which just happens to behave in some way (or expect certain behaviour).

In your future patch, what changes in behaviour do you have? Might be worth uploading that alongside this one.
