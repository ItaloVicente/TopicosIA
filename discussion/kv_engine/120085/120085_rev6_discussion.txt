DESCRIPTION:

MB-36227: Make VB Ready Queue lock free

For performance reasons make VBReadyQueue lock free.

Add testing hooks to test push/pop behaviour at interesting points.

The BGFetcher currently uses the VBReadyQueue in an unsual way
and copies the contents of the rather than iterates over them. This
is becuase performance didn't appear to be ideal when used in the
typical manner when we switched the BGFetcher to use a VBReadyQueue.
At the time it was suspected that the lock in the VBReadyQueue was
the cause of this, and removing it allows us to use the VBReadyQueue
in the idiomatic manner. This allows us to remove the swap function
which isn't trivially implementable (or perhaps at all) without the
lock.
