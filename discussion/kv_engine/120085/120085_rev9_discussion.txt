DESCRIPTION:

MB-36227: Make VB Ready Queue lock free

For performance reasons make VBReadyQueue lock free.

Add testing hooks to test push/pop behaviour at interesting points.

The BGFetcher currently uses the VBReadyQueue in an unsual way
and copies the contents of the rather than iterates over them. This
is becuase performance didn't appear to be ideal when used in the
typical manner when we switched the BGFetcher to use a VBReadyQueue.
At the time it was suspected that the lock in the VBReadyQueue was
the cause of this, and removing it allows us to use the VBReadyQueue
in the idiomatic manner. This allows us to remove the swap function
which isn't trivially implementable (or perhaps at all) without the
lock.

Line:30, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could you also include the before numbers so the reader can compare them directly please?

Line:101, engines/ep/src/vb_ready_queue.cc -> What's the lock-free / concurrently behaviour support of this? Seems like clear() isn't safe to call say if another thread is pushing?

Might be worth removing this from the interface; then make it the caller's choice / decision to clear it (by popping everything themselves)?

Line:106, engines/ep/src/vb_ready_queue.cc -> If you're concerned about sanity-check costs, might want to guard this for() loop with the same #define used for the hook checks.

Line:79, engines/ep/src/vb_ready_queue.h -> I agree we probably don't want this in production builds, but I think we should guard this with a more global flag - i.e. it would be useful to have these checks in post-commit jobs or other QE runs.

I'd therefore guard using either `#ifndef NDEBUG` (if we only want in Debug build types; not Release or RelWithDebInfo), or `CB_DEVELOPMENT_ASSERTS` (if we want in all build types prior to GA).

The decision primarily comes down to if adding the testing hooks noticeably affects things like perf tests; we don't want them slowed down really for pre-GA builds.

Line:103, engines/ep/src/vb_ready_queue.h -> I'm not sure we should be fixing the vBucket count - you _can_ have more than 1024 vbuckets; and there's also discussion about setting vBucket count lower for small deployments (just at runtime via ns_server setting the bucket vBucket count). If we locked it at 1024 here then we'd be wasting a bunch of memory in those use-cases.

That does beg the question of how to implement a dynamic capacity (set at runtime) bitfield which is lock-free. I think we need to use std::vector<atomic_bool> here to support such a use-case. That does introduce an extra pointer indirection compared to std::array, but maintains the more efficient memory footprint.

Line:101, engines/ep/src/vb_ready_queue.cc -> It's definitely not safe, but I left it as all call-sites should have made it safe to call (I think).

It looks like we don't need it though, it's only called when we're about to destroy the queue anyway.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:79, engines/ep/src/vb_ready_queue.h -> Will change to debug only builds instead then. It could somehow end up better using CB_DEVELOPMENT_ASSERTS than without if we have some fun alignment issues and that would be a PITA to check/fix at the point at which we disable it.
