DESCRIPTION:

MB-32107: Resolve performance regression

Resolve the performance regression caused by changing the size of
ConnHandler by padding ConnHandler out to a total length of 128 bytes.

Also, pack a hole in the current layout of the class by moving the
reserved member.

Perf testing was done against build 1553 and build 1558 of MadHatter.

Average results for runs:
1553 - 1973894 ops/s (8 runs)
1558 - 1923984 ops/s (8 runs)
