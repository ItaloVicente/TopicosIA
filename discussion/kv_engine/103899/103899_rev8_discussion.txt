DESCRIPTION:

MB-32107: Resolve performance regression

Resolve the performance regression caused by changing the size of
ConnHandler by padding ConnHandler out to a total length of 128 bytes.

Also, pack a hole in the current layout of the class by moving the
reserved member.

Perf testing was done against build 1553 and build 1558 of MadHatter.

Average results for runs:
1553 - 1973894 ops/s (8 runs)
1558 - 1923984 ops/s (8 runs)
Regressing Commit - 1938150 (5 runs)
        (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/101191/ - based on 1553)
This Commit - 1983052 (8 runs)
        (based on 1553 + regressing commit)
