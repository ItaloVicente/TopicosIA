DESCRIPTION:

MB-54455: Add support for ConnectionLimitMode::Block

The default mode of operation when the number of connections
hit the configured limit is to immediately close the new
connection.

This patch adds support for an alternative mode where
we stop accepting new connections when the configured
limit is reached and accept the new connection whenever
an existing connection gets closed.
