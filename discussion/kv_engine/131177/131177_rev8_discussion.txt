DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Only allow canonical leb128 encodings

Add protected is_canonical methods to the unsigned_leb128 class.
These are not general purpose methods and rely on being given a
decoded value/length from the decode function.

The is_canonical functions first compare/switch on the encoded length
and then check the value was larger than a constant. The constant
represents the largest value that would of been encoded in leb128
of 1 byte less. For example if the encoded size was 4 and the value
was 200, a non-canonical encoding was used.

KV collection input validation now checks that any encoded leb128
coming from the client is canonical and will fail if not.

Having a canonical encoding has two benefits.

1) A possible bug in OSO is closed, if non-canonical encodings made it
to disk, keys no longer coalesce in the name index.

2) Some performance optimisation is possible in comparing DocKey types,
a leb128 collection-ID no longer would need decoding for comparison, the
canonical representation can be compared.

As a benchmark for leb128 encoding was introduced before this
change the cost of canonical detection is shown below. The canonical
decode replaces the 'NoThrow' variant.
