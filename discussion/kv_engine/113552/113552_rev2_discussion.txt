DESCRIPTION:

MB-34017: Correct HCS flushing logic

Currently the HCS flushing logic is flawed in two ways:

1) If we disconnect and reconnect a stream then flush a disk
snapshot the HCS may be weakly monotonic (if the active node moves
on and streams to the replica from disk without doing any other
SyncWrites).

2) getItemsForCursor is returning a HCS value before the checkpoint
end. This is incorrect as we can flush partial disk snapshots and a
subsequent warmup may bring the node back in a bad state (missing
prepares). This should work fine if the rest of the disk snapshot is
streamed, but if this node is promoted beforehand and streams from
memory to a replica then the replica will start firing assertions.
This is a dataloss situation already, but undesirable nonetheless.
