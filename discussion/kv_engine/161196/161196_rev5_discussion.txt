Line:23, engines/ep/src/kvstore/storage_common/storage_common/local_doc_parser.cc -> Do we have any memory tracking issues with returning objects which own heap allocations - particulary in terms of correctly allocating to primary vs secondary domain?

Line:29, engines/ep/src/kvstore/storage_common/storage_common/local_doc_parser.cc -> Do you need the const_cast here? It looks like decode() takes a const_byte_buffer - aka sized_buffer<const uint8_t> and hence a reinterpret_cast from `const char*` to `const uint8_t*` should suffice?

Line:54, engines/ep/src/kvstore/storage_common/storage_common/local_doc_parser.cc -> Similary here, Verifier can be constructed from a const uint8_t*.

Line:91, engines/ep/src/kvstore/storage_common/storage_common/local_doc_parser.cc -> Admittedly repetitive, but I think keeping the early returns is overall preferred as the reader doesn't have to keep reading onwards to see if there's any other code executed once a key is matched.

Line:23, engines/ep/src/kvstore/storage_common/storage_common/local_doc_parser.cc -> I don't think so? We won't be calling this from ep-engine anywhere. If we're calling this from couch_dbdump we aren't tracking that memory (afaik) and don't care about it. Ditto for magma_dump if it's truly running standalone, but I vaguely recall some conversation about it linking up with the running process for... reasons. If that's the case then this should (and would) all be executed under a secondary domain guard which seems fine as we aren't allocating anything that will get freed in ep-engine (we aren't entering any ep-engine stuff here).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:23, engines/ep/src/kvstore/storage_common/storage_common/local_doc_parser.cc -> Sounds good. Basically as long as the return value isn't over around between Magma and ep-engine we should be fine. Otherwise we'd need a custom string type whose dtor deallocated on the correct domain.
