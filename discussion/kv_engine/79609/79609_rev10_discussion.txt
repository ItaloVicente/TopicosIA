DESCRIPTION:

MB-22960 - Ensure full backfill when cursor is dropped

Due to cursor dropping we re-register the replication cursor only
during backfill when we mark the disk snapshot.  However by this point
it is possible that the persistence cursor has moved ahead.  This would
mean we would lose data when we switch over to in-memory streaming from
backfilling.

To avoid this data loss on completion of backfill we check to see if the
last persisted seqno is greater than the last read seqno.  If it is then
we know we have missed some items and we must perform another backfill.
