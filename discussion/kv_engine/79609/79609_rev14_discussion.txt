DESCRIPTION:

MB-22960 - Ensure full backfill when cursor is dropped

Due to cursor dropping we re-register the replication cursor only
during backfill when we mark the disk snapshot.  However by this point
it is possible that the persistence cursor has moved ahead.  This would
mean we would lose data when we switch over to in-memory streaming from
backfilling.

To avoid this data loss when we register the cursor we check to see if
the result minus one is greater than the requested starting seqno. If
so we know we have missed some items and we must perform another
backfill.

The reason for the minus one is that registerCursorBySeqno returns the
bySeqno with which the cursor can start and therefore we want to ensure
the previous end is not greater than the requested starting seqno.

Line:5938, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Can you please leave a note why 'prepare_skip_broken_under_ephemeral' ? it will help the person fixing the test case or code for ephemeral

Line:5972, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> ditto

Line:181, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> if you are calling the ActiveStream::registerCursor, then this need not be override right ? it could instead just be a wrapper function calling the protected member func registerCursor()

Line:5938, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> with modified fix - no longer need to disable

Line:5972, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> with modified fix - no longer need to disable

Line:181, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> I need this function to be an override so that when registerCursor is invoked from markDiskSnapshot it calls this function as opposed to ActiveStream::registerCursor.

This function then does some mutex work before then going onto call ActiveStream::registerCursor.
