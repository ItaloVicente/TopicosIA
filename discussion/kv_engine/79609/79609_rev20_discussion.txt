DESCRIPTION:

MB-22960 - Ensure full backfill when cursor is dropped

Due to cursor dropping we re-register the replication cursor only
during backfill when we mark the disk snapshot.  However by this point
it is possible that the persistence cursor has moved ahead.  This would
mean we would lose data when we switch over to in-memory streaming from
backfilling.

To avoid this data loss when we register the cursor we check to see if
the result minus one is greater than the requested starting seqno. If
so we know we have missed some items and we must perform another
backfill.

The reason for the minus one is that registerCursorBySeqno returns the
bySeqno with which the cursor can start and therefore we want to ensure
the previous end is not greater than the requested starting seqno.

Dave - regarding our discussion earlier in the week  I have created a task for testing the functionality of registerCursorBySeqno https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-25009, which I have made a sub-task of MB-22960.

Line:168, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> Comment is inaccurate now and needs updating.

Line:181, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> Probably worth a brief comment describing these. Also - whitespace is inconsistent in the std::function signature (I believe clang-format will format with no space between <>) - either way it shouldn't differ across two adjacent paragraphs!

Line:369, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Why is this so stateful? What happens if this test is re-used and called more times?

If you want two different variants of the test, create a parametrised test.

Line:370, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Don't really see the value in making this a separate method - why not just keep the code inline, given it's only called from one place?

Line:168, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> Have updated.

Line:181, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> Added a comment - and sorry about the whitespace issue, have fixed.

Line:369, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Add a comment on why it is stateful - and should only be invoked once during the test. It is a single test.

Line:370, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> have inlined - and removed separate method.
