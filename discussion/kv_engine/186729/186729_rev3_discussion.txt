DESCRIPTION:

MB-55173: Add unit tests guarding conflict resolution behaviour

In preparation for future changes to conflict resolution code, add a
set of tests covering different combinations of the existing and
incoming documents':

 * Cas
 * RevSeqno
 * Flags
 * Expiry time
 * Xattrs

The tests largely just describe the existing behaviour, but will at
least defend against accidental breakage.
