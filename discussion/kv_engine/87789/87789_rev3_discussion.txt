DESCRIPTION:

MB-27539: ThreadSanitizer detecting false positives

Tests in the PersistToTest set run with the ShutdownMode::Clean and
ShutdownMode::Unclean variants. When memcached is killed
(ShutdownMode::Unclean), ThreadSanitizer detects false race conditions
on the following tests. To fix, we skip 'Unclean' tests when run under
ThreadSanitizer.

Line:43, tests/testapp/testapp_persistence.cc -> Might as well just combine these in one line:

 #  if defined(__has_feature) && __has_feature(thread_sanitizer)

Line:52, tests/testapp/testapp_persistence.cc -> Clenaer to instead never run it - change the INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P instantiation below to not include Unclean when TSan is enabled.

Line:43, tests/testapp/testapp_persistence.cc -> GCC not happy with that:

>/home/couchbase/jenkins/workspace/kv_engine-clang_analyzer-master/kv_engine/tests/testapp/testapp_persistence.cc:258:44: error: missing binary operator before token "("
 #if defined(__has_feature) && __has_feature(thread_sanitizer)
                                            ^
We cannot remove the `#if defined(__has_feature)` because it would break the Windows build.

Line:43, tests/testapp/testapp_persistence.cc -> Ah ok - I was just looking at ep_perfsuite.cc which adds an additional #if __clang__ as currently we only ever run TSan via Clang (I believe newer GCCs might also support it).

What you have is fine then.
