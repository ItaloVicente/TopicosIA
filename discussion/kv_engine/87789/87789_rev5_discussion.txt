DESCRIPTION:

MB-27539: Fix ThreadSanitizer false positives on PersistToTest

Tests in the PersistToTest set run with the ShutdownMode::Clean and
ShutdownMode::Unclean variants. When memcached is killed
(ShutdownMode::Unclean), ThreadSanitizer detects false race conditions
on the following tests. To fix, we skip 'Unclean' tests when run under
ThreadSanitizer.
