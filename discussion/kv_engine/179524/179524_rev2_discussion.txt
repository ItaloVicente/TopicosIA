DESCRIPTION:

Revert "MB-53304: Enforce holding of stateLock in VBucket::queueItem [3/n]"

This reverts commit 9b8ee245b2c73fa68e8ac3f7813465d8ec68fa0d.

Reason for revert: We don't really need to be able to pass other 
kinds of locks as a SharedLockRef. There are better ways to 
approach the problem.
