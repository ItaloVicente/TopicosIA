DESCRIPTION:

MB-32579: Don't switch TLS engine to null on executorpool stats calls

Archaeology shows that 2900340f updated the ExecutorPool so that many
of its methods disable memory tracking (onSwitchThread(null)), the
reason is that ExecutorPool is operating on behalf of many buckets and
as such could incorrectly attribute memory allocations to the a bucket
for global actions.

However MB-32579 shows a crash caused by one of the do*Stats calls
destructing a vbucket (via shared_ptr ref of 0), the vbucket frees an
Item and wants to update the engine memory stats.

The doTaskStats function which is at the root of the crashing backtrace
however is a ExecutorPool method operating for a bucket, not globally,
it is invoked because externally a request against a bucket for 'task'
stats was requested, any memory allocations happening on this thread
must be attributed to bucket.

The commit removes the memory-tracking disablement on 3 stat gathering
functions, all of which are operating for an engine and not globally.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Discussed already on HipChat with Jim, but for the record there's still a problem if a /different/ engine is deleted while inside doTaskStats, as we'd incorrectly assign the deallocated memory to the running engine.

Maybe look into an explicit onSwitchThread inside VBucketMemoryDeletionTask's dtor so memory is freed under the correct context?
