DESCRIPTION:

MB-32579: Set the TLS engine before deleting a VBucket

The MB highlighted a path where the use of shared_ptrs
meant that the VBucket was deleted on a path which
had set the TLE engine to null (ExecutorPool::doTaskStats).
This can lead to an assert if a VBucket is freed from within
that scope.

Line:44, engines/ep/src/vbucketdeletiontask.cc -> I wonder if we should also enclose the destruction of `description` here - under what context is that allocated?
