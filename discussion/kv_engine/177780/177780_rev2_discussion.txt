DESCRIPTION:

MB-52975: Fold backfill create and scan into one invocation of run

Change from

run1 -> create
run2 -> scan

To

run1 -> create/scan

The reasoning behind this change is because run1/run2 could be separate
by a large amount of time, and the create phase opens the underlying
KVStore.

1) Leaving the snapshot open for the run1->run2 duration and preventing
   the release of disk space.
2) The create phase registers a cursor and when run2 occurs, that
   cursor may know be far behind increasing the risk of cursor dropping
   and another backfill.

Included in this change is a tweak to 'runtime' tracking where when
backfill goes to complete in one run, it ensures that runtime is
not 0 when calculating rates in ActiveStream::completeBackfillInner
