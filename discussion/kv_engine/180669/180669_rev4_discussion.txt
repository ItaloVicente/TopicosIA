DESCRIPTION:

Add bucket metering stats test

We did not have any unit tests for the stats returned from
Bucket::addMeteringMetrics. I've only tested the format of those stats,
but the new test suite should allow us to ensure the correctness of
the returned values in the future.

Line:151, engines/ep/tests/CMakeLists.txt -> Although this is arguably "cleaner" than including thes single daemon/ source file we need, it does bring in a lot more code into ep-engine_ep_unit_tests - which structurally should not depend on the daemon part of kv_engine.

Line:45, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_metering_stats_test.cc -> I don't believe these tests should be doing anything with ep_engine - they are just testing functionality which is part of daemon.

Take a look at memcached_unit_tests - I think that might be a better home for these tests.

Line:45, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_metering_stats_test.cc -> FWIW, metering metrics did previously assume _an_ engine was present for storage_bytes.

I added an `if (hasEngine())` in https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/181288
so a memcached_unit_test level test could indeed test all the non-engine metrics.

Line:45, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_metering_stats_test.cc -> Agreed, the functionality we are testing is not strictly tied to ep-engine. I can move the test to memcached_unit_test. 

We call EPEngine::get_prometheus_stats from within Bucket::addMeteringMetrics. 
`storage` is one of those metrics that I am asserting in the test. That will have to go (or we would need to make sure to create an ep bucket). 

We also don't have MockStatCollector in the memcached tests, so I would have to redefine that there. 

I just did what was easier and required less code duplication.

Line:45, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_metering_stats_test.cc -> Ahh, hmm. That seems like an oversight :disappear: - Seems reasonable to move MockStatCollector out to the memcached level; it's not engine specific
