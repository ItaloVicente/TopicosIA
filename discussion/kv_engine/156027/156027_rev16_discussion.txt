DESCRIPTION:

MB-38476: kv: statically link spdlog using new cbdep

Note the change from 'spdlog' to 'spdlog::spdlog' isn't strictly
required, however it is good practice as a target with '::' in is
considered an external (imported) target and hence if not found in the
build tree will error. (A non-external target which cannot be found
can end up being silently ignored - I forget the exact CMake rules
here...)
