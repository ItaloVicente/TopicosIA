DESCRIPTION:

[1/n] MB-25920: Implement pause-resume capability in sequence list purge

EphTombstoneStaleItemDeleter task can have very long runtimes at both
on average and at tail end. The issue with that is not necessarily the
duration of the task itself; but it will block the other tasks in the
same class (NonIO) from running.

The biggest chunk of work performed by the task is iterating through
the entire sequence list and deleting stale items. This commit
adds capability to pause the tombstone purging while iterating through
the list and to resume purging from the paused point when purge is
called next.

And since purger tasks and snapshotted range read tasks are exclusive,
the snapshotted range reads should not have a problem.

(Periodic pause-resume at the task level will be implemented in the
 following commits)

Line:189, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> I believe you can remove this now?

Line:168, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.h -> Could you also document what the default behaviour is?

Line:179, engines/ep/src/linked_list.h -> Bad idea to re-define default arguments in subclasses - see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rh-virtual-default-arg

Line:189, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> Ok, had just left it as is because in the following commit would have changed it anyways

Line:168, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.h -> Done

Line:179, engines/ep/src/linked_list.h -> Ok, defined it only in the derived class, as I am forced to "an overrider does not inherit default arguments."
