DESCRIPTION:

MB-24765: Split ephemeral tombstone purger into two tasks

Split the existing EphTombstonePurgerTask in two:

1. EphTombstoneHTCleaner task which is responsible for marking old
   tombstones in the HashTable as stale (and removing from HashTable).

2. EphTombstoneStaleItemDeleter task which is responsible for walking
   the SequenceLists and removing stale items.

The reason for this change is that currently the combined
EphTombstonePurgerTask can run for a long time, consuming a NonIO
thread and blocking other tasks from running. To solve this we want to
make purging incremental; so only a small amount of work is done at a
time - similar to the Defragmenter task. To achieve this however the
purging activities need to be migrated to a pause/resume visitor
model, and each iteration (HashTable and SequenceList) will need a
seperate visitor. As such it will be simpler (and easier to measure
their respective runtimes) if the purging work is split into two
tasks.

Line:82, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> Shouldn't this be created independent of EphTombstoneHTCleaner task ? What I mean is, if upper layers decides not create a tombstone purger (say application chooses not to have it), we should still create staleItemDeleterTask.

 (I understand that we currently always create the EphTombstoneHTCleaner task at EphemeralBucket::initialize(), but maybe creating staleItemDeleterTask separately in EphemeralBucket::initialize() gives more flexibility.)

Line:112, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> This can probably run at a higher frequency than the EphTombstoneHTCleaner task.

Line:82, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> I don't believe it's valid to not create an EphTombstoneHTCleaner (you'd run out of memory if you ever deleted anything), so for now I think I'd prefer to keep this creation here - it keeps things simpler from the outside world, as nothing else currently needs to know about this task.

If we later decide to expose the StaleItemDeleter task separately, then we can move it outside then.

Line:112, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> In the sense that other actions can create stale items, yes I agree - however the staleItemDeleter is currently more costly to run than the HTCleaner as it blocks creation of any other RangeRead iterators. 

I think when we allow >1 RangeReadIterator we can revisit this, but for now for simplicity let's just keep them running in pairs at the same time.
