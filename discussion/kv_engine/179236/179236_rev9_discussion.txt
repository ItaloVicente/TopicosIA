DESCRIPTION:

MB-41915: Fix intermittent failure in STItemPagerTest

ActiveEvictedIfReplicaEvictionInsufficient experienced
intermittent failures where the active vBucket was not evicted
from (remained 100% residency ratio).

This was likely due to overpopulation of the replica vBucket
such that its pageableMemory was greater than the watermarkDiff.
Change the ratio from 0.9 to 0.5 to give a larger buffer to
avoid this failure.
