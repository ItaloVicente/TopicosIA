DESCRIPTION:

MB-41915: fix intermittent failure in STItemPagerTest

ActiveEvictedIfReplicaEvictionInsufficient experienced
intermittent failures where the active vBucket was not evicted
from (remained 100% residency ratio).

This was likely due to overpopulation of the replica vBucket
such that its pageableMemory was greater than the watermarkDiff.
Change the ratio from 0.9 to 0.5 to give a larger buffer to
avoid this failure.

Reduce the quota as it does not need to be so high.
This speeds up the test from 9 sec to 300-400ms.
