DESCRIPTION:

MB-54072: Replace literal config string with config::Config

The new configuration builder type helps reduce string duplication and
allows configurations to be extended with new options more easily.

Also had to fix 1 instance where we assumed that the `backend` config
parameter never came first in the config string to get tests to pass.
