DESCRIPTION:

STParameterizedBucketTest: Expand to full-eviction where lacking

A number of test fixtures subclassed off STParameterizedBucketTest do
not currently test persistent buckets in full-eviction mode. This
/appears/ to mostly be an oversight in the original test config, as
they didn't include (persistent, full_eviction) in the set of test
configs.

Where possible, add full-eviction mode to the test combinations. For
some tests this required code changes - typically to explicitly
trigger either flusher (to ensure disk-based item counts are
accurate), or explicilty trigger BgFetcher.

Increases ep-engine_ep_unit_tests total test cases from:

    [----------] Global test environment tear-down
    [==========] 1651 tests from 150 test cases ran. (5603 ms total)
    [  PASSED  ] 1651 tests.

to:

    [----------] Global test environment tear-down
    [==========] 1723 tests from 150 test cases ran. (7829 ms total)
    [  PASSED  ] 1723 tests.
