DESCRIPTION:

Move KVStoreConfig from kvstore.{h,cc} to kvstore_config.{h,cc}

A number of files which currently #include kvstore.h only actually
need the declarion of KVStoreConfig.

Given that kvstore.h is relatively large, move KVStoreConfig to it's
own header / source file to reduce the amount of headers other files
need to include to use it.
