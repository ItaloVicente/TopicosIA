Line:54, cbsasl/CBSASL.md -> Please document why there are multiple elements in the hashes array.

(It's obvious from the context of this patch itself, but future readers may not realise it's due to multiple passwords.

Line:30, cbsasl/client_server_test.cc -> I don't think you should need to specify the type here - an initialiser list should be sufficient.

Line:40, cbsasl/client_server_test.cc -> There's a ctor of std::string from string_view - you can just `return std::string{password}`

Line:225, cbsasl/scram-sha/scram-sha-server.cc -> We don't need std::make_pair in C++17 - an initialiser list is sufficient.

Line:84, cbsasl/scram_password_meta_data.cc -> Would it be simpler to always return an array of hashes, even if there's just one element? Easier for consumer to parse etc.

Line:154, cbsasl/user.cc -> Similar here, shouldn't need std::vector<std::string> here.

Line:191, cbsasl/user.cc -> ditto

Line:517, cbsasl/user.cc -> Similar comment as previously - just always emit the array?
