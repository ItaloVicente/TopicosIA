Line:178, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/backfill_disk_test.cc -> The test seems to perform operations on an active vbucket.. ?

Line:178, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/backfill_disk_test.cc -> Right! The test is poorly named. 

What is being tested is that the vbucket state is held in fetchValidValue during backfill. If the state lock is not being held during fetchValidValue and the state changes after we've checked it but before we delete the expired item, this could lead to inconsistency between replicas and actives.

Context: The original intention of the test was to actually force a deletion after a state change to replica, but I couldn't figure out how to do that without blocking in the success case (because if the state lock is correctly held, trying to setVBucketStateAndRunPersistTask then causes a deadlock). 

I think `testDiskBackfillHoldsVBStateLock` might be a better name for the test.

Line:178, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/backfill_disk_test.cc -> Thanks for clarifying.

I do see that the approach in the test is to verify that we can't acquare a lock from the test, meaning that the prod code is already locking the vbucket at GetValue CacheCallback::get().

> The original intention of the test was to actually force a deletion after a state change to replica, but I couldn't figure out how to do that without blocking in the success case (because if the state lock is correctly held, trying to setVBucketStateAndRunPersistTask then causes a deadlock). 

Mmm I was indeed asking why don't we cover the "symptom" of the issue in the test - ie, that we can end up expiring a doc in a replica vbucket.
