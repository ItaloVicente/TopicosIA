DESCRIPTION:

MB-27122: [2/2] Do not initialise the current manifest

As described in the MB, it is risky to initialise the current manifest
to a 'default' state. It is safer to run without a manifest as we
really should only operate on what the cluster_manager tells us.

This leads to one situation in DcpOpen where we must fail the open
if the manifest hasn't yet been set, this situation is now flagged
by a new error code "no_collections_manifest" allowing what should
be a temporary failure (cluster manager should always push a manifest)
to be observed.
