DESCRIPTION:

MB-41257: Don't enable traffic if Warmup can't write vb state to disk

Currently during warmup we will try and persist a new vbucket state to
disk during Warmup::populateVBucketMap(). This is to ensure we write any
new failover uuid to disk before we add the vbucket to vbucket map
(allowing us to accept DCP connections). This gives us a good place to
ensure that we can write to the files of a vbucket or not, to ensure our
storage is in a good state. However, currently we don't take advantage
of this. Waiting for the flusher task to persist the state to disk
without reporting its success.

To help ensure we don't try and use vbuckets that we can't reliably
read/write to. We have modified the Warmup::populateVBucketMap() to call
the flush of the vbucket state to disk immediately after enqueuing it in
the checkpoint manager. Then based on the success of the flush of the
vbucket state we will add the vbucket to the vbucket map so that it can
be access by DCP. We will also set a flag, if the flush fails to ensure
we don't accept any front end ops if it fails. This is to ensure we
don't accept writes that we will be unable to persist to disk.

To enable this change this patch adds a success flag to
EPBucket::FlushResult, so that EPBucket::flushVBucket() can explicitly
state if it failed or succeeded and Warmup::populateVBucketMap() can
make a decision based on this. We also introduced an unlocked version
of EPBucket::flushVBucket() so that Warmup::populateVBucketMap() can
call the flush functionality as we take a vbucket lock before enqueuing
the vbucket state in the checkpoint manager.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: technically it may not have been flushed before we add it to the vBucket map/allow DCP connections. Flusher will be scheduled/notified but may not have run.

Line:275, engines/ep/src/flusher.cc -> EPBucket::flushVBucket() doesn't log specifically on failure itself so up to a respective KV store. Though there are other reason the flusher might fail that are not KVStore related e.g. no valid vbucket or vbucket log.

Line:275, engines/ep/src/flusher.cc -> Unsuccessful commits get logged in EPBucket::commit http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/kv_engine/engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc#900-918. Unsuccessful snapshotVBucketState calls (if we only update vbstate) are not. Could you just add the logging around snapshotVBucketState and then we won't double log on commit failures. Saves adding another status bool too.

Line:1301, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Spoke to DaveR about this abit, and if we were do go down the route of waiting for the flusher task to do it and block with a call back I think it would end up requiring far more plumbing than just calling it directly.

Line:1316, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Failure here means not putting the vBucket in the map which means gets won't work. I don't think that's desirable as currently I believe we can come up in a sort of read only state should we be able to read from but not write to disk. Do we want to prevent that behaviour?

Line:1316, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Please correct me if I'm wrong but I don't believe that gets check if traffic is enabled at all so in this kind of scenario this would have worked in the past. I think not streaming is fine in this case but read only access could be useful.

Line:1316, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> I've re-checked the code and you're correct we only check the traffic enabled status for gets if the get doesn't succeed. So we would be able to try and read keys if we had disabled enabled traffic. I'll modify comment to reflect this.

Line:1316, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> As we're not enabling traffic due to the failure to prevent sets, gets won't work eatheir. Though by not adding the vbucket to the map we won't be able to stream to replica's that might be trying to reconnect. However, in the make data files read only, then memcached situation this is probably desirable as it means that if the replica persisted more mutations that were generated between the write failure and the crash that we wouldn't lose this data and could then promote it.
