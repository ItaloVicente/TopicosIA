DESCRIPTION:

MB-41257: Don't enable traffic if Warmup can't write vb state to disk

Currently during warmup we will try and persist a new vbucket state to
disk during Warmup::populateVBucketMap(). This is to ensure we enqueue
any new failover uuid in the checkpoint manager, before we add the
vbucket to vbucket map (allowing us to accept DCP connections). So its
the first thing that written to disk. This gives us a good place to
ensure that we can write to the files of a vbucket or not, to ensure
our storage is in a good state. However, currently we don't take
advantage of this. Waiting for the flusher task to persist the state
to disk without reporting its success.

To help ensure we don't try and use vbuckets that we can't reliably
read/write to. We have modified the Warmup::populateVBucketMap() to call
the flush of the vbucket state to disk immediately after enqueuing it in
the checkpoint manager. Then based on the success of the flush of the
vbucket state we will add the vbucket to the vbucket map so that it can
be access by DCP. We will also set a flag, if the flush fails to ensure
we don't accept any front end ops if it fails. This is to ensure we
don't accept writes that we will be unable to persist to disk.

To enable this change this patch adds a success flag to
EPBucket::FlushResult, so that EPBucket::flushVBucket() can explicitly
state if it failed or succeeded and Warmup::populateVBucketMap() can
make a decision based on this. We also introduced an unlocked version
of EPBucket::flushVBucket() so that Warmup::populateVBucketMap() can
call the flush functionality as we take a vbucket lock before enqueuing
the vbucket state in the checkpoint manager.
