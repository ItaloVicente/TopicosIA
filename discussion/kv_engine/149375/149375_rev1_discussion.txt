DESCRIPTION:

Don't reset cursors if no checkpoint created in CM::createSnapshot

CM::resetCursor repositions cursors at CheckpointList::begin and updates
the accounting of cursor in checkpoints after a CheckpointList change.

There is no reason for making the call in code paths that don't modify
the CheckpointList.

The call removed was the only one passing 'resetPersistenceCursor =
false' at resetCursor(), so the argument is removed.
