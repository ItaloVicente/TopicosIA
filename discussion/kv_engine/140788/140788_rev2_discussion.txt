DESCRIPTION:

MB-42780: Logically revert MB-41283

Merging Disk snapshots was a precondition for hitting MB-41283.
The core fix for MB-42780 avoids that by changing how replica processes
incoming Snapshot Markers, so the code added for MB-41283 can be
removed.

This patch adds stricter checks to ensure that the CheckpointManager
itself doesn't allow merging Disk snapshots. Tests are updated
accordingly.
