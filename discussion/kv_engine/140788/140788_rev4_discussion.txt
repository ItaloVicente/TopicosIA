DESCRIPTION:

MB-42780: Logically revert MB-41283

Merging Disk snapshots was a precondition for hitting MB-41283.
The core fix for MB-42780 avoids that by changing how replica processes
incoming Snapshot Markers, so the code added for MB-41283 can be
removed.

Note: This patch is removing old tests introduced in MB-41283, but a
follow-up patch will add some sanity checks in CheckpointManager
preventing for preventing any illegal snapshot-merge, complete of new
test coverage.

Line:2986, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Doesn't leaving in these tests keep test coverage till you add/modify new tests in a new patch as described in the commit message?

Line:103, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Keeping the -1, pushing a new patchset

Line:2986, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Since when we avoided merging of Disk snapshots at PassiveStream, essentially these tests don't cover anything useful (as they are setting up a scenario that doesn't happen in the production code).

With the next patch the CM will throw if the caller tries to merge Disk snapshots. Originally that additional validation in CM was here, but that fails a bunch of tests that still use the CM API "incorrectly". So I decided to defer the new CM-throw to a dedicated patch.
