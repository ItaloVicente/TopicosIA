DESCRIPTION:

MB-42780: Logically revert MB-41283

Merging Disk snapshots was a precondition for hitting MB-41283.
The core fix for MB-42780 avoids that by changing how replica processes
incoming Snapshot Markers, so the code added for MB-41283 can be
removed.

Note: This patch is removing old tests introduced in MB-41283, but a
follow-up patch will add some sanity checks in CheckpointManager
preventing for preventing any illegal snapshot-merge, complete of new
test coverage.
