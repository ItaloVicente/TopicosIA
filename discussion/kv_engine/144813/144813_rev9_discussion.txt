DESCRIPTION:

MB-44002: Move manipulation of session counter to core

The use of the session counter (and its cas) originates to when the
core didn't know anything about the underlying engines types. With
all of the refactoring we've done with the engines (squashing all
of the repos so that all bucket types commands are known to the core)
it is easier to perform the session check in the core and have it
clean up the data as part of the command lifecycle.
