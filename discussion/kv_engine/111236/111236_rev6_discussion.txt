DESCRIPTION:

Use non-recursive shared lock for Manifest::rwlock

Currently VB::Manifest::rwlock uses cb::RWLock for the shared
lock. This is implemented using pthread_rwlock underneath, which is
(implicitly) a recursive mutex.

We don't actually require a recursive mutex for VB::Manifest::rwlock
(a thread shouldn't attempt to read-lock it twice), so to avoid any
potential bugs where we lock too many times change to use a
non-recursive mutex.

The chosen mutex is (initially) std::shared_mutex given it's the
simplest to drop in instead of RWLock. However we could consider using
folly::SharedMutex instead which is expected to be more performant
when being locked in shared mode (as is the common case for
VB::Manifest).
