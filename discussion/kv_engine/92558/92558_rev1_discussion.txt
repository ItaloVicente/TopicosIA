DESCRIPTION:

MB-29184: Improve log message for slow BackfillManagerTask runtime

We log all the useful information (vbid, startSeqno, endSeqno) when we
schedule a backfill, e.g.:

.. (vb 102) Scheduling backfill from 1 to 15650692 ..

But, we do not do the same when we log a slow backfill, e.g.:

.. Slow runtime for 'Backfilling items for a DCP Connection' on thread
    auxIO_worker_1: 2676 ms

It would be useful to have the backfill details for slow backfills, so
with this change we produce the following slow-backfill output:

.. Slow runtime for 'Backfilling items for a DCP Connection, vbid:1,
    startSeqno:1, endSeqno:53392' on thread auxIO_worker_0: 4104 ms
