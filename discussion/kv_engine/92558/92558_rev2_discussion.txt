DESCRIPTION:

MB-29184: Improve log message for slow BackfillManagerTask runtime

We log all the useful information (vbid, startSeqno, endSeqno) when we
schedule a backfill, e.g.:

.. (vb 102) Scheduling backfill from 1 to 15650692 ..

But, we do not do the same when we log a slow backfill, e.g.:

.. Slow runtime for 'Backfilling items for a DCP Connection' on thread
    auxIO_worker_1: 2676 ms

It would be useful to have the backfill details for slow backfills, so
with this change we produce the following slow-backfill output:

.. Slow runtime for 'Backfilling items for a DCP Connection, vbid:1,
    startSeqno:1, endSeqno:53392' on thread auxIO_worker_0: 4104 ms

Line:121, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill-manager.cc -> Be careful here - this method is called extremely frequently (every time the task is scheduled). You may well see a performance degradation if you're performing all this memory allocation - that's why most tasks pre-calculate the description.

Line:121, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill-manager.cc -> Ok, I missed to re-check that (I assumed the method to be called only if we have as slow runtime, which is wrong).
Do you think that a solution where I pre-size a buffer and then I 'memcpy' into the buffer would be acceptable? In that case there would be no memory allocation at all here.

Line:121, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill-manager.cc -> The simplest solution is to just update the description once each time run() is called -however technically that will be sightly wrong as the description is read just before we run() the task (it's used to populate the recent / slow task log).

TBH I'm not quite sure if this is the best approach - we can already see backfills slow from the difference between when we start and when they finish (which IIRC we log both events). Is that not sufficient?

Line:121, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill-manager.cc -> We do log the Begin and End event for the BackFillManagerTask with Phosphor, but we do not have any stream detail. 
So essentially on logs we have a long list of scheduled Backfills, but we do not know the VBucket, StartSeqno, EndSeqno for a slow BackFillManagerTask.

Line:80, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill-manager.cc -> Style: given the constructor doesn't do anything else; prefer in-class member initialisers: http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-default

Line:121, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill-manager.cc -> Ok. Let's go with the approach you have for now - backfill doesn't run that often, and it's a relatively slow task, so I hope the cost of this isn't that high. We can adjust if necessary later.

Line:70, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill.h -> These should be uint64_t

Line:79, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill.h -> These should be uint64_t
