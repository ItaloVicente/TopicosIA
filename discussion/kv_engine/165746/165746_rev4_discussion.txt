DESCRIPTION:

MB-49525: Reduce defragmenter scoring for low hash-table usage

Compute what we think is the size of memory that the defragmenter can
affect, that is the total StoredValue and Blob usage combined. Then
compute a ratio of that from the real bucket allocated size.

Thus if all bucket allocated was StoredValue and Blob usage, we compute
a value of 1.0, and a value of 0.0 if there's no memory the
defragmenter can affect.

Use that value and multiply our current fragmentation ratio to obtain
the value for feeding into the PID (or linear) auto configuration.

This means in cases where the fragmentation may appear high, but the
hash table memory is small, the defragmenter will stay steady or see
reduced increases in aggression.

For the issue (approx memory usage values in Mb):

Resident       215
Allocated      168
Defraggable    78
Num StoredVals 223,149

Before 0.22

After  0.011

0.22 * (78/168) * (223,149/2,000,000) = 0.01139653821

This is below the lower-threshold of 0.07, leaving the defragger in
default config, and should of visited all of the items in 37 seconds.
