DESCRIPTION:

MB-32653: Request new RBAC entries from after RbacRefresh

It should be possible to "invalidate" the RBAC cache used for
users connected via LDAP. We can't simply drop the RBAC
database as that would cause all of the users to be disconnected
(as they wouldn't have access to the current bucket etc).

To work around this we have to be a bit creative and "invalidate"
the cache in multiple steps:

   1) The external auth provider send RbacRefresh

      We reload the local RBAC database file, and once we're
      done we set a "maximum rbac cache age" to the current time.
      Every time someone tries to log in (for LDAP) we compare
      that the timestamp of the cached RBAC entry (if we have
      one) is newer than that. Otherwise we'll request a new
      RBAC entry.

      This logic makes sure that we request new RBAC entries
      for all users logging in.

   2) In order to deal with the currently connected users we
      have to rely on the external auth provider to look at
      the list of active users we push, and send updates for
      all of the users it finds in there.
