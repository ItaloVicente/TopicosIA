DESCRIPTION:

MB-26255[4]: Add stat for total data size to be sent over the wire

Add a stat for total_data_size. This should be the number of bytes
that needs to be sent over the wire. This is different from the
total bytes sent stat which could be a lot less if compression
is enabled.

Line:613, engines/ep/docs/stats.org -> Maybe make this description / the name more explicit - "should have been sent" implies to me that it should equal `total_bytes_sent`.

Maybe `total_uncompressed_data_size` - or something shorter if you can think of something.

Line:551, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> I think these are redundant now, given you check the size of the compressed body below.

Line:578, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Lot of code repetition here. Can you try to restructure it so we don't have to repeat this?

Line:118, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> Please add a comment to this, or rename the funtion/ variable to be more self-explanatory.

Line:551, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> I believe I will still need them for the buffer acknowledgement in lines 559-560 and for accurately calculating the total bytes sent in the case of compression.
