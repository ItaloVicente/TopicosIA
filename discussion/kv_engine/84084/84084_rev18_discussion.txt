DESCRIPTION:

MB-26255[4]: Add stat for total data size to be sent over the wire

Add a stat for total_data_size. This should be the number of bytes
that needs to be sent over the wire. This is different from the
total bytes sent stat which could be a lot less if compression
is enabled.

Line:576, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> I think this is a pretty hacky solution - it makes the code even harder to follow (and it's non-intuitive that we initially claim we are going to add N bytes, then add <N. Additionally, you need to verify this works correctly if the first add has caused the connection to be paused.

Can you investigate what we need to do to implement this cleanly - i.e. issue one call to bufferLog per request, with the correct size in it. Feel free to break out the statistic-only change (adding the new compressed size stat) and merge that by itself while we figure out a clean solution to this.

Line:120, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> Can be const.

Line:188, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> Can be const.
