DESCRIPTION:

MB-34217: Magma support for dropping collections with SyncWrites

This requires the fixing of two issues.

1) We need to purge the prepare namespace before the collections
instead of after them or we will have dropped the required collections
metadata and won't attempt to drop prepares in the dropped collections.

2) MB-39458: Correct the tracking of prepares when doing a collection
dropping compaction.
