DESCRIPTION:

MB-43300: Don't iterate all collections when getting the stats of one

A cmd_stat call which requests the 'summary' stats of one collection
is building a copy of the stats for every collection. If the system
is configured with many collection (e.g. 1000) a request for 1
collection becomes measurably slow (as per the MB report). The majority
of the cost is inside vbucket visiting, where for every active vbucket
we do unordered_map lookups and inserts for every collection.

This patch re-factors the one-collection and scope stats "summary"
code, that is the handler for cmd_stat:

* collections <name>
* collections-byid id
* scopes <name>
* scopes-byid id

The refactoring means one visitor can more efficiently gather stats
for all of those case by using a vector of CollectionEntry objects
which selects the set of collections to visit. In the one-collection
case we have a vector with one entry, and in the scope case we have
just the collections that belong to the scope, in both cases the
visitor never has to operate on the entire collection set, just
the collections in the input vector.

A simple timing exercise was done using mc_bin_client to drive
cmd_stat collections-byid to measure n iterations of the command
before and after this patch, 1,000 collections were instantiated
on a 2 node cluster.

n    | time before (seconds) | time after (seconds)
1    | 0.0077                | 0.0008
10   | 0.0765                | 0.0056
100  | 0.7713                | 0.0636
1000 | 7.7914                | 0.6801
