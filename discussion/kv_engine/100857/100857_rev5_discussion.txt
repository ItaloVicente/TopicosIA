DESCRIPTION:

MB-31704: Add collection locking on expiry path

A collection manifest readhandle must be obtained before creating
mutations in the checkpoint, only if the collection exists can we go
ahead and create the expired item.

This patch requires that the CachingReadHandle is pushed a little
deeper into the vbucket checkpoint update path, this is to allow
future patches access to the collection entry from queueDirty
