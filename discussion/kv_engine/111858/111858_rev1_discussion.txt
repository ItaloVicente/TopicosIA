DESCRIPTION:

MB-34946: Use HashTable::FindCommitResult in processSoftDelete

In a following change, we need to make use of the FindCommitResult
in VBucket::processSoftDelete as it contains both the pending and
committed StoredValues. To keep a single processSoftDelete
interface, update all callers to pass a FindCommitResult instead of
a single StoredValue&.
