DESCRIPTION:

MB-29333: Decay frequency for items considered for eviction

The issue is we are unable to evict when there is only one document in
a vbucket.

The hifi_mfu algorithm will currently only evict the first document it
visits if its execution frequency count is zero.  But documents are
initially added with an initialFreqCount of 4.

Therefore the solution is to decrement a document's frequncy count
when it its considered for eviction.  Therefore after sufficient
multiple passes of running the hifi_mfu algorithm the document will be
evicted.
