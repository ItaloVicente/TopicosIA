DESCRIPTION:

MB-47462: Ensure Checkpoint does not access CM after removal

Once removed from the CheckpointManager, it is desirable that
Checkpoints do not reference anything from the CM. This avoids issues
if the Checkpoint outlives the CM.

This is not currently an issue, but future patches may allow
Checkpoints to outlive the CheckpointManager.
