DESCRIPTION:

MB-47462: Ensure ~Checkpoint does not access destroyed CM

memOverheadChangedCallback is owned by the CheckpointManager, and is
used to update stats which track changes in overhead.

As future patches may allow Checkpoints to very slightly outlive the
CheckpointManager, avoid calling this in ~Checkpoint.
