DESCRIPTION:

MB-31481: Force notifyStreamReady in 'InMemory' stream closure case

When a backfill is activated along with a slow stream trigger,
the stream end message gets stuck in the readyQ as the stream is
never notified as ready to send it. As the stream transitions state
to InMemory as well as having sent all requested sequence numbers,
the stream is meant to end but Stream::itemsReady can cause this
to never trigger. This means that DCP consumers can hang waiting
for this closure message.

This patch sets force to true inside notifyStreamReady when triggered
from InMemory and intending on ending the stream. This ensures that
the stream is notified no matter what the itemsReady flag is set to.
The patch also includes a test to follow this problematic sequence.
