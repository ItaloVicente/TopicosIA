DESCRIPTION:

MB-31481: Trigger nextQueuedItem after pendingBackfill has been scheduled

When a backfill is activated along with a slow stream trigger,
the stream end message gets stuck in the readyQ as the stream is
never notified as ready to send it. As the stream transitions state
to InMemory as well as having sent all requested sequence numbers,
the stream is meant to end but Stream::itemsReady can cause this
to never trigger. This means that DCP consumers can hang waiting
for this closure message.

This patch triggers nextQueuedItem inside the pendingBackfill case to
ensure that the end stream message is noticed and executed.
The patch also includes a test to follow this problematic sequence.

Fix looks good - just some suggestions for the test / description:
Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could you tweak this description a bit? I think we now have a more accurate understanding of the original bug - that it wasn't sent because we broke the expectation of next() - returning null means itemsReady is false.

Line:3512, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Worth flipping this to ASSERT_ given this is checking a precondition of the test setup.

Line:3542, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Ditto

Line:3556, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Same for all these - flip to ASSERT to distinguish the setup phase from the actual functionality under test.
