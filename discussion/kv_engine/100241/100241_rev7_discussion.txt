DESCRIPTION:

MB-31481: Don't skip STREAM_END msg after cursor drop during backfill

For DCP producers needing backfill, There's an edge-case in handling
cursor dropping:

- When a backfill is re-scheduled due to a slow stream trigger (cursor
  dropping), if the second backfill isn't necessary (as the required
  items are still in the checkpoing manager) then the second backfill
  is skipped and the stream transition to in-memory.  - If the
  in-memory stream then doesn't need to fetch anymore data (as no more
  mutations have occurred), then the stream advances directly to
  endStream - see ActiveStream::transitionState():

      case StreamState::InMemory:
          // Check if the producer has sent up till the last requested
          // sequence number already, if not - move checkpoint items into
          // the ready queue.
          if (lastSentSeqno.load() >= end_seqno_) {
              // Stream transitioning to DEAD state
              endStream(END_STREAM_OK);         /// <--- HERE
              notifyStreamReady();
          }

However, there is a bug where this END_STREAM message is never
transmitted to the DCP client, resulting in the stream hanging.

The problem is that stream end message gets stuck in the readyQ, as
the stream is never notified as ready to send it. This is due to the
expectation of Stream::next() dealing with queued items being broken -
if next() retuns null then the itemsReady flag is cleared as it
assumes a null retudn means no more items are available.  However in
this situation there /are/ items ready, but not until
transitionState() is called.

Following from this, the stream is never notified so doesnt
send a closure message, which means that DCP consumers can hang
waiting for this closure message.

This patch triggers nextQueuedItem inside the pendingBackfill case to
ensure that the end stream message is notified and executed.  The
patch also includes a test to follow this problematic sequence.
