DESCRIPTION:

MB-55958: Item's with no value should have no datatype (raw 0)

When creating an item with no value do not copy the datatype, this
covers the broadest amount of code paths rather than a targetted fix
just for StoredValue::toItemAbort (as per the MB). Code review confirms
that other usage of toItemInfo with the NoValue option does not expect
the datatype, including DCP's "key only + underlying datatype" mode.

For context, the "key only + underlying datatype" does not request
Item's with no value from the hash-table, this can be checked by
looking at the usage of getInternal from CacheCallback and comments
also in ActiveStream::isKeyOnly.

Additionally MagmaKVStore is changed to only check for valid items
after the Item operation type is updated to abort/prepare. This was
some source of confusion in the MB where the problematic abort was
logged as a normal looking delete.

Note: This commit was originally intended to be submitted with the
following change in CheckpointManager::queueDirty

 #if CB_DEVELOPMENT_ASSERTS
    if (qi->isDeleted() && qi->getNBytes() == 0 &&
        qi->getDataType() != PROTOCOL_BINARY_RAW_BYTES) {
        throw std::invalid_argument(fmt::format(
                ".some error. {}", *qi));
    }
 #endif

Which lead to the code in kv_bucket_test.cc to ensure we don't use the
low level API's to violate that assert. However the test function
testSanitizeOnDiskDeletedDocWithIncorrectXATTR requires to violate that
condition, so for now the exception is removed.

Line:313, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> Possibly as a follow-up - how feasible would it be to make `getDataType()` return an std::optional - so we could be sure we don't try to read it when it is unknown (there is no value)?

Line:313, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> A lot of churn on that - a quick search and we have many callers that would need to change to test the returned type. It certainly would be a nicer API

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:313, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> Nod. Perhaps open a quick MB to track this idea? (might be a nice kv-101 / kv-goodness change...)
