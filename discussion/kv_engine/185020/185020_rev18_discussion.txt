DESCRIPTION:

MB-54729: CDC stream backfill with a dropped collection

Primarily add a test that includes a dropped collection in the
scanned history range. This highlighted a problem in the collections
ScanContext as with history enabled the scanAllVersions method will
return both the create and drop of a collection as separate system
events. The isLogicallyDeleted code now needs to be able to distinguish
the create and drop collection events so that a backfill can exclude
the create event if the collection is dropped.
