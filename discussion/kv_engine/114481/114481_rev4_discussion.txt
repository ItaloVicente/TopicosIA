DESCRIPTION:

MB-34280: Set max DCP name to 200 characters

The DCP name can only be 200 characters to avoid too long
keys to be returned in the response.

Also add a check that noone tries to create a DCP
stat name longer than 47 bytes (there is 8 bytes
overhead with "eq_dcpq:" followed by a ":" after the
DCP name.
