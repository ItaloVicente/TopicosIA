DESCRIPTION:

MB-39594: Only call get_scope_id if we need to

Currently all incoming operations result in a get_scope_id
call so that scope/collection privileges can be checked.

However if the connection only has bucket privileges defined
this lookup (and cost per operation) is not required.

Change-Id: I5488d1460cdcb02a3e066432ff652a0d237b335d
