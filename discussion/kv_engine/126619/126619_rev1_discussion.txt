DESCRIPTION:

MB-38856: Handle dropping sync-writes from ephemeral buckets

The previous code that dropped a key was not handling the case
where a pending and committed item both exist (an ephemeral only
case). The code was leading to a pointer to freed memory being left
in the hash-table leading to various crashes.

Note that this MB does not fully address or test sync-writes and
collection drops which is tracked under MB-34217.

Line:935, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> It seems that we miss to cleanup the DurabilityMonitor (which is still tracking the Prepare after this call).
I think that here we should behave as described in MB-34217 for the EP case.

Line:580, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_eraser_test.cc -> It seems like we miss post-conditions in this test.. ie, this test seems to succeed even before the fix?
Shouldn't we check that both Committed and Prepare (if any) have been removed from the HT and from the DurabilityMonitor?

Line:935, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> In this fix/MB i'm not trying to resolve any of the issues of MB-34217 - i'm happy for sync writes to not behave properly under a collection drop - however i don't want the nodes to crash which is what this is fixing. MB-34217 will address clean up in the DM

Line:580, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_eraser_test.cc -> The MB is about a segmentation fault - if you take out the fix, this test crashes, with the fix it doesn't. I can certainly extend the checks for the hash-table as that's all we're doing here - DurabilityMonitor changes are not part of this MB

Line:580, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_eraser_test.cc -> Got it, yeah a check on the final content of the HT would be nice

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> this is actually also a case for EPBuckets where the prepare is newer than the (older) committed item. The difference for ephemeral buckets is that they keep completed prepares (until a new one comes along).
