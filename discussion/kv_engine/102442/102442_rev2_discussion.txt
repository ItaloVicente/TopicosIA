DESCRIPTION:

MB-31810: HashTableVisitors HashBucketLock wrapping functions

To implement an in memory collection high seqno we need to set a
variable that will be stored in a Collections ManifestEntry on
every new high senqo for that particular collection. To do so, we
must wrap every operation that may update the high seqno in a
Collections::VB::Manifest::ReadHandle/CachingReadHandle. We should do
so before acquiring any HashBucketLocks to minimise HashTable
contention and abort operations early on non-valid collections.

This presents an interesting case for Ephemeral buckets as the
pageOut() function can modify a collection high seqno (we update the
high seqno on deletion of an item). To prevent lock order inversions
we still need to acquire a Collections::VB::Manifest::ReadHandle
before we acquire the HashBucketLock. As the HashTableVisitors iterate
over HashBuckets and only acquire a HashBucketLock once (at the start
of iteration) we need to modify HashTable::pauseResumeVisit to allow
us to take aquire a Collections::VB::Manifest::ReadHandle lock before
doing so, and dispose of it after the HashBucketLock.

To implement this functionality with requiring that every
HashTableVisitor locks HashBucket visits in a
Collections::VB::Manifest::ReadHandle we can introduce two virtual
functions that a HashTableVisitor can override. These functions,
setUp and tearDown, will allow a visitor to set any required state
or acquire any locks before the HashBucketLock is acquired, and then
dispose of them appropriately after the HashBucketLock has been released.

Currently the PagingVisitor does not use the added readHandle, it was
added to demonstrate functionality, but the use will be added in a
following patch.

Line:411, engines/ep/src/paging_visitor.cc -> Note you're forcing a memory-allocation here (make_unique). Is it possible to have an empty ReadHandle object (which doesn't own anything) - if so that would be more efficient.

Line:20, engines/ep/src/paging_visitor.h -> Given the ReadHandle is inside a unique_ptr it should be possible to forward-declare instead.

Line:89, engines/ep/src/paging_visitor.h -> Probably worth documenting why these are needed, esp given the default implementation is empty.

Line:411, engines/ep/src/paging_visitor.cc -> Done with the addition of the ability to lock and unlock the lock inside the ReadHandle

Line:20, engines/ep/src/paging_visitor.h -> I thought so too, but because ReadHandle is declared inside Manifest the only fwd declare that works in this file appears to be

... omitted namespaces
namespace Manifest {
class ReadHandle;
}
... omitted namespaces

however this throws up errors when I redeclare Manifest as a class in other files.

Not sure if this is possible in a way I don't know about. Perhaps ReadHandle should be declared outside Manifest.

Line:89, engines/ep/src/paging_visitor.h -> Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:411, engines/ep/src/paging_visitor.cc -> Not sure if this is that clean - we are keeping an RAII object around for a longer duration in a potentially locked / unlocked form...

I was more thing you change the unique_ptr-managed ReadHandle to a concrete one (which would need it to be default-constructible in the unlocked state); then keep the previous code you had where you'd assign the ReadHandle in setUpHashBucketVisit() / call reset() in tearDown.
