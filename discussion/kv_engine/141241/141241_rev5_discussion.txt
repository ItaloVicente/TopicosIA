Line:49, daemon/mcbpdestroybuckettask.h -> Style: Can just do `if (cookie)` - see https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-if

Line:62, daemon/thread.cc -> This seems bad - we should at least log if this occurs...

Line:338, daemon/thread.cc -> Feels like this should be logged as an error?

Line:348, daemon/thread.cc -> Same

Line:62, daemon/thread.cc -> So this isn't really related to _this_ patch, but:

This method used to be called from:

1) when we want to notify idle connections (bucket deletion for instance). 
2) worker threads in ep-engine trying to get a DCP connection to call step again.

Both of these won't run in the context of the front end worker thread so letting the method throw the bad alloc would most likely terminate the program. For bucket deletion for instance it will retry the operation.

That being said, I'm pretty sure there is multiple places in the code we don't handle bad_alloc being thrown which will result in undefined behavior in our system (memory being leaked, file handles being lost or even the exception not being caught causing the process to die). I'd rather not do anything about this with this patch as it isn't really related to what the patch is trying to do. Eventually this list should also move over to the folly queue.

Line:62, daemon/thread.cc -> So the motivation behind not adding any logging here (back at the time) was that if we failed to grow the notification array to keep the pointer we would most likely also fail to generate the log entry. (That is of course probably not really true as growing here would require more available continuous space than the size of the current array as we need to do a full realloc to grow it unless there is free space after the current size)

Line:62, daemon/thread.cc -> Sure, it's not part of your change here, but the review highlighted it ;)

std::bad_alloc should be rare / non-existent on Linux (you normally get OOM-killed beforehand!) but _if_ it did happen, simply ignoring it is probably the worst of all options - in the unlikely event it was simply a transient std::bad_alloc, I believe we could end up stuck (if a thread was never notified).

If this is going away soon then I don't think there's any action needed here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:62, daemon/thread.cc -> I think we should just remove the try and let the exception propagate up - if it _did_ throw then we probably need to shutdown that connection - or maybe that's fatal?
