DESCRIPTION:

MB-29675: Cache is{Snappy,ForceValueCompression}Enabled in ActiveStream

makeResponseFromItem is called for every item to be sent out over DCP;
and it shows up high in 'linux perf' profiles (approx 6% of AuxIO
threads). The bulk of the cost is actually checking if the given
stream supports Snappy, and if all items should be focrcefully
compressed.

This cost comes from both isSnappyEnabled &
isForceValueCompressionEnabled() having to promote the producer
weak_ptr to a shared_ptr to check the relevent producer flag (and then
delete the shared_ptr).

Optimise this by simply caching the value of snappyEnabled /
forceValueCompression in the ActiveStream object at construction time,
and checking the local flag. We don't support changing either of these
flags dynamically for a stream, so this is safe - and avoids all the
shared_ptr manipulation.

With these changes makeResponseFromItem drops to less than 1% of AuxIO
threads.
