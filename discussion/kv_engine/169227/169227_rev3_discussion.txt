DESCRIPTION:

MB-50389: Replace compaction_write_queue_cap with compaction_max_concurrent_ratio

Introduce a new configuration setting 'compaction_max_concurrent_ratio':

    Maximum number of CompactVBucketTask tasks which can run
    concurrently, as a fraction of the possible Writer task
    concurrency. Note that a minimum of 1, and a maximum of N-1
    CompactVBucketTasks will be run (where N is the possible Writer
    task concurrency), to ensure both forward progress for Compaction
    and Flushing.

Previously the compaction tasl concurrency was limited to 50% (fixed
fraction) of possible Writer tasks, _if_ the disk queue size exceeded
compaction_write_queue_cap:

    Disk write queue threshold after which compaction tasks will be
    made to snooze, if there are already pending compaction tasks.
    Default: 10,000.

The intent of compaction_write_queue_cap is that if a Bucket has
sufficient outstanding disk writes, then we should limit the number of
compaction tasks to avoid consuming all Writer threads, leaving too
little capacity for Flusher tasks.

Conceptually this reasonable, however this code dates back a long way
- before SyncWrites, and before we were as focused on the latency of
accessing documents on disk.

Looking at compaction_write_queue_cap from the pov of the current
state of KV-Engine, there are a couple of flaws:

 (a) While we check the outstanding writes when compaction starts,
     more writes could come in during compaction but will be blocked /
     will be contending for disk IO with already running compaction.

 (b) Even if the queue size is very small (1 even), compactor tasks
     consuming all Writer threads means SyncWrites could be blocked
     from being flushed at all - significantly impacting SyncWrite
     latency.

While it would be "nice" to be able to utilise all Writer threads for
Compaction if they are not needed for Flusher tasks, ultimately it is
_never_ safe to use "too many" Writer threads for compaction, as
mutations (SyncWrites) either in progress or yet to start could be
blocked from progressing.

As such, remove compaction_write_queue_cap from the calculation of
when to pause additional Compactor tasks, and always limit to some
fraction of the possible Writer tasks. This fraction is controlled by
the new param compaction_max_concurrent_ratio which defaults to 0.5 -
i.e. the same fraction as we limited previously.
