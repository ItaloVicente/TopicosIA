DESCRIPTION:

MB-50988: Introduce SemaphoreBoundedTask

Some tasks need to be able to limit how many instances run
concurrently, like CompactTask.

Add SemaphoreBoundedTask to allow task concurrency to be limited by a
cb::AwaitableSemaphore.

If multiple tasks share a semaphore, the number of these tasks running
at a given time is limited by the capacity of the semaphore.

If no semaphore tokens are available, the task will snooze().

cb::AwaitableSemaphore maintains a queue of waiters, and will notify
"blocked" tasks when tokens become available. The task will then try to
acquire a token and run immediately.

This is not currently transparent to the task - it is required that the
task call:

  bool runInner() override {
     auto guard = acquireOrWait();
     if (!guard) {
         // could not acquire a token, queued for notification.
         // already snooze()-ed forever, just return true to
         // reschedule.
         return true;
     }
     // Do concurrency-limited work
  }

However, a future refactor could avoid this by, for example,
restructuring as a mixin

 SemaphoreBounded<SomeTask> task(semaphore, ...);

allowing any `SomeTask::run()` to be wrapped.

This would allow any task to be bounded by a semaphore if necessary,
without modification.

Line:16, engines/ep/src/semaphore_bounded_task.cc -> Do we need sleeptime here? If we can avoid this and just make it initially sleep forever (which I think most tasks do, and then get scheduled / snoozed shortly after) I think that gives a simpler interface.

Line:18, engines/ep/src/semaphore_bounded_task.h -> I think this is a poor name for a generic class - it reflects _how_ the class if implemented (Semaphore), but not explicitly what it does.

Consider something like "MeteredTask", "LimitedConcurrencyTask", ...

Line:18, engines/ep/src/semaphore_bounded_task.h -> Please document the class - maybe c/p some of the commit message here?

Line:20, engines/ep/src/semaphore_bounded_task.h -> Please document the ctor and all public methods.

File Comment: engines/ep/tests/module_tests/task_concurrency_test.cc -> copyright header.
Line:3, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/task_concurrency_test.cc -> Technically this should be #include "" as it's a file within our own project (ep-engine).

Line:1, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/task_concurrency_test.h -> Missing copyright.

Line:16, engines/ep/src/semaphore_bounded_task.cc -> CompactTask sets sleeptime to 0, and that's the GlobalTask default too.  Will set it to 0 for LimitedConcurrencyTask for least surprise
