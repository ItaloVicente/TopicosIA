DESCRIPTION:

MB-55467: Compaction passes HistoryMode to magma at WriteDocs()

The MagmaKVStore::compactDBInternal() might make a call into
magma::WriteDocs() by omitting the HistoryMode arg. By default the API
sets HisotryMode::Disabled, which has the effect of discarding the
history for the vbucket under compaction.

Fix that by passing the proper HistoryMode to the call.

Note: In the following we'll remove the default value for the
HistoryMode arg from the API for preventing any similar issue. Deferred
to a dedicated change.
