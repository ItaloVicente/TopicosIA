DESCRIPTION:

MB-50984: Remove num-item-based checkpoint creation

Since Neo we have an implicit upper bound on the max number of
checkpoints (per bucket) that is logically given by (CMQuota /
CheckpointMaxSize).

Still, there are code paths that interfere with that and possibly break
that invariant. One of those is chk_max_items, which triggers checkpoint
creation when the user-defined max num of items has been queued into a
single checkpoint. Here we remove that trigger.
