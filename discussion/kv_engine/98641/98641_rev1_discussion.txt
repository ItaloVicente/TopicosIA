DESCRIPTION:

Convert engines to MODULE libraries

The various engines are loaded as plugins via (cb)dlopen. In CMake
parlance this makes them 'module' libraries not 'shared' libraries.

Change them over to module - this shouldn't have any user-visible
effect; but allows CMake to chekc they are used correctly - for
example ensuring you don't try to depend on a module library.
