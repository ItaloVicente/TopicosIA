DESCRIPTION:

MB-30552: Replace VBucket(Map)::id_type with Vbid type

Seeming as VBucket::id_type was changed from uint16_t to Vbid,
the use of VBucket::id_type can be clarified throughout the
codebase by changing to the shorter, consistent type 'Vbid'.
Following suit, VBucketMap::id_type has been done in the same
patch to avoid potential confusion.

Change-Id: I2d41f75fd9e6684fb425b1fe7d17ae0e6a64e2e3
