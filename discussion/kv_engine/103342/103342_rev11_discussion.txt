DESCRIPTION:

MB-32593: Introduce Memory Tracking Allocator

We intend to move the CheckpointQueue from a stl::list to a std::deque
and want to be able to track any changes in memory overhead.

This patch introduces a memory allocator that allows memory usage to be
tracked.  This is used by the CheckpointQueue to allow accurate
measurement of memory usage.
