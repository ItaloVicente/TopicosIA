DESCRIPTION:

MB-28850: Fix regression in append stat tracking

- Append operations are supposed to be tracked under cmd_set.
- A refactoring of the append state machine caused this stat to
  not be incremented after successful appends.
- This commit ensures that the stat is appending at the correct
  stage of the append operation state machine.
- Added unit tests to ensure that any future regression in append
  stat tracking is caught.
