DESCRIPTION:

Document the state transition diagram for MCBP connections

And added some minor tweaks to the state diagram by checking
for the entire packet header being available before moving
into the conn_read_packet_body

-1 for the ptr / reference change; otherwise looks good.
Line:1767, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> If you're removing this, probably safer / cleaner to make it take a reference.

Line:86, daemon/statemachine_mcbp.h -> Just occurred to me - I wonder if we should re-benchmark different values of `n` - particulary for normal client connections. I'm particulary wondering if we should reduce it which would in theory reduce the client latency (as possibly some loss in throughput).

What do you think? Given that most users don't run us anywhere near max throughput, maybe we should optimise for latency out-of-the-box.

Line:93, daemon/statemachine_mcbp.h -> Would be awesome if you could turn all this into a graphical state transition diagram - maybe using Dot + Doxygen? https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/commands.html#cmddot

Line:1767, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> That require bigger changes... (We could leave the assert in there, but it is currently impossible to get there with it being nullptr as it's only being called from the state machine..

The motivation for changing the signature is that I simplified the state transition diagram by not entering this method unless we've got the entire header in place.. Earlier it also supported the ascii protocol, which means that in theory it could be true for 5 characters (get a\n)

Line:86, daemon/statemachine_mcbp.h -> To be honest I think we could probably drop the entire backoff ;) In memcached all items was in memory, so you'd have a 100% resident ratio for all commands so you could basically run "forever" if the receiving socket and sending socket drained "fast enough" so that you never hit a EWOULDBLOCK case

With our buckets I'd be surprised if we don't ever hit a ewouldblock case ;)

Line:93, daemon/statemachine_mcbp.h -> Yes, but I'll leave that for now. I'd like to refactor our code to only use the "normal" states, and get rid of all of the special states (conn_audit_configure with friends)

We could also clean up the state diagram a bit more to make it even more deterministic of what the next state would be...

Line:1767, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> I think this function is only called from two places - so should be easy to change to a reference?

Line:1767, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> Sure, but also the entire implementation ;)

Line:1767, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> If you really don't want to change all the `c->` to `c.` you can simply create a ptr at the head of the function:

 void try_read_mcbp_command(McbpConnection& conn) {
 auto* c = &conn;
 ...

Line:1767, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> (it's more that I don't see the big win of changing this single entry as part of a commit trying to document the state machinery. All of the other function in the same file operate on a pointer, the rest of the state machinery operate on a pointer... The only reason I changed the function signature was to make the state transition diagram easier (so that we don't have the extra state transitions going back again to the conn_waiting state)....

We could go ahead and move everything over to a reference, but I think it would be better (and more consistent) to do it in a single pass

Line:1767, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> Then restore the nullptr check in the head of the function and I'm happy ;)

My issue is simply that you've made the code (statically) less safe as there's no check that the input param isn't null.

Line:1767, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> I'll do that.. to be honest this certainly feels like a waste of time and effort as we're going to continue to refactor this code (and such checks can be added later on). Have you _ever_ seen that exception being thrown in all of the billions of times the method have been called? I've certainly not (and from the call contexts it is impossible as well)
