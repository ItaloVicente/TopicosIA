DESCRIPTION:

MB-31450: Track max-deleted revision using checkpoint::queueDirty

When a checkpoint encounters a DEL(k1) then SET(k1) it will
discard the DEL(k1) (de-duplication). A consequence of this
is that the flusher will not be able to update the vbucket
meta-data (vbstate) with the correct "max-deleted revision seqno".

As shown in the test this could mean that conflict resolution could
allow a mutation if a warmup occurred.

To address this issue, the flusher no longer inspects flushed items
looking for deletes, the checkpoint now does the inspection before
de-duplication occurs and records the revision of each delete
encountered. This values is then past through to the flusher
when it retrieves the items to flush.

When a muta de-duplicates a delete we lose track
