DESCRIPTION:

MB-42122: Move local doc parsing code to kv_engine

In a future change I will remove the couchstore specifics from the
local doc parsing code (this commit is just a move) so that the local
doc parsing code can then be reused in magma_dump

Change-Id: I5645130722062e9d7b4ab2197d2c137a9e82e4fc
