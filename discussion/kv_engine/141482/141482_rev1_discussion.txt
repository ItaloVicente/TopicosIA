DESCRIPTION:

MB-41165: Rename collections persistedHighSeqno to persistedVisibleSeqno

To be able to add the size of prepares to the disk size of the
collection we must modify the stats tracking code to allow us to
add stats when we have a collection with only prepares in it.
Currently we have many highSeqno/persistedHighSeqno checks that we
cannot pass so no stat doc gets written. To fix these we need to track
a high seqno that includes prepares. To follow the same naming
convention as vBucket level stats, rename persistedHighSeqno to
persistedVisibleSeqno. In a future patch I'll add back
persistedHighSeqno where necessary and include prepares in it.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> this name losses on property of the fact it's the MaxVisableSeqno on disk. It's probably not a big issue but think changing it to reflect that its a MaxVisableSeqno/HighVisableSeqno removes any ambiguity that it could be any VisableSeqno thats persisted.

Line:273, engines/ep/src/collections/flush.h -> ditto

Line:309, engines/ep/src/collections/flush.h -> update comment

Line:85, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.cc -> does this need a TODO for when you add back highSeqno? Or should we just change the state key.
