DESCRIPTION:

MB-34217: Add support for dropping collections with prepares

Add support for dropping collections with prepares. When we remove a
prepare we need to cleanup the ADM and PDM. We need to remove the
prepares without updating the HCS or HPS. All iterators have to be
moved back to their previous position (if valid).

A test will fail but this test catches the race between compactions on active vs replica that I still need to fix

Thinking that to solve the active vs replica racing issue we need to remove the prepares from the DM at collection drop instead of at collection erasure. It probably makes more sense to do this for both active and replica than just the replica too. I don't think anything will fail as we always ack (persistence or replica) a seqno instead of a key
