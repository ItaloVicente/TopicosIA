DESCRIPTION:

MB-34217: Add support for dropping collections with prepares

Add support for dropping collections with prepares. When we remove a
prepare we need to cleanup the ADM and PDM. We need to remove the
prepares without updating the HCS or HPS. All iterators have to be
moved back to their previous position (if valid).

Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

Have not fixed the racing active vs replica issue yet. Still want to only call into the DM if the prepare is not complete, but this requires wiring a few things through callbacks and is more of an optimization so will probably do that in a different patch
