DESCRIPTION:

MB-34217: Add support for dropping collections with prepares

Add support for dropping collections with prepares. When we remove a
prepare we need to cleanup the ADM and PDM. We need to remove the
prepares without updating the HCS or HPS. All iterators have to be
moved back to their previous position (if valid).

some comments/questions
Line:810, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Will magma-kvstore have to do the same check? Might be worth adding an extra arg to the dropKeyCb and allowing that function to do nothing for aborts

Line:875, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> update comment? map of collection and mention what does it map to (seqno, prepared?)

Line:534, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> remove

Line:981, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> an alternative could be to have the trigger once we've persisted the drop ( Collections::VB::Flush::checkAndTriggerPurge)? I don't know if that makes any difference, better 'consistency' etc... or does having this here provide functionality, stopping the replica acking for collections that are dropped?

Line:981, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> I vaguely recall from chatting with Ben that this might be to avoid the PDM seeing seemingly out of order completions:

Active drops a collection mid-sync write
Active discards prepare A and removes from ADM
Active completes next prepare B
Replica sees
 Prepare A
 Prepare B
 Drop Collection (containing A)
 Commit B

If this notification were delayed until persistence, the replica could receive the Commit B before being notified the other collection was dropped - it would still be expecting A to be completed first.

Caveat - this may be misremembered or entirely wrong, I just wanted to mention it as it came to mind :shrug: Ben will have the whole answer 😊

Line:981, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> The bySeqnoScanCallback actually solves this for us by not warming up anything in a dropped collection. I've added a test to cover it anyway

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:981, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> James is correct, we may get a snapshot containing a collection drop then a commit for a different alive collection and process both before persistence.

The replica can still ack but the active would skip the item if the ack would drive a commit. Given collections drops should be relatively infrequent I don't a potentially pointless ack matters.

One issue with this (as a whole, not notifying the PDM here) though is I think we can warmup and load prepares of dropped collections into the DMs.
