DESCRIPTION:

MB-46890: Refactor: add factory method for AuditEventFilter

And hide the class details into the .cc file so that we don't
have to expose all of the internal guts when we want to add
support for bucket, scope and collection filters

Change-Id: I77837cd7fa13ddfb416a9fd649e1da701a754805
