DESCRIPTION:

MB-28941: Make tracing of SET_WITH_META cheaper by reusing histogram times

For SET_WITH_META operations, instead of using the TRACE_SCOPE macro
(and generating it's own begin/end time), make use of the existing
timestamps which are used for setWithMetaHisto. This has brings two
benefits:

1. The timestamps in session tracing and the histograms are
   consistent.

2. We save 2x calls to ProcessClock::now for SET_WITH_META ops.

To achieve this, we need the ability to record session tracing begin
and end events independantly, as the timing for SET_WITH_META isn't
limited to a single block (due to EWOULDBLOCK handling). As such,
introduce two new macros for this purpose:

* TRACE_BEGIN(cookie, code [,timestamp]) - Begins a trace span for the
  given cookie and tracecode.

* TRACE_END(cookie, code [,timestamp]) - End a trace span for the
  given cookie and tracecode.

In both instances, the caller can optionally specify the timestamp to
record; if not specified the current time is used.
