DESCRIPTION:

MB-19889: Test BackfillManager::scanBuffer limit on readyQ for Producer

The Stream::readyQ is std::queue. So, there is no built-in limit on the
size.
In the case of a backfill, an indirect limit is enforced by the
BackfillManager::scanBuffer constraints.
I add some tests to check that those constraints are correclty applied.

Line:3338, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> No! The whole point is you /don't/ include a default case; then if one ever adds another enumeration value the compiler will warn the enum isn't covered :)

See http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-switch-if

Line:162, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.h -> Personally I would have gone the other way and passed by (non-const) value - it's a value type of size int; so passing by reference (8 bytes) is actually more costly; and given it's by value you can't change it anyway.

Line:3338, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> This is a case of auto-completion working even too well in Eclipse :)

Line:162, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.h -> The reason is to avoid that someone changes accidentally 'limitType' from inside the function. That could result in missing to test some scenario. 
But it's ok, I'll pass by value and add 'const' in the function definition.
