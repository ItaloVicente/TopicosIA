DESCRIPTION:

MB-19889: Test BackfillManager::scanBuffer limit on readyQ for Producer

The Stream::readyQ is std::queue. So, there is no built-in limit on the
size.
In the case of a backfill, an indirect limit is enforced by the
BackfillManager::scanBuffer constraints.
I add some tests to check that those constraints are correclty applied.
