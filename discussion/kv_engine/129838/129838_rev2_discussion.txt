DESCRIPTION:

MB-34217: Remove 'Expects' committed from dropKey

The collection dropKey path can receive committed and pending
keys which triggers the expects, short-cutting compaction.

It is safe to continue the dropKey code for pending or committed
items and is preferable than having compaction stop.

Note that couch-kvstore adjusts the purge counting so that we
don't try and underflow the vbucket item count. If an item
is prepared it should not be counted towards purged collections,
otherwise we try and subtract prepared items from the total
item count, and the total item count does not include prepares.

This commit does not resolve the MB, pending items are still left
in the hash table and the ADM/PDM still track the pending writes.

I think we should hold off on merging this for now. If we just leave prepares in the DM then we'll just end up with exceptions firing later down the line when we attempt to abort the prepares (as nothing is in the HashTable).

Adding -1 to track the fact this probably isn't ready yet.
