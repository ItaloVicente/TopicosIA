DESCRIPTION:

MB-34217: Add prepare param to EphemeralVB::isKeyLogicallyDeleted

In EphemeralVBucket::isKeyLogicallyDelete() we call dropKey() to drop
a key that has been deleted due to a collection drop. We need to be
able to drop prepares from the DM's here in a future patch and so we
need to know whether or not we are working with a prepare.
