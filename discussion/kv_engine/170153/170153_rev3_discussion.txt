DESCRIPTION:

MB-49512: Move logging and common executor code to GlobalTask::execute

Currently we don't log the bucket if a thread schedule or run is slow
which can sometimes be useful information. We don't have this
information because we don't set the thread local via a
BucketAllocationGuard before calling these functions. Correct this by
moving the code into the GlobalTask::execute function (as the code
is common for both ExecutorPool implementations) and under the
BucketAllocationGuard that we already take to execute the task (so that
we don't ping-pong between contexts/memory arenas).

I had originally fixed the logRunTime call in the same way as it suffers from the same issue but I've now moved all the log functions into the GlobalTask::execute to combine the thread switches
