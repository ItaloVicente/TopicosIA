DESCRIPTION:

MB-40467: Don't use updateStoredValue in VBucket::handlePreExpiry

At "expiration by access" currently we replace the SV's value by calling
HT::unlocked_updateStoredValue and then we execute the soft-delete
logic.

The problem with updateStoredValue is that the function updates the
deleted-state of the StoredValue. While that is fine for the usual
write-path, in the case of expiration we esentially loose the "pre
expiration deleted-state", which leads to errors in the accounting of
BasicLinkedList::numDeletedItems for Ephemeral. See the code in
BasicLinkedList::updateNumDeletedItems for details.

The problem is currently hidden by the main issue caught in MB-40467,
and an ep_testsuite test fails as soon as we fix MB-40467.
So, this patch is pre-requirememnt for the actual main fix for MB-40467.
The follow-up patch contains the fix for MB-40467 and the test coverage
for it. Plus, the existing ep_testsuite covers what we fix in this
patch.

Can you please add a new test to hash_table_test which explicitly tests which new method.
Line:999, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Using std::string for value is non-standard - elsewhere we use Blob directly or Item (which contains a Blob).

Suggest you stick to Blob here.

Line:827, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Not sure how useful this comment is for the future reader - they are unlikely to care about the name of the incorect method we used when a pevious bug was fixed.

If you want to keep a comment here I'd say something like "replace value and datatype, keeping other properties (e.g. deletedState) the same"

Doing
Line:999, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Done

Line:827, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Yeah, I actually think that here we are fine without comment as what you suggest is already in the doc for the new function. Removing
