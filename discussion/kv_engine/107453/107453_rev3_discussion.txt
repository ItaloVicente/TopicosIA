DESCRIPTION:

MB-33699: Detect if we try to connect to port -1

From looking at the test failure it seems like we've got
an occurrence of port being set to -1.

Change the code to:

  1. Detect that the portnumber file don't contain an entry
     with the port being set to -1

  2. Whenever we try to connect that the port is set to
     something else than -1.
