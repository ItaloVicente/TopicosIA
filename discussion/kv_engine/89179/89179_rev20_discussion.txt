DESCRIPTION:

MB-27661 [1/n]: Fix MSCV warnings

Introduces 2 new gsl concepts, narrow<>() and narrow_cast<>().
narrow_cast is used to silently force type a->b, whereas
narrow checks that no data will be lost and throws an error
if this is the case.

Change-Id: I4691aad46dc783a2082e2d370cfa5d12533761b1
