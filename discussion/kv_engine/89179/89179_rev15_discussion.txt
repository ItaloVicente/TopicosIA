DESCRIPTION:

MB-27661 [1/n]: Fix MSCV warnings

Introduces 2 new gsl concepts, narrow<>() and narrow_cast<>().
narrow_cast is used to silently force type a->b, whereas
narrow checks that no data will be lost and throws an error
if this is the case.

Line:104, daemon/mc_time.cc -> int64_t - or change the numeric_limits<T> to rel_time_t

Line:125, daemon/mc_time.cc -> Should probably hoist this to the previous clause (line 122).

Line:428, daemon/memcached.cc -> Not quite sure why we need this cast; given `ret` is size_t and the return type is also size_t. I guess the `double` is getting in the way? 

Maybe just replace the float division by int (`/ 4 * 3`) ?

Line:434, daemon/memcached.cc -> Maybe look at using std::stoll (long long) which might avoid the cast.

Line:59, daemon/protocol/mcbp/get_meta_context.cc -> u_long isn't a standard (portable) type we use.

Line:724, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> You don't need the const.

Line:753, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> ditto (and elsewhere in this file).

Line:166, daemon/timing_histogram.cc -> another const!

Line:224, daemon/timing_histogram.cc -> Given the underlying type is uint64_t; probably simpler to make this method return the same type.
