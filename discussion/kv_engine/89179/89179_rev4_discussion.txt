Line:309, daemon/connection.cc -> Better to keep the catch by const& (avoids the need to copy the exception); but simply make it anonymous (remove the name) to avoid warnings about not using `error`

Line:528, daemon/connection.cc -> ditto

Line:73, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> This will only work on macOS (darwin is the codename of the underlying open source kernel). This probably wants to be `time_t`.

Line:123, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Shouldn't need the const here.

Line:124, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> You should be fine just casting getConnectionIdleTime() - best to minimise scope where possible.

Line:337, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> This looks wrong - note that SOCKET is a different type on windows (in our code we typedef an int only when not on Windows - see platform/socket.h).

I don't believe you should need any cast here.

Line:693, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Note - you shouldn't need the const here; you're passing a primitive by value so const is pretty meaningless.

Line:716, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> In this case it's probably cleaner to change the type of `msgbytes` to size_t - avoids the need to perform a narrowing cast.

Line:907, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Suggest using `double` like all the other instances (I don't believe there's anything special about this one).
