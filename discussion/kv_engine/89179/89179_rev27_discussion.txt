DESCRIPTION:

MB-27661 [1/n]: Fix MSCV warnings

Introduces 2 new gsl concepts, narrow<>() and narrow_cast<>().
narrow_cast is used to silently force type a->b, whereas
narrow checks that no data will be lost and throws an error
if this is the case.

This also introduces a new constant, MASKED_CAS (types.h) which
represents the value we return when an item is under lock.

LGTM. @Trond could you take a look over this given it touches a lot of daemon/ ?

I feel the patch is touching too much in too many places (and doing unrelated stuff: removing unused variable names in exceptions, adding the gsl::casts, formatting json by using strings instead of numbers (it would probably be better to just override the cJSON methods to add automatically detect if the number is too big?))

Would it be possible to split the patch into multiple patches doing a single thing?

I guess we should also consider if we could change the datatypes we're using to avoid a number of all of the "narrow" things..
Line:203, daemon/alloc_hooks_jemalloc.cc -> This should probably be fixed to check for the proper return value:

According to https://linux.die.net/man/3/jemalloc 

"The mallctl, mallctlnametomib, and mallctlbymib functions return 0 on success; otherwise they return an error value. "

Line:919, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Why are we adding numbers as strings here? The only values which could be too big would be the total sent/received.

Line:200, daemon/settings.cc -> We should be able to add test case for this?

Line:919, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Agreed - but I'd argue inaccurate stats could potentially be misleading. It was my suggestion to use string for them all; as that way we are guaranteed to have the a non-rounded value in each case.

Ultimately this is an issue with cJSON's number representation. I don't know if Modern JSON for C++ is any better?

Line:919, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> I haven't tested the other json library we've got as we had to upgrade msvc in order to get it working... 

That being said, we should be able to fix this in cJSON rather than having to deal with that everywhere we use the library. Right now cJSON_AddNumberToObject is a macro, but we could easily move that over to an overloaded function (and make it work all over our code)
