DESCRIPTION:

MB-27661 [1/n]: Fix MSCV warnings

Introduces 2 new gsl concepts, narrow<>() and narrow_cast<>().
narrow_cast is used to silently force type a->b, whereas
narrow checks that no data will be lost and throws an error
if this is the case.

This also introduces a new constant, MASKED_CAS (types.h) which
represents the value we return when an item is under lock.

@Trond should probably also take a look at the mcbp changes.
Line:123, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> const unncessary.

Line:918, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> In hindsight I think it's probably better to change all these to JSON strings; then we have no issue with loosing precision for large values.

Line:428, daemon/memcached.cc -> Can you check this? I think you'll end up with ret / (4 * 3) according to operator precidence.

Either way it's generally best to include brackets to avoid any ambiguity.

Line:547, daemon/memcached.cc -> Similar to other places; prefer to change the type of setNumWorkerThreads to size_t.

Line:90, daemon/protocol/mcbp/get_locked_context.cc -> not needed.

Line:280, daemon/subdocument.cc -> Not needed.

Line:282, daemon/subdocument.cc -> same
