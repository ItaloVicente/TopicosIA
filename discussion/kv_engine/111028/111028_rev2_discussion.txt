DESCRIPTION:

MB-34628: WIP Fix for data race during commit

Note that unit test doesn't fail in same way as reported bug yet - it fails with:

[ RUN      ] AllBucketTypes/ActiveDurabilityMonitorTest.SeqnoAckReceivedConcurrentDataRace/ephemeral_auto_delete
libc++abi.dylib: terminating with uncaught exception of type std::logic_error: Monotonic<x> invariant failed: new value (1) breaks invariant on current value (2)

TSan issue - lock-order inversion involving Collections manifest and new completedSWQueue...:

[ RUN      ] AllBucketTypes/ActiveDurabilityMonitorTest.SeqnoAckReceivedSmallerThanLastAcked/ephemeral_auto_delete
