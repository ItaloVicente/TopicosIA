DESCRIPTION:

MB-34628 [2/2] SR: Avoid race during SyncWrite completion

Problem
-------

If a bucket accepting SyncWrites has >1 replica configured then it is
possible for SyncWrites to be incorrectly committed out-of-order (with
respect to their seqnos). The consequence is that DCP_COMMIT messages
will be rejected by the replicas:

    PassiveDurabilityMonitor::completeSyncWrite: Pending resolution for 'SW ...' but received unexpected commit for ...

If two (or more) replicas send a SEQNO_ACK to the active node, and the
DCP connections for those replicas are associated with at least 2
different front-end threads, then it is possible for
ActiveDurabilityMonitor::seqnoAckReceived() to be called by two
different threads at the same time.

If the acknowledged seqnos result in at least one prepared SyncWrite
to be committed for each connection, then while SyncWrites are removed
from the DurabilityMonitor in the correct order, they can be committed
(via VBucket::commit()) out of order.

For example, consider the following scenario:

    Active:   1:PRE(a) 2:PRE(b)
    Replica1:                    SEQNO_ACK(1)
    Replica2:                    SEQNO_ACK(2)

    time ----------------------------------------->

The two SEQNO_ACKs are processed concurrently, calling
ActiveDurabilityMonitor::seqnoAckReceived() (comments removed for
brevity):

    ENGINE_ERROR_CODE ActiveDurabilityMonitor::seqnoAckReceived(
            const std::string& replica, int64_t preparedSeqno) {
        Container toCommit;
        state.wlock()->processSeqnoAck(replica, preparedSeqno, toCommit);

        // Commit the verified SyncWrites
        for (const auto& sw : toCommit) {
            commit(sw);
        }

        return ENGINE_SUCCESS;
    }

The actual processing of Seqno Acks is serialised via state.wlock() so
there's no problem there, however consider if each thread ended up
with 1 item in their local toCommit variable - COMMIT(a) and
COMMIT(b). There is no serialisation on the calls to commit(), so (b)
could be committed before (a). This breaks the in-order commit
requirements.

(Note the above only mentions Commit of SyncWrites, however exactly
the same problem exist for Abort.)

Solution
--------

At a high level we need to ensure the SyncWrites are completed
in-order. The simplest approach would be to keep the ActiveDM::state
locked while calling commit(), however this would introduce a
potential deadlock (lock-order inversion between the Collections
Manifest lock and the ActiveDM::State lock as they would be acquired
in different orders in two different situations:

Case 1: KVBucket::set():

    * KVBucket:set (also add, replace...):
      LOCK VB::Manifest
          * VBucket::set()
              * VBucket::checkDurabilityRequirements()
                LOCK ActiveDM::State
                ...

Case 2: ActiveDurabilityMonitor::seqnoAckReceived():

    * ActiveDurabilityMonitor::seqnoAckReceived()
      LOCK ActiveDM::State
          * ActiveDurabilityMonitor::commit
            LOCK VB::Manifest

As such, a slightly more complex solutio is needed. This is to
introduce a separate 'completedQueue' member of ActiveDM which holds
in FIFO order all completed SyncWrites, and from which VB::commit /
VB::abort() will dequeue items.

This avoids the above deadlock by changing case 2 to unlock the
ActiveDM::State lock before we call ActiveDM::commit():

    * ActiveDurabilityMonitor::seqnoAckReceived()
      LOCK ActiveDM::State
      ... transfer completed SyncWrites to completedQueue
      UNLOCK ActiveDM::State
          * ActiveDurabilityMonitor::commit
            LOCK VB::Manifest

Implementation
--------------

Use folly's Unbounded, single producer/single consuemr queue for the
completedQueue. (Single producer and single consumer are required to
ensure SyncWrites are both enqueued and dequeued in the original
commit order).

To ensure a single producer, require that enqueue()ing a completed
SyncWrite has a non-const reference to the ActiveDM::state, which in
turn requires that has been write (exclusively) locked.

To ensure a single consumer, add a ConsumerLock to the completedQueue
which must be locked (and passed into try_dequeue()).
