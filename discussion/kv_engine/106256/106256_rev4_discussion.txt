Line:142, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> Note this isn't equivalent - stat (as used inside isFile) doesn't check if the file is accessible by the current user.

Line:142, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> It would then fail if we tried to remove the file (as it was owned from a different user). The file should have been created by the system so the user _should_ be the same.

Line:142, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> In this particular case that's true; remove would fail in the same way. 

But I'm not sure it's universally true in all places we use access(). We /could/ change isFile() to also check that the caller has read access, then it would be equivalent.

Line:142, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> We could do that, but I'm not sure if it's really worth it ;-) someone would have to explicitly go in and mock with the files in the system for this to fail.. and do we expect the sw to work if someone does random things to the files in our system?

Personally I'd rather we just waited ~a few days and relies on Folly's existing portability abstractions - it already has access() implemented for Windows.
Line:1109, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> In this instance it could cause problems, as we are no longer checking we can actually read the file.

I agree things will fail ether way (before or after your patch) if the file isn't accessible by `couchbase`, but the change requires analysis of how the control-flow is affected.

Line:142, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> According to the man page:

    The mode specifies the accessibility check(s)
    to be performed, and is either the value F_OK,
    or a mask consisting of the bitwise OR of one
    or more of R_OK, W_OK, and X_OK.  F_OK tests
    for the existence of the file.  R_OK, W_OK,
    and X_OK test whether the file exists and grants
    read, write, and execute permissions, respectively.

F_OK checks for existence of the file, and you'd need R_OK to check for read access

Line:1109, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> As with the other comment, F_OK checks for existence. R_OK needs to be used to check for readability

Line:142, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> Ah - apologies - I misread and thought it was asking for R_OK.

So fine, I think this is _functionally_ fine, but I still say we should put effort into _removng_ our own platform abstraction stuff (i.e. std::io::isFile) and just migrating to folly's :)

Given you've done this and it's passing CV we might as well merge it, but I think we should focus on moving over to folly's portability instead of adding any of our own in future patches.

Line:142, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> That require folly to be available ;) It is also easier from a transition perspective to start by using folly's inside cb:io and they can live side by side until we've replaced all of them...
