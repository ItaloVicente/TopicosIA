DESCRIPTION:

Restructure mock_server notify_io_complete to match real server

When adding a new ep_testsuite-level test to verify SyncWrite timeout
behaviour, TSan reported a lock-order inversion between the Cookie
mutex and the Collection Manifest mutex.

For front-end operations the Cookie mutex is always acquired before
the Manifest mutex. However during the test the
DurabilityCompletionTask calls notify_io_complete on the CookieIface
with the Manifest mutex held. The implementation of notify_io_complete
for MockCookie acquires the Cookie mutex and hence there is a
lock-order inversion.

This _is_ a test-only issue - the "real" memcached Cookie/Connection
doesn't acqire the Cookie mutex as part of notify_io_complete and
hence there is no lock-order issue in production, however it causes
the test to fail under TSan. It also highlights the fact that the test
harness is not representative of the real system.

To address both these issues, modify mock_server / mock_cookie to
handle locking in the same way as the real server:

1. Instead of notify_io_complete acquiring the Cookie's mutex and
   updating the async status immediately, add the status to be
   notified to a per-cookie queue - not yet modifying the Cookie (and
   hence no Cookie mutex acquired).

2. When waiting for a notification, instead of checking the per-cookie
   notification count, instead wait on the new cookie notification
   queue to be non-empty; when it is pop off the head of the queue and
   update the cookie's status then (taking the Cookie mutex).

This matches the locking behaviur of the real server - only the
front-end thread which "owns" a given Cookie/Connection acquires the
Cookie mutex during async notification handling.
