DESCRIPTION:

MB-35150 Ensue GetReplica returns previous stored value

Ensue GetReplica returns previous stored value instead of
ENGINE_SYNC_WRITE_RECOMMIT_IN_PROGRESS when a new item is pending for
the key specified by the GetReplica op.

To ensure we do this, VBucket::getInternal() must be informed it is
called for a GetReplica. If so we want to make sure we only look for
committed values in the has table using findOnlyCommitted() otherwise
we need to use fetchValidValue(). The same modification has also been
made to EPVBucket::completeBGFetchForSingleItem() so that when we are
performing a bgfetch for an item requested by a GET_REPLICA op we
correctly fetch only committed values from disk.

Also refactor KVBucketIface::getInternal() interface and
implementations so that they take a bool to inform the method if the
get is for a replica vbucket or not. As apposed to the allowedState
parameter which is only ever in the vbucket_state_active or
vbucket_state_replica state.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> maybe "committed value" to disambiguate

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ensure

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> hash

Line:107, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Is it okay to not check cHandle.valid() before doing this? (just from comparison to the other branch, haven't read around)

Line:109, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> fetchValidValue checks some things that are probably important - e.g., result.pendingSV->isPreparedMaybeVisible(). Does the new code path do that too?

Line:277, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> there is precedent for parameters like this being an enum even if there are only two possiblities, "true" needs documenting and with default args if a new arg was added old call sites could now be passing true to a different parameter etc. I'd check what others think but Yes No enum do appear elsewhere IIRC.

See ep_types.h

Line:303, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> It might even be worth making this more explicit - currently someone reading the definition doesn't know what will be done differently if they pass true vs false. For example (not necessarily an accurate replacement, but just for the concept) if this were "committedItemsOnly" or something, it's clear from the definition and from the usages what is desired at a particular point. Also if we end up needing to use this flag in cases other than GetReplica it would save renaming to "bgForGetReplicaOrFooOrBar"

Line:178, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_rollback_test.cc -> By moving to a bool we seem to have lost the possibility for vbucket_state_pending, which is the other state used in this test from what I can see (rollback will presumably not be tested against active?)

Line:1288, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> Doesn't feel like this is so different from KVBucketTest that it needs a new test fixture and we could hit more cases (ephemeral/full eviction) if you re-used existing ones (e.g. DurabilityBucketTest for the durability related tests). Also, we have tried to keep all durability tests in Durability specific test fixures so that would be preferrable

Line:1290, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> Replica

Line:1348, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> these should probably be in the test where you do the thing, it's a bit hard to marry up the description here to the action in the test

Line:109, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> We specifically only want values that are committed and thus will not be pending or in the state of "PreparedMaybeVisible". As we want to return the last commited value this replica received for the given key.
