DESCRIPTION:

MB-35150 Ensure GetReplica returns only committed values

Ensure GetReplica returns committed values instead of
ENGINE_SYNC_WRITE_RECOMMIT_IN_PROGRESS when a new item is pending for
the key specified by the GetReplica op.

To ensure we do this, VBucket::getInternal() must be informed it is
called for a GetReplica. If so we want to make sure we only look for
committed values in the hash table using findOnlyCommitted() otherwise
we need to use fetchValidValue(). The same modification has also been
made to EPVBucket::completeBGFetchForSingleItem() so that when we are
performing a bgfetch for an item requested by a GET_REPLICA op we
correctly fetch only committed values from disk.

Also refactor KVBucketIface::getInternal() interface and
implementations so that they take a bool to inform the method if the
get is for a replica vbucket or not. As apposed to the allowedState
parameter which is only ever in the vbucket_state_active or
vbucket_state_replica state.

Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> this needs updating

Line:149, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> empty comment

Line:285, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> BGFetch should never return a non-committed item (in current master) so I don't think this change is necessary. Could make the completion unconditonally get the committed item.

Line:1466, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> I realise this is a translation of the logic that was here before, but it has lost a little meaning over the patchsets - someone reading this needs to understand why only committed means disallow active.

The disallowed state is used to trigger a notmyvbucket response, which made sense when the allowed state was passed in. Now it doesn't correlate as well with `statesToFind`. Kinda violates "least surprise", a user of the method has to know the details of the implementation to know why they are getting a notmyvbucket, when all they wanted was to just get commits :shrug:

Line:1510, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> haven't followed it all the way through, but potential solution for my above comment - could the statesToFind being passed down to the vb be worked out /here/ from allowedState, and keep allowedState as it was? Then the NMVB response logic still makes sense, and the vb->getInternal call gets a meaningful WantedItemState

Line:806, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket_iface.h -> Not strictly true any more - it says what item states are acceptable to return, it just happens that that currently directly correlates with get replica ops

Line:1229, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> ditto

Line:2205, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> does this want a description?

Line:2215, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Ooooo, check the docs but IIRC it is not advised to have default args on virtual methods. Again, IIRC the default args are not dynamically determined - calling 

 struct A {
     virtual void do(int x = 4) {...}
 };
 struct B {
     virtual void do(int x = 12) {...}
 };

A* a = new B();

A->do();

will call B::do(4);

/I think/

Line:2215, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> yeah that snippet is entirely wrong but you get the idea,

B should inherit from A, the second virtual doesn't want to be there etc etc etc

 will call B::do(4);

That is a bit better. Forgive the spam :badpokerface:

Line:2626, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I think Ben noted something related to this too, but I thought prepares were always resident?

Line:267, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> EXPECT isn't a fatal failure so if the get does fail this will still dereference a (I guess) potentially null ptr. (not the end of the world or anything as the test has already logically failed at that point, just thought I'd mention it)

Line:313, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> default

Line:314, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> could/should this be const static? :shrug:

Line:2503, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> This sets the item as pending may be visible while the vb is active - probably fine (as the goal is to check getReplica) but doesn't seem reflective of normal behaviour.

Alternatively, setPendingItem could store the item through KVBucket::prepare or VBucket::prepare, with the vb in state_replica.

Line:2511, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> could pull this out into a variable like pendingValue

Line:2532, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> could this be from the variable?

Line:2553, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> possibly better to use DurabilityEPBucketTest

Line:2611, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> Sync?

Line:2650, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> *narrows eyes* I personally vote for British spellings, but I'm not sure that is actually in the code guidelines.
