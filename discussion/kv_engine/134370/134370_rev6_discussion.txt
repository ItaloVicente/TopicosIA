DESCRIPTION:

Build speed [4/6]: Reduce inclusion of vbucket.h

Using ClangBuildAnalyzer highlighted that the header 'vbucket.h' is
the most expensive header to include when building
ep-engine_ep_unit_tests.

Overall time to build ep-engine_ep_unit_tests and top 5 expensive
headers:

Before:

      157.96 real      1397.12 user        81.91 sys

    119699 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/vbucket.h (included 101 times, avg 1185 ms)
    88528 ms: tlm/deps/json.exploded/include/nlohmann/json.hpp (included 137 times, avg 646 ms)
    75024 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h (included 67 times, avg 1119 ms)
    61643 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h (included 46 times, avg 1340 ms)
    61404 ms: ../kv_engine/include/memcached/dockey.h (included 209 times, avg 293 ms)

vbucket.h is both included in a large number of places, and has a high
include cost. Reduce the number of places it is included, by:

- Forward-declaring where possible.
- Moving VBNotifyCtx from vbucket.h to it's own header.

This reduces the cost of vbucket.h from 119s to 74s:

After:
      149.26 real      1422.24 user        81.96 sys

    83770 ms: tlm/deps/json.exploded/include/nlohmann/json.hpp (included 135 times, avg 620 ms)
    74002 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/vbucket.h (included 99 times, avg 747 ms)
    70453 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h (included 67 times, avg 1051 ms)
    59612 ms: ../kv_engine/include/memcached/engine.h (included 150 times, avg 397 ms)
    59038 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h (included 46 times, avg 1283 ms)
