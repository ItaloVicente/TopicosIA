DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Remove stale SyncWrites from the tracked container

A SyncWrite is stale if it has been acknowledged by all nodes in the
Replication Chain. Note that by logic a stale SyncWrite has been also
committed.

Note that in the current implementation both the replicas and commit
state is embedded in the SyncWrite pointed by each replica/commit
iterator. So, given that by logic we remove only unreferenced
SyncWrites, then the tracked container can be empty only before the
first SyncWrite is added for tracking. I.e., stale-removal can remove up
to (container_size - 1) elements.

Note this approach feels somewhat complex. I think it would be simpler (and I don't think we loose much) if you simply remove stale SyncWrites immediately after committing them.

In terms of handling the iterators; you could simply make any iterator pointing to the item you want to remove instead point to the previous element; if that element doesn't exist then you could simplify by always having a sentinel element at the start of the list which is effectively seqno zero.
