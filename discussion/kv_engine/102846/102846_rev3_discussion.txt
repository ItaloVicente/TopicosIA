DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Remove stale SyncWrites from the tracked container

A SyncWrite is stale if it has been acknowledged by all nodes in the
Replication Chain. Note that by logic a stale SyncWrite has been also
committed.

Note that in the current implementation both the replicas and commit
state is embedded in the SyncWrite pointed by each replica/commit
iterator. So, given that by logic we remove only unreferenced
SyncWrites, then the tracked container can be empty only before the
first SyncWrite is added for tracking. I.e., stale-removal can remove up
to (container_size - 1) elements.

In terms of handling the iterators; you could simply make any iterator pointing to the item you want to remove instead point to the previous element; if that element doesn't exist then you could simplify by always having a sentinel element at the start of the list which is effectively seqno zero.

About your comments here (and also about those in the parent patch on the need of the commit iterator).
For reaching what you say (remove committed SW immediately and no need of commit iterator), we have to change the way an iterator keeps the state of replica/committed. Currently I use a raw iterator, and the state is embedded in iterator->getBySeqno(). That s why I delete only unreferenced SyncWrites (i.e., I don't lose the state).

A possible solution is to use an IteratorWrapper for tracking the replica seqno, e.g.:

struct IteratorWrapper {
    Container::iterator it;
    int64_t seqno;
}

Doing that:
1) I write the state in seqno, so we have the state even if 'it' has been invalidated (note that I can re-point invalid iterators to container::end(), I can use end() as "sentinel element")
2) So, I can remove all committed SWs
3) But, after committing I have to re-point invalid iterators to the sentinel-element
4) Also, when a new seqnoACK comes I have to move/reset the iterator depending on if it points to the sentinel-element or a SyncWrite.

All that sounds even more complex than what it is now.

Note that currently an iterator points to last ack-received/SW-committed. Maybe changing an iterator to point to /next/ pending ack/commit could help in simplifying the model ? Investigating on that..

Why do you need to know the iterator's seqno? Isn't that implicit in it's position?

Given that whenever there's a seqno_acknowledge message you get told the seqno to advance /to/ you, I don't see why you need the seqno in the iterator. If you do as I suggested you'd just advance it as long as it->seqno is less than seqno_ack.in_memory_seqno.
