DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Remove stale SyncWrites from the tracked container

A SyncWrite is stale if it has been acknowledge by all nodes in the
Replication Chain. By logic, a stale SyncWrite has been also committed.

Note that in the current implementation both the replicas and commit
state is embedded in the SyncWrite pointed by each replica/commit
iterator. So, given that by logic we remove only unreferenced
SyncWrites, then the tracked container can be empty only before the
first SyncWrite is added for tracking. I.e., stale-removal can remove up
to (container_size - 1) elements.
