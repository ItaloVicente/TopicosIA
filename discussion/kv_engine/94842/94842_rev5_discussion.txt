DESCRIPTION:

MB-29915: Provide the ability to switch HT eviction policy at runtime

The hifi_mfu eviction policy is new and has yet to be vigously tested in
"real-life" customer environments.  Therefore we may want to revert to
the original 2-bit_lru policy if a serious issue is found with it.

Given that we currently maintain the counters for the 2-bit_lru policy
and the hfifi_mfu policy, we can switch policies at runtime.  Although
this will not be encouraged (or documented for the end-user) it provides
a fail-safe for Support if the new policy is found to have a severe
adverse effect.

The long term plan is that once we have gained confidence in the new
hifi_mfu eviction policy we will remove the old 2-bit_lru policy and the
ability to switch between the two policies.
