DESCRIPTION:

MB-37881: Create correct number of shards in ep-engine_ep_unit_tests

Currently in ep-engine_ep_unit_tests we set the number of shards
by default to 2. However, we actually create the correct number of
shards based on the WorkLoadPolicy object passed to the EPStore.
This is currently hard coded to 1. Correct this to create the correct
number of shards.

This patch caused a few test failures. The flusher_test attempted to
find the correct flusher object but would find one for a different
shard as the vBuckets no longer map to the same shard. Multiple issues
were found with the collections dcp tests. Primarily the
CollectionsDcpTest::getPersistedManifest() function was incorrectly
always retrieving the collections manifest of vBucket 0. This meant
that comparisons were meaningless. The test now fails because vBucket 0
may be on a different shard that whatever Vbid is passed into the
function. Further issues included not persisting the manifest on the
replica vBucket and not replicating snapshot markers causing
de-duplication of SystemEvents in the CheckpointManager.

Just needs minor cleanup
Line:209, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/collections_dcp_test.cc -> I guess just leftover from debugging

Line:213, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/collections_dcp_test.cc -> I get that this is the reason why you don't use flushVBucketToDiskIfPersistent(vb, expected-num-flushed).
But, given that you expect to "flush everything" then you can check that (flushVBucket().first == false) (ie, moreAvailable == false)

Line:812, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> This seems to change the logic of the test..
In the new version you do cm.add() on a single baseline cm, while before we where re-initializing cm at every loop.
Are we sure that this doesn't invalidate the test?

Line:213, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/collections_dcp_test.cc -> Done

Line:812, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> What the test was doing before was invalid. When we call CollectionsManifest::add we bump the manifestUid by 1. For every iteration of the loop we are recreating the manifest with a fresh uid starting at 0. On all iterations but the last we bump the uid up to 4, and then on the final iteration we only get the manifest uid to 3. The interesting thing here is that the replica accepts a set of collection SystemEvents where the manifest uid goes backwards. I want to fix the test to have the correct logic in this patch, but I've raised MB-37894 for later investigation of why the replica accepts a non-monotonic manifest uid and puts the highest value it sees on disk even though the in memory value is lower.

Line:812, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> Great, thanks for details.

What if we:
1) fix this test as it was invalid and it is supposed to cover MB-26455
2) add another simple test that replicates the invalid behaviour (ie, replica accepts non-monotonic manifestUID)

?

Line:812, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> Reason for (2) is that at least we have something that show the current behaviour and the test would fail as soon as we fix MB-37894
