DESCRIPTION:

MB-34346: Allow pruning of compressed xattrs

The API which prunes documents of non-system xattrs is flawed
when the incoming value is compressed. The code which tests
that the final value will fit in the input buffer triggers
an exception. This happens when the value was compressed,
we decompress the value for pruning, prune out some data
yet the decompressed and final value is still larger.

This is made safe by changing the API so that we don't
re-use the input buffer for output data, instead a
new buffer is returned, which is empty except in the
case when a modified/pruned value is to be returned.
