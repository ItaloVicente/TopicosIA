DESCRIPTION:

MB-34346: Allow pruning of compressed xattrs

The API which prunes documents of non-system xattrs can trigger an
exception when the incoming value is compressed. The  expects that the
final (pruned) value will fit into the input buffer, if not an
exception occurs.

This exception can be made to trigger when the incoming buffer
contains a snappy compressed value. The code decompresses the value
and prunes the xattrs, then fails because in some cases the
decompressed and pruned value is larger than the buffer it arrived in.

This is made safe by changing the API so that we don't re-use the
input buffer for output data, instead a new buffer is returned, which
is empty except in the case when a modified/pruned value is to be
returned.
