DESCRIPTION:

magma-kvstore: Suppress 'maybe-uninitialized' warning in makeItem

GCC 7.3 reports the following warning in MagmaKVStore:

    kv_engine/engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc: In member function 'virtual void MagmaKVStore::getMulti(Vbid, vb_bgfetch_queue_t&)':
    kv_engine/engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc:461:16: '*((void*)& valStr +24)' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
        std::memcpy(&meta, data, sizeof(meta));
        ~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Curiously this only appears /after/ what seems like an unrelated
change to item.h (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/102320/) - I guess
it affected some heuristic limits in the compiler...

Fix by adding a precondition check that the length of the metadata
value is sufficient.

(Needed to tweak the commit message to avoid CV thinking the commit message is actually a warning!)

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: I personally prefer if we nuke this leading path as it doesn't really provide anything useful, and cause the actual information to either be wrapped or cut...
