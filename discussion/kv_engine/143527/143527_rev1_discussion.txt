DESCRIPTION:

MB-43680: Record Snappy decompress times

Time the duration of Snappy decompress called made as part of
executing client requests, recoring the timings to:

* A new trace span.
* A new per-bucket histogram.

The trace span will be reported as part of Slow operation logging -
for example:

    WARNING 57: Slow operation. {...,"trace":"... snappy.decompress=6446937532739980:18555 ...

The histograms will be reported via mctimings using the stat key
'snappy_decompress', this will be added to cbcollect_info via a future
ns_server patch.
