DESCRIPTION:

MB-39297: Disable counting of prepares for magma

As magma is an LSM tree store it can have multiple version of a
given key. During compaction, the compaction callback can be called
multiple times for different versions of the same key. This is an
issue as we attempt to adjust the prepare count (and the document
count) as we visit each prepare.

There does exist a solution to this where we can bg fetch the prepare
to see if it is the most recent during a compaction. This would require
a bunch of code though as we couldn't have the bgfetcher perform writes
so we'd either need to pass this through the CheckpointManager or we'd
need a modified/another flushing task.

The simplest solution though is to simply stop counting prepares for
magma. We can maintain a correct document count for magma if we avoid
trying to count prepares. We can add a magma_dbdump and a prefix
range scan to count the number of prepares during a cbcollect to have
at least some diagnostics.

In a future patch I'll remove the MagmaDBStats prepare counting.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Hey Ben, I not clear to me why we would need the BGFetcher writing at all?
You mention that a possible solution to this problem is to "fetch the prepare to to see if it is the most recent". Where is the write?

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> So the problem here is stat counting. We count the stats on purge of a prepare. For magma there may be an old value for the same key. We need to only count stats for the latest one (and we could check if it's the latest one by doing a bgfetch). Whilst we are doing the bg fetch we can't drop the prepare though or the bg fetch will return nothing. So, we need the bg fetch to either drop the prepare or trigger something else to. I should have written "drop" instead I think. The "write" would be a tombstone drop/delete.
