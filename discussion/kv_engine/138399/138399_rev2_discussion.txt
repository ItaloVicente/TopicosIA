DESCRIPTION:

MB-41914: Only calculate resident percentage when numItems > nonResident

UBSAN flags an issue that occurs when numItems currently less than
nonResident (during warmup).

Old code:

size_t getMemResidentPer() {
    size_t numResident = numItems - nonResident;
    return (numItems != 0) ? (size_t)(numResident * 100.0) / (numItems)
                           : 100;
}

Here 'numItems - nonResident' can result in a negative value (underflow)
resulting in '(size_t)(numResident * 100.0)' being flagged as a failure
as it now cannot be converted back to size_t.

This change only does the calculation when numItems >= nonResident so
we don't generate a large numResident.

Line:64, engines/ep/src/vb_count_visitor.h -> Wondering if it makes more sense to return "0" as resident ratio if numItems is less than nonresident (i.e. in the middle of warmup)?

Feels like if we don't yet know then better to under-promise than over? :philosorapter:

Line:64, engines/ep/src/vb_count_visitor.h -> if only we could return a string we could probably return :thinkingface: emoji 😄

But yeah, since we're changing this function that's an improvement to make above the fix, 100% RR would seem a bit off whilst items was 0

Line:64, engines/ep/src/vb_count_visitor.h -> Reverted this part back to returning 100 for this case - there's a dependency on this behaviour in the access scanner which needs unpicking to resolve - i've commented it to highlight.
