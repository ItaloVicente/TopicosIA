DESCRIPTION:

Cleanup: Remove Connection::addIov

This method didn't add an iovector anymore, but copied the
data into the internal buffers of the bufferevent. Move the
remaining calls to addIov over to the method copying the
data to make it clear that we do copy (look at optimizing
these later on)
