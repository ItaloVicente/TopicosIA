DESCRIPTION:

Expand STParamMagmaBucketTest methods

Expand STParamMagmaBucketTest methods so that we can now specify a
lambda to be called during the post implicit compaction hook.

Also reduce the amount of code replication by making
performWritesForImplicitCompaction() a member of STParamMagmaBucketTest
so we don't need to define it in multiple places.
