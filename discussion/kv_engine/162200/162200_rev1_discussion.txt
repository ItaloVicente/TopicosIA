DESCRIPTION:

Expand STParamMagmaBucketTest methods

Expand STParamMagmaBucketTest methods so that we can now specify a
lambda to be called during the post implicit compaction hook.

Also reduce the amount of code replication by making perform15Writes()
a member of STParamMagmaBucketTest so we don't need to define it in
multiple places.
