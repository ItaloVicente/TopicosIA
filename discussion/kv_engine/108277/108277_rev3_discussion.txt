DESCRIPTION:

MB-32734 [SR]: Restore (committed) SyncDeletes correctly into HT

Once a Prepared SyncDelete has been Committed, it should exist on-disk
as CommitViaPrepare but be marked as deleted. If it needs to be
restored into the HashTable it should also have it's CommitState
restored, however that isn't currently the case.

Fix by setting the commitState of the restored StoredValue from the
(backfilled) Item.

Expand the DurabilityWarmupTest cases to check for this.
