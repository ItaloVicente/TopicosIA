DESCRIPTION:

MB-55391: WIP

An alternate approach would be to implement the "auto remove" logic to
CheckpointCursor itself (in its dtor); then say have CheckpointManager
only hold a weak_ptr to CheckpointCursor (currently holds a
shared_ptr). That would solve the problem at a higher level and for
all uses of Cursor / CheckpointCursor, even after cursor has been
moved from CursorRegResult. For example right now we rely on
ActiveStream's dtor "remembering" to remove the cursor from
CheckpointManager.

While such an approach certainly has merit, I feel it's more invasive
as we would be changing the ownership model of CheckpointManager /
CheckpointCursor, so at this stage in Elixir development, the current
approach - while less "complete" is smaller in scope and at lower risk
of introducing any regressions.
