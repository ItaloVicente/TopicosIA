DESCRIPTION:

MB-25822: Remove unnecessary 'releaseLock' from ConnMap

In MB-25822 we see a DCPConsumer not receiving any message from the
DCPProducer for more than 360 seconds and consequently closing the
connection. Even in the case of a paused connection, a DCPProducer
should send a NOOP message to the consumer every second; the
ConnManager task is responsible for that.

On the producer logs we see that at the time of the disconnection
the ConnManager task shows very slow runtime (> 360 seconds). That
is why a NOOP has not been sent.
The cause of the very slow runtime for the ConnManager task is not clear
yet. But, on the producer logs we see that also the ConnNotifierCallback
task shows the same very long runtime (> 360 seconds).

Looking at the code executed by the ConnManager and the
ConnNotifierCallback we see that both tasks acquire a 'releaseLock'.
ConnManager locks before executing 'notifyIOComplete' on the connection,
so there could be the possibility that one slow task
(ConnNotifierCallback) is slowing down the other (ConnManager), avoiding
the ConnManager to send a NOOP message to the consumer.

We could try to log the time spent by the ConnManager on that lock, but
we found that the 'releaseLock' is not needed at all. That lock is
supposed to guard the release of dead connections. But, at the time of
the release the 'deadConnection' list has been already filled (under
'connsLock' in 'DcpConnMap::disconnect()') with connections pulled from
the global 'CookieToConnectionMap map_'.
So, the ConnNotifierCallback cannot call 'notifyIOComplete' on a
connection that is being released at the same time.

Thus, with this change we remove the 'releaseLock'.
