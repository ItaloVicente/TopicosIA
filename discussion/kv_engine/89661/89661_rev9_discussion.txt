DESCRIPTION:

MB-25822: Remove unnecessary 'releaseLock' from ConnMap

In MB-25822 we see a DCPConsumer not receiving any message from the
DCPProducer for more than 360 seconds and consequently closing the
connection. Even in the case of a paused connection, a DCPProducer
should send a NOOP message to the consumer every second; the
ConnManager task is responsible for that.

On the producer logs we see that at the time of the disconnection
the ConnManager task shows very slow runtime (> 360 seconds). That
is why a NOOP has not been sent.
The cause of the very slow runtime for the ConnManager task is not clear
yet. But, on the producer logs we see that also the ConnNotifierCallback
task shows the same very long runtime (> 360 seconds).

Looking at the code executed by the ConnManager and the
ConnNotifierCallback we see that both tasks acquire a 'releaseLock'.
ConnManager locks before executing 'notifyIOComplete' on the connection,
so there could be the possibility that one slow task
(ConnNotifierCallback) is slowing down the other (ConnManager), avoiding
the ConnManager to send a NOOP message to the consumer.

We could try to log the time spent by the ConnManager on that lock, but
we found that the 'releaseLock' is not needed at all. That lock is
supposed to guard the release of dead connections. But, at the time of
the release the 'deadConnection' list has been already filled (under
'connsLock' in 'DcpConnMap::disconnect()') with connections pulled from
the global 'CookieToConnectionMap map_'.
So, the ConnNotifierCallback cannot call 'notifyIOComplete' on a
connection that is being released at the same time.

Thus, with this change we remove the 'releaseLock'.

Line:133, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> sorry I'm a little confused... Is the test showing there is a problem - or that the scenarios don't need the release lock - and if not why?

Line:133, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Hi Daniel, 
as I showed during our chat, this test is not valid (i.e., it is not testing what we would need to test). 
My aim here was to catch the scenario where a thread can call 'notifyIOComplete()' for a connection that as been released.

What I'm actually doing here is to let TSan to catch an execution where we run the following serial steps:

1) engine->handleDisconnect(cookie);
2) engine->getDcpConnMap().manageConnections();
3) producer->notifyPaused(false);

But, it is completely expected that we access a freed heap memory at step 3) after executing 1) and 2), because 'producer' is a raw pointer.
 
On the other side, what I should do is to test that the *callers* of 'producer->notifyPaused();' have a valid *owning* pointer to the DcpProducer.

Further investigation about this has shown that we have recently made changes on the ownership of DcpProducer/DcpConsumer as part of MB-26470 (e.g. http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/84652/). Because of that I'm not 100% sure yet if the 'releaseLock' can be completely removed or not (mainly because it is seems that the test coverage of this code is poor).

But, the original aim of this change was to minimize (or null if possible) any resource contention between the ConnManager and the ConnNotifierCallback tasks, which I think we can safely do just removing the lock on 'releaseLock' for ConnNotifierCallback. 
So I decided to keep a more conservative approach for now and just do that at http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/90041/.
