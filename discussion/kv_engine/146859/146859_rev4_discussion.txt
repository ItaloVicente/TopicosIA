DESCRIPTION:

MB-44079: Set state of implicit completions received in backfill

Set the state of mutations received after prepares in backfill
snapshots to CommittedViaLogicalCompletion as they should not be
purged (marked stale) until after the prepare has been
purged (removed) or we could skip sending a committed item and
still send the prepare. This could cause us to throw exceptions
in the DurabilityMonitors. In a future patch I will add the purging
logic.
