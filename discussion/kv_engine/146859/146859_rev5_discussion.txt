DESCRIPTION:

MB-44079: Set state of implicit completions received in backfill

Set the state of mutations received after prepares in backfill
snapshots to CommittedViaLogicalCompletion as they should not be
purged (marked stale) until after the prepare has been
purged (removed) or we could skip sending a committed item and
still send the prepare. This could cause us to throw exceptions
in the DurabilityMonitors. In a future patch I will add the purging
logic.

Line:524, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> "in this snapshot..." - don't see the direct relevance of the snapshot in this function - and indeed wouldn't the same problem exist if the prepare was in a previous snapshot?

Line:5468, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> This and the previous test seem identical other than the item being deleted (and checking that in the final expect). Can you avoid the duplication and create a testDurablity... helper function?

Line:5511, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Similarly here

Line:5561, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> And again

Line:5609, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Ditto

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:524, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> I think we would have the same problem on second thought. Updated and remove snapshot constraint
