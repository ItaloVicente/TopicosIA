This is not _essential_ functionality but it's a nice convenience.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Considered boost iterator_facade and preemptively -1'd the idea for pulling in chonky boost headers for not a huge utility.

It's only a mild convenence that comes up every so often; not fussed if we'd rather stick to the existing ways round it.
