Line:651, include/memcached/dcp.h -> Arn't these the callback methods - i.e. they don't send a prepare / commit; they receive them?

Line:651, include/memcached/dcp.h -> Not sure I follow the comment.. There is one method which is called from the engine to _send_ the method, and then there is another method with the same name which is called from the core when a packet is received. All of the first parameters here is exactly the same as when you receive a normal mutation on the DCP stream, except from the two last members. I didn't want to copy the entire section over...

Line:651, include/memcached/dcp.h -> I meant that prepare() & commit() in this class should be documented as "Callback to the engine that a prepare / commit message has been received" - not "Send a commit message" as currently have below.

I'm find with not repeating the details of the arguments etc, just want to make it clear to the reader the high level purpose of the method.
