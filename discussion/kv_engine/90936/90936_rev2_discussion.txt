DESCRIPTION:

Revert "MB-25822: Do not lock on 'releaseLock' when the ConnNofierCallback runs"

This reverts commit 6a1790c56a93c9dc346fa15e5ab1cba314bb3417.

Removing the 'releaseLock' allows 'notifyIOComplete()' to execute twice for the same connection. That should not happen and it seems to be the cause of some crashes seen in MB-28626.
We revert this change to repeat the tests for MB-28626.
