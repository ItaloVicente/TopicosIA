DESCRIPTION:

MB-46827: Remove replication write-queue caps

- replication_throttle_cap_pcnt
- replication_throttle_queue_cap

Legacy and unused (disabled by default).

That was a way of implementing a replication-backoff machanism based on
a threshold on checkpoints.
The current (and more general) plan is to cap the mem-usage of
checkpoints, which is going to implement a backoff mechanism for both
master (frontend ops) and replica (DCP traffic).
