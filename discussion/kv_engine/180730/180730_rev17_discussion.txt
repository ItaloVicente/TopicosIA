DESCRIPTION:

MB-52680: Add support for eviction based on upfront MFU histograms

Adds an alternative implementation of ItemEvictionStrategy, which uses
_just_ the MFU of items to decide what should be evicted.

The MFU is compared to a threshold determined ahead-of-time from the
aggregated histograms of MFU values tracked for evictable items.

Introduces config param item_eviction_strategy, with potential values
 upfront_mfu_only
 learning_age_and_mfu

defaulting to upfront_mfu_only.

Line:234, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> style: redundant after the return in the above clause

Line:27, engines/ep/src/mfu_only_item_eviction.cc -> dead state? I know we will abort elsewhere but maybe this should be a switch statement
