DESCRIPTION:

MB-41514: Use VBReadyQueue in BgFetcher

Currently the BgFetcher unfairly prioritizes lower numbered vBuckets
resulting in higher P99 etc latencies due to higher "wait" times (see
bg_wait histogram).

Test ran was kv_latency_read_1000M_compacted.test on hera.spec.

bg_wait performance:
P50:    46-52us -> 42-48us
P90:    70-74us -> 70-74us
P99:    106-118us -> 98-102us
P99.9:  245-278ms -> 196-221ms
P99.99: 376-393ms -> 327-344ms

Line:134, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> Code as-is is fine, but wondering if you tried popping an element inside the while loop (one at a time) and what results that gave (on master)?

Line:76, engines/ep/src/vb_ready_queue.h -> Nit: `swap` is probably more idiomatic (by my first read of just the function name I thought this just popped a single element).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:134, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> That variation was not as good. No performance gain over current master. Believe lock contention is to blame.
