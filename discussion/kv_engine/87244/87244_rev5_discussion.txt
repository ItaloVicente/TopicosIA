DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: McbpConnection should have an array of cookies

Moving forward we'll allow the clients to run multiple commands
concurrently, so we need to be able to store multiple cookies
with the connection.

For now, we'll use a fixed array with a single slot ;-)

Line:734, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> Could this not be a concrete array (and avoid the indirection cost of the extra pointer)?

Line:734, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> We could probably do that. The primary reason for this solution was that it was easy to find the next available slot (when we're supporting multiple cookies), and that I could flip the backing store to lets say an std::vector etc and it should be possible to grow and shrink without problems..

The Cookie contains a reference to the connection who owns the command (as it cannot be null), so the constructor needs this to be provided. If we want to move to a concrete array we'd have to mess around with that as well ;)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:734, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> I'm just worried about the possible performance impact of adding extra indirection to all command processing.
