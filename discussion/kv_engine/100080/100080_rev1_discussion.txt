DESCRIPTION:

Remove "duplicate" test of delete bucket in conn_send_data

We've got two tests which test that we correctly terminate
connections which is stuck in conn_send_data.

Given that we've got one version working for windows and
one version which only tests the !WIN32 version this
patch removes the one for !WIN32

IIRC this was for a specific DCP issue where it got into ewouldblock. Are you sure this is a duplicate? Other than trying to be tidy, any particular reason to remove this?

The current state diagram for connections is that they inject stuff into the write queue, then moves over to conn_send_data to drain the write queue, and there is where it would be stuck with the transfer failing... when everything is put into the kernel we move over to ship dcp log and tries to build up the iovector before we move over to the send state... 

And this is exactly the same test as we've got in the other test. As part of the patch series moving over to bufferevent the initial patches copies the data ovrer to the bufferevent buffers to keep the patches small and isolated, and finally we're dropping that extra buffer...

Which is the "other" test you're referring to?

So those two tests are associated with different MBs - so I assume that one was created as a regression test given the first one already existed. I think we need to verify exactly why when the original MBs were raised, the "other" test wasn't adequate (and didn't capture the issue) before we delete this one.
