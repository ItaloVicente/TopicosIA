DESCRIPTION:

Improve Checkpoint::isEligibleToBeUnreferenced check

Adds a flag to CheckpointCursor to indicate cursor dropping support.
Use this flag to determine whether a Checkpoint is eligible to be
unreferenced or not, doing this will also stop us from needlessly
dropping cursors from a checkpoint even if one of the cursors
within it does not support this feature.
