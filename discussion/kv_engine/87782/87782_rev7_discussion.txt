DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Cleanup response parsing

Cleanup Response parsing by moving all ntoh/hton conversion of length
values - bodylen and keylen into the Response class. Also added helper
functions to determine the Length and Offsets of
FramingExtras/Extras/Key and Value. Although cas/status fields do need
a similar change, that will be done separately.

Could we split this patch into:

1) the one adding the extra methods to response.h
2) One that calls the setBodylen in the part which is part of the actual product
3) One that refactors the testapp by keeping the data in the packet in network byte order (including the comment I added in client_connection.cc)
Line:480, protocol/connection/client_connection.cc -> This doesn't map with the comment at 466... we should probably refactor the entire stuff out when we do something here...

@Trond,

   It is difficult to split this as there are some code flows using bodylen directly and some that were already using getBodylen. It took me a while to realize I had to do them all together to support the byte splittling of keylen for the tracing. Could you let it slide them together?

   It will be easier to split into 2 commits. One with the changes in Response.h & the other with tesapp using get* funcs.
