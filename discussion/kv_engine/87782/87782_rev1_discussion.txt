DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Cleanup response parsing

Cleanup Response parsing by moving all ntoh/hton conversion of length
values - bodylen and keylen into the Response class. Also added helper
functions to determine the Length and Offsets of
FramingExtras/Extras/Key and Value. Although cas/status fields do need
a similar change, that will be done separately.
