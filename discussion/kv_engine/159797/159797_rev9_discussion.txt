DESCRIPTION:

MB-48010: Only send seqno advance at end of snapshot

Currently if we stream a backfill from a replica that is itself
in the process of receiving a disk snapshot then we may merge
together a backfill and in memory items into a single snapshot.
Currently we are sending multiple seqno advances in this merged
snapshot whereas we should only be sending one (at the end).
