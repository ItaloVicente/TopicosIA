DESCRIPTION:

MB-48010: Only send seqno advance at end of snapshot

Currently if we stream a backfill from a replica that is itself
in the process of receiving a disk snapshot then we may merge
together a backfill and in memory items into a single snapshot.
Currently we are sending multiple seqno advances in this merged
snapshot whereas we should only be sending one (at the end).

Example:

1) A replica e.g. vb:1 is receiving data and concurrently a DCP
   client requests to stream vb:1 and collection c1
2) The replica is being told snapshot {0:100}
3) The DCP client requests data from 0
4) At the time of the request not all of the snapshot has arrived,
   some mutations are still being transmitted to the replica,
   additionally some of the 0 to 100 mutations are flushed to disk
   and no longer in the checkpoint.
5) DCP runs a backfill and reads items 1 to 50 and switches to
   in-memory for the rest (and 51 to 100 are still on the wire)
6) Item 51 arrives and wakes up the DCP checkpoint processor task,
   *item 51 is not in collection c1*
7) Because 51 was not part of collection c1, nothing was pushed to
   the readyQ and we enter that code path (readyQ.empty() == true).
   At this point all of the other checks return true and a seqno
   advance is queued (and lastReadSeqno is updated to the snapshot
   end of 100) This is incorrect, at this point the stream should
   not have queued a seqno advance, we have not reached the end
   of 0:100 snapshot!
8) Now items continue to arrive, and if any of the items 52 to 100
   do belong to collection c1, we will call ActiveStream::snapshot.
   Inside ActiveStream::snapshot lastReadSeqno is updated with the
   value of lastReadSeqnoUnSnapshotted, which will be less or equal
   to the lastReadSeqno value of 100 - this is the Monotonic
   exception seen in this MB.
