DESCRIPTION:

MB-26173 [RocksDB] Move to one DB instance per VBucket

The previous implementation of RocksDBKVStore creates a single RocksDB
instance, thus we have 4 RocksDB instances in total (one per Shard).
With this change, each RocksDBKVStore creates and manages one RocksDB
instance per VBucket, thus we have 1024 RocksDB instances in total.

Line:145, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> If they suggest using a destroy function; then prefer to use a unique_ptr with a custom deleter.

Line:191, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Style: not sure there's much value in adding accessors here. Just make the members public const then you can simply access them directly.

Line:198, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Remove the trailing underscores - if you need to differentiate the name in the constructor, prefer to give the constructor argument "temporary" names (instead of the member variables) - member variables are used more often.

Line:214, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Given this is the only thing you call in the destructor (and I can't see clean() called elsewhere), simpler to just inline clean() here.

Line:305, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> I don't believe it's ever valid to return null here, so prefer returning a reference.

Line:338, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Style - why bother with the temporary and the move - just assign directly to `vbDB`

Line:350, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> You can't put the shardID in the path - if you change shard count then the name will be wrong.

Line:384, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> I'm not convinced you need all this. I think it's simpler to just open the vBuckets you are told about on demand (i.e. when open(vbid) is called). If a vBucket doesn't exist (which was requested) we can simply create it empty.

Line:598, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Style: This is a unique_ptr; prefer simply `vbDB[vbid].reset()`

Line:609, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Isn't there a cleaner way to do this - can we not ask RocksDB to delete it with DestroyDB()?

Line:671, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> I'm not sure you need this method - can't you just convert DocKey to a slice and use that, using the {char*, size} constructor:

 Slice(const char* d, size_t n)

Line:676, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Same here - can't we save creating the temporary and just create a Slice over the existing seqno?

Line:726, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> This allowed to be null? if not, then prefer a reference.

Line:846, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Same as above, prefer reference if null is not valid.

Line:1166, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Seems like it would be cleaner if each vBucket held it's own snapshots.

Line:317, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> Please add comments documenting these functions.

Line:162, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> note that these can be the same e.g. seqnoCFH(seqnoCFH)

Line:384, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Warmup needs the vbstates before it would load data iirc, so I think this is needed? couchstore has similar

Line:850, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> hmm we should add a new task to  promote the JSON creation code to KVStore

Line:384, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Ah, fair point. However it would prefer it if we didn't have to much around with paths etc. 

Can't we just ask RocksDB if the database exists - for example using options.create_if_missing==false? That feels much more robust than us trying to muck around with it's paths etc.

How would that resolve the loading of vbstates in `initialize`?
 http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/84318/6/engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc@298

It seems there is no way of knowing what VBuckets each KVStore owns from inside the KVstore itself. 
Maybe we can retrieve this information from KVShard::vbuckets ?

Line:384, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Oh right, sorry didn't get it. I'll try with `options.create_if_missing==false`

Line:384, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> The behaviour of rocksdb::DB::Open(<options>) when `options.create_if_missing==false` is:
1) if the database exists, create an instance of rocksdb::DB;
2) if the database does not exist, throw an exception.
Thus, it does not help as we fall in 1) with multiple Shards seeing the DB for the same VBID, and trying to open it.
Looking for another solution.

Line:609, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Yes we can. `DestroyDB` considers also the case where the DB is split in multiple subfolders (maybe we do not need that, but it is the cleanest way to proceed anyway).

Line:1166, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> I reverted this to the original code. I'm considering to amend this again in a separate change.
