DESCRIPTION:

MB-26173 [RocksDB] Move to one DB instance per VBucket

The previous implementation of RocksDBKVStore creates a single RocksDB
instance, thus we have 4 RocksDB instances in total (one per Shard).
With this change, each RocksDBKVStore creates and manages one RocksDB
instance per VBucket, thus we have 1024 RocksDB instances in total.
