DESCRIPTION:

MB-34148: Return SYNC_WRITE_AMBIGUOUS during takeover

When we do takeover (vBucket active->dead) we should return
SYNC_WRITE_AMBIGUOUS to all clients because they will just timeout
as the vBucket is now dead and need to reconnect to the new active.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> By DesignDoc, the other way for solving this problem is to wait for Prepares to complete before we switch from TakeoverSend to TakeoverWait, which increases the TakeoverSend phase runtime.
Which in turn could lead to timing-out Prepares.

Is my understanding correct? Could we add this details in case?

Also, not clear to me what is the current behaviour (ie, before this fix):
1) client connected to A1
2) Prepare in-flight
3) takeover A1 -> A2
4) A1 set to dead
5) (not sure about this) client->A1 connection dropped/closed ? maybe the SDK just throws an exception?

Line:574, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> DM doesn't know anything about takeover, probably this should just be named 'abortAll'

Line:123, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> Again, not sure about this.
Discussing on the commit message, please ignore my comment if that's correct.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Add details to design doc/commit message/comments?

1) client connected to A!
2) Prepare in-flight
3) takeover A1 -> A2
4) A1 set to dead
4a) A1 ignores any ack (if it gets one) 
Either:
5) Client eventually times out waiting for server response (vBucket remains in dead state but still referenced)
5) We respond with NOT_MY_VBUCKET (if we start to delete the vBucket object)

Line:574, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> I am not sure about the name either but abortAll would imply that we are aborting all the SyncWrites which we are not :)

Maybe "respondAmbiguous" better describes what we do

Line:574, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Ok on the first point (abortAll is misleading), but why you needed to add a new task + all the other stuff in patchset2 ? I suggested just a name change for this function :)

Line:574, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> I just uploaded to get initial CV result, I never intended on doing the change without the task so I didn't add reviewers until after ;)

The changed should be reviewed just as patchset 2.

We want to do the notify in a separate task so that we do not slow down vBucket state change if we have a lot of in flight SyncWrites.
