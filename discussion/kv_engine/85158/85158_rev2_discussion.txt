DESCRIPTION:

MB-26631: Check if value requires modification at response creation

When a DCP response is created from a item from backfill or from the
checkpoint, the value or xattrs needs to be pruned or the item in
itself needs to be compressed/decompressed. A new item is created
in order to modify the value and then create a DCP response. It would
be pointless to create a copy of the item if the value doesn't require
any modification. Thus, create a copy of the item only if the value
needs modification.

Please also add a unit test for this - verifying that we only create copies exactly when we should.
Line:968, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> I think this can be const.

Line:968, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Please add a comment describing this function.

Line:992, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> You can simplify this to:

 (isCompressionEnabled != mcbp::datatype::is_snappy(item->getDataType())

Line:1007, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Feels like it would be clearer to default to false, if none of the reasons why we need to modify are true - so if you flip the condition at line 1001 this can be `return false`.

Line:1017, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Style: This is a good place to use `auto` - given the RHS of the expression already tells us the type of finalItem.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:979, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> No need to change, but the early-return style is fine (and can often make the code clearer), so you could have kept this as it was :)
