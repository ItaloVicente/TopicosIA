DESCRIPTION:

MB-24461: Add corresponding cb mutex exit

While working on moving mock_get to use do_blocking_engine_call rather
than call_engine_and_handle_EWOULDBLOCK, it became clear that some tests
were deadlocking due to a mutex not being exited. This patch addresses
the specific issue that caused this.
