DESCRIPTION:

MB-53304: Enforce holding of stateLock in VBucket::queueItem [4/n]

MB-53304 suggests we ensure that the stateLock is held by passing a ref
to it in queueItem (and the call hierarchy of queueItem).

This change ensures we hold a lock on the VBucket state while updating
scopes and collections.

In a future change I will pass this ref down to queueItem.
