DESCRIPTION:

MB-40980: Add support for $document macro expansion

To check for the availability for the macros the client may
try to request SubdocDocumentMacroSupport as part of HELO. If
returned the client may use $document in the macro expansion
to reference the documents metadata (before they get updated
as part of "committing" the mutation.

All paths returned as part of a lookup of the $document virtual
attribute may be requested (including the full $document):

   "${$document}"
   "${$document.CAS}"
   "${$document.flags}"
   "${$document.vbucket_uuid}"
   "${$document.seqno}"
   "${$document.exptime}"
   +++
