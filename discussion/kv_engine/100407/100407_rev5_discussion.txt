DESCRIPTION:

MB-31978: Add StreamContainer and unit tests

StreamContainer is a custom container designed for use by the
DcpProducer so that it can enable the multiple streams per VB feature.
The class is templated primarily to simplify testing and is not
attempting to be a generic container.

A StreamContainer default constructs to store a single element, as that
is how the DcpProducer will initialise a vbucket.

A StreamContainer exposes a thread-safe API and internally uses shared
locking to enable multiple readers. A read API is exposed via a
ReadLockedHandle obtained by calling lock() and a  write API is exposed
via WriteLockedHandle obtained by calling wlock().

The ReadLockedHandle and WriteLockedHandle both also expose iteration
methods begin()/end()/next() so that the elements of the container can
be iterated.

To support the DcpProducer a ResumableIterationHandle can be obtained by
calling startResumable(). A ResumableIterationHandle is an object which
provides an iteration style interface, but crucially remembers the
current position, this allows the user to begin iterating the elements
and destruct their ResumableIterationHandle and later resume from where
they had previously iterated to (providing that the StreamContainer
membership hasn't changed).

Examples of ResumableIterationHandle

If the container store integers 5, 4, 3, 2 and 1 an initial loop (begin
to end) yields:

   54321

A new ResumableIterationHandle will from 5, but assume this time we
break the loop 3 is returned:

   543 <break>

The next ResumableIterationHandle will start from 2 and will end when a
complete cycle of the elements occurred:

Now a new loop will start from 2 and would return true from complete
when a full cycle has completed, e.g.

   21543

Resuming iteration this time again starts from 2:

   21543

Note1: only a single resume point is maintained, so if two threads were
creating ResumableIterationHandle from the same StreamContainer, they
will be interfering with each others resume point.

Note2: Inserting elements or removing them from the StreamContainer
resets the resume point.

Mostly clarifying questions / some minor suggestions...
Line:60, /COMMIT_MSG -> Would it not be preferable to store the resumePoint in the ResumableIterationHandle object, ensuring that different threads don't conflict with each other?

It may also make the responsibilities more explicit - StreamContainer is just a container; the iterators are the things which maintain state of where they got up to previously.

(Wondering if we should just bite the bullet and get folly working; so we can use things like https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/ConcurrentSkipList.h which might simplify the implementation of this (allows adding / removing while iterator holds onto items for example)...

Line:72, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream_container.h -> Does erasing elements invalidate iterators? If so worth documenting.

Line:122, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream_container.h -> Probably more ideomatic to make this constructor private; and have the StreamContainer itself create ResumableIterationHandles via a begin() or similar method.

Line:280, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream_container.h -> What is the expected Element type - do we want a Element&& overload to avoid a copy if constructing the element straight into the container?

Line:60, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's not a huge problem that only one resume point is stored, only one thread uses it, changing it adds more work and iirc gives a number of other challenges plus test code to simulate many resume points

Line:72, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream_container.h -> will update - removing == erase

Line:122, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream_container.h -> wil check that, constructed via startResumable (other handles also have a factory method)

Line:280, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream_container.h -> expected type is shared_ptr<Stream>

Line:60, /COMMIT_MSG -> Also regarding the reset, I don't see that as a problem which needs a different underlying container, only DcpProducer::getNextItem uses the resume iterator, and it will only be reset if the client adds more streams or streams close, which seems rare in the lifetime of a producer

Line:60, /COMMIT_MSG -> ok, thanks for the clarification.

Line:280, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream_container.h -> I guess we'll not actually be adding/removing elements that frequently so probably no need for a rvalue reference overload.
