DESCRIPTION:

MB-47462: Introduce dedicated checkpoint destruction task

As a first step towards "eager" checkpoint removal, this patch
introduces a new CheckpointDestroyerTask.

This task receives ownership of checkpoints, and destroys them as soon
as possible. The task only runs when checkpoints have been queued for
destruction.

For now, this is a seemingly unnecessary level of indirection - the
CheckpointVisitor now queues checkpoints for a different task to
destroy, rather than destroying them immediately.

However, this separation will, in later patches, allow checkpoints to
be queued as soon as they become unreferenced (e.g., by cursor
movement). This will not require the CheckpointVisitor to scan all
vbuckets.

Line:141, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Probably about time we documented the ctor :)

Line:173, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Is having both this and the proceeding method temporary? It feels like the policy of what do to with closed unreferenced checkpoints should be owned by the CheckpointManger, not by the caller's decision. i.e. the presence of absence of a CheckpointRemver should probably dicrate where the removed checkpoints end up, if we want to continue to support two modes...

Line:560, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Feels that the Disposer shouldn't be logically const given we are transferring ownership of data into it?

Line:16, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.h -> Spinlocks are evil, don't use ;)

Seriously, they are rarely if ever a good idea in userspace, even for "short" locked regions - if the thread owning the spin lock gets de-scheduled while the lock is held, it degenerates badly as the OS has no knowledge of which thread had it locked. Additionally other threads waiting on a spin lock can not be queued efficiently by the OS (with an OS-aware lock like std::mutex, when the owning thread unlocks the OS can deschedule that thread and scheduling the waiting thread. A spin lock cannot do any of this.

Line:992, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> What's the iteration count / runtime like on this?

Line:163, executor/fake_executorpool.h -> Might be worth explaining _why_ it schedules a variable number of tasks.

Line:58, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.h -> What's the original reason for using SpinLock in place of the default SharedMutex?

Line:851, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Maybe you wanted to return shared_ptr<T> (if you want the caller to take shared ownership) or just CheckpointDestroyerTask& otherwise ?

Line:992, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> +
setting some like quota(10MB) and value(1MB) is one simple way of keeping the runtime under control - some tests around do that

Line:141, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Done

Line:173, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Indeed - just for transitioning tests; will poke them all about and remove background.

Line:560, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> method removed

Line:16, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.h -> Done

Line:18, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.h -> I made the right choice once, but at some point yolo'd a spinlock in there :badpokerface:

Line:58, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.h -> not really a R/W workload as all uses will modify the list. There's investigation of lock free queue alternatives to this planned.

SpinLock specifically - none!

Line:851, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Done

Line:992, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> The upper mark is dropped above, but I've moved to dropping the quota and ratio if that's preferred
Bumped the item size, now around 50 iterations, runtime ~20ms on a tired mac.

Line:163, executor/fake_executorpool.h -> Done
