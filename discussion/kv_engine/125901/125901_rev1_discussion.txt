DESCRIPTION:

MB-38673: Add new Privilege failure for no privileges

Add a new failure code to privilege checks which lets the caller
distinguish between a failure because the privilege wasn't found and a
failure where not only is the privilege not found but the user has no
privileges for the scope/collection.

This differentiation is important for returning an appropriate error
code.

* No privileges makes the collection invisible. Status::FailNoPrivileges
* Privileges but a failure means the collection is visible (given the
  correct operation) and the current operation can be failed with a no
  access error. Status::Fail

Internally to the privilege database the following logic is used to
return Fail or FailNoPrivileges.

* The Bucket counts how many privileges in its set are collection
  privileges (the bucket can have both collection privileges e.g. Read
  and non collection e.g. Audit)
 - A collection privilege at the Bucket means every collection in the
   system gets that privilege, e.g. Read := you can Read everything.
 - When Bucket::check cannot find a requested collection privilege and
   no scope/collection search is possible it decides the error using the
   count of collection privileges - the rule being, >0 privileges makes
   collections visible.
* The Scope::check now accepts a new parameter, which is the number of
  collection privileges found in the parent (the Bucket)
 - The Scope can itself have an empty privilege set in the case where it
   is just a conduit from Bucket to Collection.
 - If the Scope::check fails it uses the count of its own privileges and
   the count of the parent privileges to determine Fail or
   FailNoPrivileges.
* The Collection::check is unchanged - the assumption is that the
  Collection privilege set should not be empty (now checked in
  construction)
 - With the set always storing at least one collection privilege, if you
  reach Collection::check the only error can be Fail.
