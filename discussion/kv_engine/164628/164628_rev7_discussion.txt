Please also update stats.org
Line:483, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Maybe rename to getMemoryOverheadTotal (to make more explicit it is the sum of the ones below)?

Line:492, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Can we document this one and the next one more explicitly; and how they differ? Maybe rename them to be more explicit on how they vary?

Line:426, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> As previous, I think it's worth adding explicit details on what these define. 

Think about what happens when 3 months from now, someone sees an "interesting" value in one of these stats and wants to understand what it means...

Done
Line:483, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Done

Line:492, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> This can be named getMemOverheadIndexInternals() or something like that, if that sounds better. Probably better option is to keep the existing name and just document the func properly.

Line:426, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Done
