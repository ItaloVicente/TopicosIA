DESCRIPTION:

MB-32330: Add support for validating SetVbucket with extended data

The SetVbucket may contain 3 different encodings:

 1) extras contain the vbucket state in 4 bytes (pre MadHatter). Dataype
    must be RAW
 2) body may contain the vbucket state in 4 bytes (ns_server in pre
    MadHatter). Datatype must be RAW
 3) No Extras, but the body contains a JSON payload containing the
    information. Introduced in MadHatter. "state" is a mandatory item
    in there, but we don't validate that (nor that the payload is valid
    JSON) as we would have to drop the entire object and redo the entire
    parsing when we execute the command.

Change-Id: I621c86a8ae752eb6d56bad81bf70581ea3d5a485
