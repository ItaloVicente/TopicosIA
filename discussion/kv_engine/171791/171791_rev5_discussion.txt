DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Distinguish KVStore::scan failure vs abort

KVStore::scan currently returns 3 status codes.

* scan_success
* scan_again
* scan_failed

With these 3 status codes there's no way for a scan to signal it cannot
continue for some state change (non fatal), e.g. vbucket or stream
closing. This limitation leads to an inefficiency that means a scan
keeps on scanning the index, even though it is doing so pointlessly.
For example when the vbucket goes away the callback sets status to
engine_errc::success and returns from the callback, yet KVStore::scan
will just keep invoking the callback for all items in the index.
A better solution is to return an appropriate status and allow
that to get KVStore::scan to stop without triggering critical logging or
increment failover stats.

This commit makes use of a linked couchstore change and refactors scan
so that the following 4 codes can now be returned.

* ScanStatus::Success
    - The scan successfully scanned all items

* ScanStatus::Yield
    - The scan has been requested to yield due to a temporary issue,
      currently this means DCP is out of buffer space

* ScanStatus::Aborted
    - The scan cannot continue, e.g. the vbucket or stream has gone away

* ScanStatus::Failed
    - The scan failed, this is used for when couchstore hits an error,
      e.g. some system call error or data integrity issue.

With these changes, the scan can be brought to a halt as soon as one of
the scan callbacks detects the vbucket state change, setting an
appropriate couchstore code which then triggers the use of Aborted.

magma and rocks have similar changes to return Aborted but don't require
changes in the library code due to the way a scan is structured entirely inside
kv-engine code

Line:36, /COMMIT_MSG -> What do you think to "Cancelled" or "Halted" instead? "Aborted" implies a failure of some form - e.g. from the OED:

> abort: 
> bring to a premature end because of a problem or fault.
> "the flight crew aborted the take-off"

"Cancelled" (or some other synonym which implies a normal, non-error situation) I think feels more natural to not log as an error condition.

Line:157, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_id_disk.cc -> To my previous comment :) - I note that we use "cancelled" here to refer to a "completed" backfill which did not send all the items originally expected.

Line:1849, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Is this a behaviour change, or just a refactor in line with the new status codes and their handling?

Line:2365, engines/ep/src/kvstore/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Similary here - is this a behaviour change? If so I think it's worth pulling into its own change (also with the previous one I commented if that is also behaviour changing) so it's easier to reason about this patch as purely a refactoring which shouldn't change externally-visible behaviour.

Line:67, engines/ep/src/kvstore/kvstore_iface.h -> Style: If you add a trailing comma to "Failed" (which is valid in ~C++11) then we probably won't have to touch the "Failed" line if/when we add any more enum values to this.

Line:581, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Note - if you add an operator<< for ScanStatus instead of / in addition to to_string(), then fmtlib can pretty-print it without the explicit to_string() call around it.

Similary you also get pretty-printed values in GTest EXPECT macros.

Line:1849, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Previous code didn't care for the !success status but when we set no_such_key in the new code it triggered the abort (aka cancelled) path and stopped the rollback - unit tests flagged this.

Line:2365, engines/ep/src/kvstore/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Yes this is, I noted by-id scan had the increment and synced them - will separate.
