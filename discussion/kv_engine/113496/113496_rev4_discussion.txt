DESCRIPTION:

MB-35599: Warmup dead vbuckets

Revert change made in b379c252 which skipped warmup of dead vbuckets and
make further changes so that all vbuckets warmup.

The justification behind this is that skipping a vbucket in dead or
pending state is risking data loss, dead does not mean deleted, and a
dead vbucket can transition to replica, and as such a warmup should not
mean a replica rebuild.

Pending is similar, a pending vbucket may next become a replica
vbucket, if we warmup and effectively discard pending vbuckets we are
discarding data which has a valid destiny.
