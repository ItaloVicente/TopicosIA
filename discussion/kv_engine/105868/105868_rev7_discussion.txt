DESCRIPTION:

Cleanup warmup.h/warmup.cc prior to SyncWrite support

Cleanup warmup.h and warmup.cc before changes for synchronous
replication:

- Remove unnecessary headers / move to .cc
- Remove code only required in warmup.cc from warmup.h; moving to .cc
- Use compiler-generated default ctor / dtor where possible.
- move public functions only accessed by internal tasks to private;
  granting friendship to those tasks so they can still access.
