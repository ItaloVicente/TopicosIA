DESCRIPTION:

MB-34094,MB-34120: Fix on disk stats underflow and add unit tests

Fix underflow of onDiskTotalItems in EPVBucket seen in MB-34120 and an
underflow of diskCount in ManifestEntry which stores the number of items
on disk for a given collection, which was observed in MB-34094.

This bug is due to us not correctly incrementing
EPVBucket::onDiskTotalItems every time insert a new mutation on disk,
which should include prepares. As they should be treated a new separate
document items to a committed document, due to the fact that couch-store
and our other storage engines have no consept of the relationship
between a prepare and a committed document.

To fix this, we've modified the set PersistenceCallback to increment
onDiskTotalItems for all prepare sets as well as a new key commits.
Also we only remove the new cache item flag when we observe a
committed mutation. Furthermore, when looking up the persisted item
from the HashTable during the set or delete PersistenceCallback's (in
the case of delete this happens in VBucket::deletedOnDiskCbk which is
called by the delete PersistenceCallback). We search for the correct
pending / committed document, instead of using fetchValidValue which
will return Committed or Pending depending on the state of the
HashTable. Also, if findOnlyPrepared() dose not return an item, but
the queued time is pending and the mutation status passed to the set
call back is KVStore::MutationSetResultState::Insert then we also
increment the on item count. As this implies the item isn't available
in the HashTable right now but we have just written a new prepare to
disk.

This patch also adds a set of unit tests to verify that our accounting
of the number of documents on disk are correct.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Style: generally written as "couchstore".

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> This was a bit hard to follow. Can you try to re-phase to make clearer?

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> concept

Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> Again, this sentence seems to stop abruptly - can you re-word?

Line:32, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Is this necessary? I wouldn't have thought that couch-kvstore.cc should directly know about the specific ep-engine persistence callback type.

Line:2029, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> I don't quite follow why this is needed - the keyStats map defaults to false (new document) in CouchKVStore::saveDocs, so why do we need this code here?

Line:63, engines/ep/src/persistence_callback.cc -> This isn't necessarily true - there _can_ be separate Prepared and Committed StoredValues, assuming that the Prepared item cannot be committed until it's been persisted to disk for example.

Line:68, engines/ep/src/persistence_callback.cc -> Not sure this is correct - given NewCacheItem is used to determine if a StoredValue should be counted or not, I think we should be considering it for both prepared and committed StoredValues (given both are counted in total items).

Line:583, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> ... ?

Line:594, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> ditto

Line:654, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> Lots of repetition here (2x SyncWrite). can you pull the repeated code into some helper functions please?

Line:700, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> tracked

Line:705, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> an

Line:820, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> Similar in this test - this looks basically the same the first half of the function. Can you pull this into some helper functions please?

Line:922, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> Same comment as previous

Line:1058, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> ditto

Line:1064, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> Why 20? Can we achieve the same effect with fewer iterators?

Line:1086, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> Why 10? Can we achieve the same effect / coverage with fewer?

Line:1136, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> Ditto. 

If you're running purely synchronously (as we are here) and control the flusher explicitly, why do we need 200 iterations - what does it give us which 2 iterations doesn't?
