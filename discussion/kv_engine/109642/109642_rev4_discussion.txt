DESCRIPTION:

MB-34094,MB-34120: Fix on disk stats underflow and add unit tests

Fix underflow of onDiskTotalItems in EPVBucket seen in MB-34120 and an
underflow of diskCount in ManifestEntry which stores the number of items
on disk for a given collection, which was observed in MB-34094.

This bug is due to us not correctly incrementing
EPVBucket::onDiskTotalItems every time insert a new mutation on disk,
which should include prepares. As they should be treated a new separate
document items to a committed document, due to the fact that couch-store
and our other storage engines have no consept of the relationship
between a prepare and a committed document.

To fix this we the set PersistenceCallback increment onDiskTotalItems
for all prepare sets as well as a new key commits. Also we only remove
the new cache item flag when we observe a committed mutation.
Furthermore, when looking up the persisted item from the HashTable
during the set or delete PersistenceCallback's (in the case of delete
this happens in VBucket::deletedOnDiskCbk which is called by the delete
PersistenceCallback). We search for the correct pending / committed
document, instead of using fetchValidValue which will return Committed
or Pending depending on the state of the HashTable.

This patch also adds a set of unit tests to verify that our accounting
of the number of documents on disk are correct.
