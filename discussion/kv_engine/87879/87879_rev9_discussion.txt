Line:145, protocol/connection/client_mcbp_commands.cc -> style: we typically put the variable first and what we want to compare that to. I know that the above style is preferred by some people as the constant can't be assigned to (and would yield compiler error when used = instead of ==), but we should try to keep our source consistent (and compilers typically emits warnings anyways and our CI system complains if we add new warnings).

Line:154, protocol/connection/client_mcbp_commands.cc -> const?

Line:379, protocol/connection/client_mcbp_commands.h -> The method should be documented (in addition I'm not sure if I like the term "trace data" as it only returns the execution time).

The method should probably return an "optional" as:

1) Trace could not be enabled on the server (so trying to enable it failed)
2) The trace could not be present in the response if the server didn't inject it.
3) 0 isn't an illegal value as for sub-microseconds executions.

Line:38, tests/testapp/testapp_tracing.cc -> Do we want to split this test into separate test cases for with and without? And perhaps one where the server has the feature disabled?

Line:154, protocol/connection/client_mcbp_commands.cc -> Done

Line:379, protocol/connection/client_mcbp_commands.h -> I'll add documentation to it. It is called tracingdata,traceinfo all over, this may not be a good time to change the name. I'll also see how to add the optional data as a separate commit, tad tricky though.

Line:38, tests/testapp/testapp_tracing.cc -> Done
