The problem with the code as it stands today is that your test will pass even if you enable the feature, but the server doesn't send it in the response. If someone mess up the server code so that the response won't be included the test wont catch that situation.

But the test case is broken due to the face that we use the value as "not present". This is where the boost::optional comes in where we know that the value is present, and it is a submicrosecond resolution (instead of returning 0 just because it wasn't present)
