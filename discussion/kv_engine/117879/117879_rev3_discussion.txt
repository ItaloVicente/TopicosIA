DESCRIPTION:

MB-36887: Perf: Split keyIndex into separate indexes for prepared & committed

MB-34685 (commit 257fbd353) added the ability to have prepares and
commits (to the same key) in the same checkpoint; to be consistent
with Disk snapshots.

To implement this the keyIndex (an unordred_map from StoredDocKey to
index_entry) was modified so the 'key' was a pair of (StoredDocKey,
CheckpointIndexKeyNamespace):

    enum class CheckpointIndexKeyNamespace : uint8_t {
        Committed = 0,
        Prepared,
    };

    using CheckpointIndexKey = std::pair<StoredDocKey,
                                         CheckpointIndexKeyNamespace>

Functionally this is fine, however it introduces a number of temporary
heap allocations due to the need to create temporary
CheckpointIndexKey objects when calling checkpoint_index::find().

Recall that an Item contains a StoredDocKey, so before
CheckpointIndexKey was added, it was possible to search
checkpoint_index via find(const StoredDocKey&) without creating a
temporary.

However, when the key was changed to CheckpointIndexKey it is
necessary to create a temporary CheckpointIndexKey object to pass to
find(). This typically requires a heap allocation as StoredDocKey is
internally a std::string and most keys exceed the internal buffer of
std::string (16 bytes on libstdc++). This heap allocation is freed
immediately after find() returns and hence we also pay for a heap
free.

Avoid this extra heap cost by splitting keyIndex into separare indexes
for prepared and commit keys, checking the appropriate index for the
given queued_item.

Not only does this avoid the extra heap alloc/free; but it also
reduces the memory footprint of checkpoint_index - the key type is now
just sizeof(StoredDocKey) and not sizeof(CheckpointIndexKeyNamespace)
- which due to alignment is generally a rection from 32B to 24B.
