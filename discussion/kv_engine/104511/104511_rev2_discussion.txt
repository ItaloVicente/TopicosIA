DESCRIPTION:

CBD-2800,MB-32907,MB-32908,MB-32908: Convert kv_engine to Python3

Take three.

This reverts commit 7de655eb04e73e0370d08d4ff898f72ba8d1cfc7. It also
includes fixes for issues encountered during previous attempts:

MB-32907: cbstats: Fix incorrect usage of bytes for str values
==============================================================

- list_buckets() - Bucket names are UTF-8 strings, so convert from
  bytes to string before returning.

- stats() Stat keys and values are UTF-8 strings, so convert from
  bytes.

MB-32908: kv_trace_dump fails after Python3 upgrade
===================================================

Update the search logic used to find the helper binary mcctl.

MB-32909: Fix 'cbstats tasks' formatting for Python3
====================================================

Two issues were found:

- __format__ of `object` raises a TypeError if passed a non-empty
  string[1]. This causes Column and Task classes to throw that error
  as they don't implment __format__ themselves. Fix by implementing
  it.

- An extra decimal place was printed on the timestamps. Not sure the
  exact Python3 change which caused this, but fix by coercing to an
  int().

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> is this supposed to be MB-32909?

Also, MB-32896 seems to be addressed with this change (on patchset 2 the regression is fixed)

Good spot, thanks.

It looks like MB-32896 is a dupe of MB-32907 - I've updated it as such in Jira.
