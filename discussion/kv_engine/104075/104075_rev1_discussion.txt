DESCRIPTION:

Update output options of JenkinsLogSearch script

This commit adds two new choices of output of the result of the
search.
--log-line (or -l) will give the link as normal, but also
append the line of the log that contained the search term.
--jira-format will provide a readable format for pasting into
jira messages

Line:42, scripts/jenkins_console_log_search.py -> Maybe prefer a --format=plain|jira option; that's more future-proofed if you add a additional formats down the line.

Line:81, scripts/jenkins_console_log_search.py -> No no no ;) You've just made this take at least 0.5 to execute!

stdout and stderr arn't interlocked by default; if you really want to flush stderr before printing to stdout (which I don't is really that important) then just issue a flush() on the appropriate file descriptor(s).

Line:112, scripts/jenkins_console_log_search.py -> stderr ?
