DESCRIPTION:

[SR] Pass durability::Requirements by ref

Change EngineIface to pass durability::Requirements objects by
reference. While they are only small (4 Bytes), passing by value
requires the definition of them (i.e. durability_spec.h) to be
included by engine.h, and by transitive relation pretty much every
file in kv_engine.
