DESCRIPTION:

MB-55694: Update replicaHTMemory stat when destroying Ephemeral VB

We currently do not update the replicaHTMemory stat when we destroy an
ephemeral vBucket and that can result in us failing to track memory
usage correctly and failing to run the item pager when we should.

This was spotted in the rollback case which deletes vBuckets if we
rollback to zero (we always roll back to zero for ephemeral vBuckets).

Line:98, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Would it be more "correct" to put this in the HashTable's dtor, given it's the one which normally updates replicaHTMemory?

Line:269, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/ephemeral_bucket_test.cc -> I believe this is indirectly asserting that replicaHTMemory is zero - clear to just assert that explicitly? Or perhaps have another replica vBucket (with some items in it) which isn't rolled back and the total now just includes that vb?
