DESCRIPTION:

Change Iterator from a list to a dequeue

To help reduce memory usage we want to be able to remove items from the
checkpoint queue where all cursors are to the right (i.e. the items have
been processed).  This can be achieved more easily when using a deque.

As part of the patch de-duplicate items are no longer removed from the
checkpoint queue, but instead they are set to a nullptr and the entry
in the checkpoint remains so we do not require any special iterator
manipulation.  When iterating (for example when flushing to disk) we
simply skip past any entries in the checkpoint queue that have a
nullptr.

It would also be good to track the memory change due to this. 

What I was thinking is you could first make the checkpoint memory tracking more accurate by accounting for the actual size of the std::list elements - say by providing an Allocator template param to std::list (and then later std::deque) which tracks how much memory is allocated for the nodes; and then that memory is included in the checkpoint memory usage.

I saw this nice example of making a custom allocator: https://howardhinnant.github.io/allocator_boilerplate.html

When we flip to deque we should see this memory usage drop as there's no longer the cost of each list node.
Line:30, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Do we need list anymore?

Line:62, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Prefer `using` for type-aliases.

Line:32, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> Note you can remove the second template parameter and just use what the underlying container provides under size_type - e.g. for deque: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/deque

Line:38, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> Can the container be null? If not then prefer a reference.

Line:42, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> One advantage of using Container::size_type is it should always be unsigned so you can remove this.

Line:54, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> NIt: can be const.

Line:68, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> Do we actually need operator-- for Checkpoint - I didn't think cursors moved backwards?

Line:93, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> I think https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/out_of_range is more idiomatic.

Line:109, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> This looks non-standard (i.e. normal iterators don't support it). Given you can get essentially the same from it->reset() I'd remove it to simplify the interface.

Line:97, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> You should be able to keep this (and in fact that would be a good test that your iterator is compatibile with the standard ones.

Line:648, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Similary; I don't think you should need this as you have an operator* for your iterator.

As suggested - will raise separate patch to track memory usage of actual data structure.
Line:30, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> removed.

Line:62, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Done

Line:32, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> Done

Line:38, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> Need to copy e.g. metaKeyIndex[qi->getKey()] = entry; (in checkpoint.cc)
(entry is an index_entry which is comprised of ChkptQueueIterator and int64_t)

Line:42, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> Done

Line:54, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> Done

Line:68, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> Yes we still need where we fail to move to the next checkpoint or discover we have hit the end and need to come back by one - see checkpoint_manager.cc

Line:93, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> Done

Line:109, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> Done

Line:97, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Done

Line:648, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:38, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_iterator.h -> I would have thought you can copy references. If not, then at least use gsl::not_null<> to mark it cannot be null.
