DESCRIPTION:

MB-50984: Move KVBucket::checkpointMaxSize to CheckpointConfig

CheckpointConfig is the natural place for that quantity.
Plus, moving it CheckpointConfig will allow to exploit the param in
Checkpoint/VBucket component tests where there is no KVBucket.

Change-Id: If55c3941df6dd251c4e0c20aa08340d811af67b8
