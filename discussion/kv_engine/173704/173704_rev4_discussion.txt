DESCRIPTION:

MB-50984: Move KVBucket::checkpointMaxSize to CheckpointConfig

CheckpointConfig is the natural place for that quantity.
Plus, moving it CheckpointConfig will allow to exploit the param in
Checkpoint/VBucket component tests where there is no KVBucket.

Line:52, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_config.cc -> I think that this is fine as the code currently stands, but it feels like there is a reasonable possibility for us to introduce a race here when config.getCheckpointMaxSize() == 0 if we fail to call autoConfigure... after.

Does it make more sense to store a ref to Configuration in here and move autoConfigure... into CheckpointConfig?

So with "race" you mean the fact that if autoConfigure fails we end up with an unexpected configuration? If that's your point then yes, but that more theoretical than actual, as if you look at the code for autoConfig there's nothing that can fail (apart from some early exit that we can hit only in the middle of a bucket initialization).

And let's consider the worst case: checkpointMaxSize stays set to some default value - which is a potential issue also before this change.


> Does it make more sense to store a ref to Configuration in here and move autoConfigure... into CheckpointConfig?

That would make sense indeed from the PoV of the owner of checkpoint_max_size (which is CheckpointConfig in this patch), but the autoConfig() is logically a KVBucket procedure as that computations accounts for the KVBucket internal state (eg, the number of non-dead vbuckets in the VBMap)

In the end this patch is doing just one thing: moving the variable that stores checkpoint_max_size from one class to another.

Line:52, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_config.cc -> I was thinking more along the lines of if somebody changed the order of operations in KVBucket::createNewVBucket() to incr the VBMap state (calls autoConfigure...) before creating the VBucket then we'd leave the size at 0 instead of the size that it's supposed to be an force a cap of 1 item per Checkpoint as a result.

Ahh I see that the default value prior to this change was 0 anyway so it's the same behaviour. I guess with multiple vBuckets it's unlikely to be an issue.

Line:52, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_config.cc -> Just a clarification on that autoConfig() is currently called in VBMap::incr/decr, so the change of ops that you described wouldn't mess with the checkpoint_max_size recomputation 👍
