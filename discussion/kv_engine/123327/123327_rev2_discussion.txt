DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Remove MagmaInfo

MagmaInfo was originally designed to manage stats typically maintained
by the storage engine. But, its maintenance has become troublesome
causing lock inversion errors and race conditions.

The kvstore revision is not persistent and is reset when the storage
engine is shutdown if no vbucket exists so no need to make this
persistent.

docCount will continue to be managed using a RelaxedAtomic vector.

persistedDeletes is not required for magma.
