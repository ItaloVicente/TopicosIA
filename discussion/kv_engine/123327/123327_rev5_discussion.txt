DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Remove MagmaInfo

MagmaInfo was originally designed to manage stats typically maintained
by the storage engine. But, its maintenance has become troublesome
causing lock inversion errors and race conditions.

The kvstore revision is not persistent and is reset when the storage
engine is shutdown if no vbucket exists so no need to make this
persistent.

docCount will be managed using a vector of NonNegativeCounter.

persistedDeletes is not required for magma.
