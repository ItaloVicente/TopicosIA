DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Remove MagmaInfo

MagmaInfo was originally designed to manage stats typically maintained
by the storage engine. But, its maintenance has become troublesome
causing lock inversion errors and race conditions.

The kvstore revision is not persistent and is reset when the storage
engine is shutdown if no vbucket exists so no need to make this
persistent.

docCount will continue to be managed using a RelaxedAtomic vector.

persistedDeletes is not required for magma.

Line:504, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> I think it would be cleaner to have 1 vector with a struct with two members (it doesn't have to be a vector of pointers, just vector<Struct>)

It's fine to keeep the other changes, like passing docCount to encodeVBState, but I see in the .cc the code could be more compact, e.g. a reset function that resets both members. Some paths also access both of these vectors, if the accessed variables are next to each other in memory, cache ahoy!

Line:1076, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> previously this would set kvstoreRev to 1, now you just increment it...

Line:502, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Should comment that these are indexed by vbid

Line:503, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Intentially changed from uint64_t to unint32_t? Was the previous value oversized?

Line:504, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> This used to be, and probably should still be, a non negative counter

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:503, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> This is similar to couchstore's dbFileRevMap. It is not persisted and it corresponds to magma's KVStoreRevision which is a uint32_t.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:504, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> If these were related, that might make sense, but they really are quite different, hence we are keeping the separate. docCount is used in each txn while cachedKVRevision is only used as part of vbucket create.  Looking at couch-kvstore, there are several vectors, even recently added in mad-hatter where the consolidation could have been done but was not for whatever reason. I think it makes more sense to keep these separate.

Also, cachedKVRevision is initialized to 1 at like magma-kvstore.cc 572.
