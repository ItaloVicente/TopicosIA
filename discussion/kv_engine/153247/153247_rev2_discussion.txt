DESCRIPTION:

MB-46216: Update uses of fmtlib to be compatible with v7.0.x

As part of upgrading to a version of fmtlib which supports
compile-time checking of format strings, update kv_engine to build
with fmt v7.0.3:

- Replace deprecated (and removed in 7.0) use of `fmt` macro with
  FMT_STRING macro.

- The type of named arguments has changed from std::string_view to
  const char*.

Note these changes are backwards compatible - code still compiles with
current fmtlib bundled with spdlog (v5.0.1).

Change-Id: I790ccdaed5f5cdb40b89f54e76051861503dfb91
