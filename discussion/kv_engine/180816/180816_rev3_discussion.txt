DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor] Don't inline overridden methods in EWB_Engine

It makes the class pretty horrible to navigate in, and as an
extra bonus we may move should_inject_error down to the rest
in the private section and let the class follow the nice

    public interface
    protected interface
    private

order
