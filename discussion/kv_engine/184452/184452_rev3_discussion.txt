DESCRIPTION:

MB-54975: Update Ephemeral replica memory stats on DEL_VBUCKET

We currently only update the Ephemeral replica memory tracking stats
that are used to determine if we auto delete items when we change the
vBucket state via SET_VBUCKET. We are not updating the stat when we
delete the vBucket via DEL_VBUCKET which is causing us to overcount the
value and stop evicting from active vBuckets sooner than we ought to.
