DESCRIPTION:

MB-37319: Add support for opening historical snapshot - WIP

Try to detect the oldest file header containing the change and
stream that one

@todo - this patch contains untested code trying to squash multiple
headers to avoid iterating over headers outside the pitr granularity

Change-Id: I727e8fc09c0a62a02e38a659855771f6d35133e2
