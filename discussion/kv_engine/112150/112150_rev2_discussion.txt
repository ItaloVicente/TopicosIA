DESCRIPTION:

MB-35133: Test HashTable SV state post-rollback

To verify that all StoredValues in the HashTable are correct
post-rollback, add a dumpStoredValuesAsJson function to HashTable
which we can use to compare the HashTable state before and after
a rollback.

This patch updates all non-durability tests to use this function,
but leaves the durability tests as they are as they are currently
all disabled.
