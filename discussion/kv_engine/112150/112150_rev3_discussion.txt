DESCRIPTION:

MB-35133: Test HashTable SV state post-rollback

To verify that all StoredValues in the HashTable are correct
post-rollback, add a dumpStoredValuesAsJson function to HashTable
which we can use to compare the HashTable state before and after
a rollback.

This patch updates all non-durability tests to use this function,
but leaves the durability tests as they are as they are currently
all disabled.

Note, we actually compare the json strings produced by
nlohmann::json::dump() here as there is a bug in our version of GTest
that causes a stack overflow when attempting to print the
nlohmann::json object. Additionaly, by passing in the 0 parameter,
nlohmann::json::dump() will split our objects with newlines which
GTest can utilise to give us a diff if the string comparison fails.
