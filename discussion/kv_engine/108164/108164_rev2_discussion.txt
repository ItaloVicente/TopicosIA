DESCRIPTION:

MB-32576: Improve dcp disconnect messages

Improve the disconnect log messages for the DCP consumer and producer
to:

1.  Make it clear that the last message refers to all messages and
    not just noops.
2.  Include the DCP noop interval.

Example Producer Disconnect Log Message:

"Disconnecting because a message has not been received for the DCP idle
timeout of 360s. Sent last message (e.g. mutation/noop/streamEnd) 0s
ago. Received last message 361s ago. Last sent noop 0s ago. DCP noop
interval is 1s. opaque: 10000019, pendingRecv: false."

Example Consumer Disconnect Log Message:

Disconnecting because a message has not been received for the DCP idle
timeout of 360s. Received last message (e.g. mutation/noop/StreamEnd)
361s ago. DCP noop interval is 1s.
