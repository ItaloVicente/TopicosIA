DESCRIPTION:

MB-25197: Make setVBucketState use ewouldblock during early warmup

To prevent setVBucketState crashing couch-kvstore (as per MB) when it
tries to access a couchfile revision that doesn't exist, we now block
setVBucketState when warmup hasn't yet populated the VBMap from
persisted state (using EWOULDBLOCK/notifyIOComplete)

No warmup task means setVBucketState can proceed regardless so
ephemeral buckets are unaffected by this change.

The commit adds functionality that saves the setVBucketState caller's
cookie into a Warmup owned list of cookies only if Warmup has not yet
reached the "create-vbucket" stage. Once create-vbucket completes
Warmup will perform notifyIOComplete on all save cookies.
