DESCRIPTION:

MB-32497: Remove potential deadlock with signalIfIdle

Refactor the logic in signalIfIdle to eliminate the potential
deadlock issue where it tries to access the connections underlying
event base if it is called from a context where it already holds
a lock.

signalIfIdle used to update the event mask in libevent to add
a write event to make the socket available. Libevent would then
pick up that socket next time it went down to the OS to do a poll
on the sockets. The problem is that when we try to update the
event mask for a socket libevent will try to acquire the mutex
used by the event base in order to do that. If the code was
called from another worker thread it would hold it's own lock
on the event base (and we're subject for a deadlock).
