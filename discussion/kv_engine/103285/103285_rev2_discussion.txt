DESCRIPTION:

MB-32497: Remove potential deadlock with signalIfIdle

Refactor the logic in signalIfIdle to eliminate the potential
deadlock issue where it tries to access the connections underlying
event base if it is called from a context where it already holds
a lock.

Change-Id: Ic0ba5de83b8f924a8b7457c65d0e91fbf7927f7d

Line:85, daemon/thread.cc -> Is it worth logging?

Line:85, daemon/thread.cc -> My guess is that trying to log it would cause another memory failure formatting the log entry (as it would most likely be bigger)

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> I think it's worth expanding the description here - especially as deadlock bugs can be subtle and hard to follow.

Suggest you include more details of the possible deadlock scenario from the MB, and then also explain how the new notification queue works.
Line:95, daemon/thread.cc -> Do we expect many notifications to be registered in the list for each thread?

If so, then we might need to revisit the performance of this as the linear search could be expensive...

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
Line:95, daemon/thread.cc -> During steady state: no, normally 0-3 entries. (once clients start subscribing to vbucket maps it'll potentially grow bigger)
During bucket deletion: potentially "large" then smaller and smaller..
I'll look into changing this.
