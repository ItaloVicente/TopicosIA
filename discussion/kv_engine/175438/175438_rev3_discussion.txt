File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Should we include the number of front end threads given that we called the stat threads?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hmm.. interesting.. It would be nice to know _why_ ... this is a new stats call so it one wouldn't need to worry about "backwards compatibility" for users as they would need to change their interface anyway...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Think hi's point of view was the the scraping of the data would still be the same so you could just change the what your command line call was and still have the same format. Also if the user want's to get json they can currently call mcstat --json. So outputting json from memcached is likely to break this. I get your point about reducing the number calls down to the wire. But it seems more sensible to me for us to do this for all memcached stats at the same time. So that we don't create some kind of inconstancy between them, and so should be done in this patch.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I spoke to DaveR about the format we should return it in, and he was keen to keep it the same as before, when it was being returned from the ep-engine interface.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Done added as num_worker_threads. Was thinking down the link we would create an alias of num_worker_threads -> threads

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Great. Finally I'm also thinking if we should just return this as a single JSON document rather than a bunch of individual stats.. over the wire this will come with a 24 byte overhead for each of the values.. and a JSON output is just as easy to parse from the user... (like we do for connections and buckets)...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Indeed - this isn't so much "new" functionality as replicating the functionality which we used to have from the `all` stat group showing the number of configured threads via ep_num_auxio_threads etc. Unlike connections and buckets where there's a hierarchal set of data and there's value in using a more structured (yet more complex) datatype like JSON, this is simply 4 numbers.
