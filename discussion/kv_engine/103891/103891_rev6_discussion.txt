DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Stamp Chain into SyncWrite and enable disk-seqno tracking

In general, for supporting the wide set of Durability Requirements we
need to know what node has ack'ed a tracked SyncWrite. For achieving
that, we stamp the chain information into any new tracked SyncWrite.

That allows a more flexible Durability Requirements verification.
In this patch, the new verification is already used for enabling
disk-seqno tracking in the DurabilityMonitor.

Adding the chain-info in SyncWrite is also necessary for adding support
for Multiple-Replicas and Multiple-Replication-Chain, which will be
implemented shortly.
