DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Stamp ReplicationChain into SyncWrite

In general, for supporting the wide set of Durability Requirements we
need to know what node has ack'ed a tracked SyncWrite.
Given that the Requirements could be verified at the receiving of any
seqno-ack (from any node), and given that we will shortly support
multiple replication chains, then we stamp add the chain information to
any new tracked SyncWrite.

Also, with this pacth we start with using the new info in SyncWrite for
implementing a general Durability Requirements verification.
This is necessary now for supporting Level::PersistToMajority, but it is
also a pre-requirement for multiple-replica and
multiple-replication-chain.
