DESCRIPTION:

MB-33773: Don't take a reference to a buffered item

Taking a reference items in the buffer.messages structure is not safe as
a closeStream will clear the messages, making the reference invalid.

To fix the problem no reference is taken, instead we use std::move
and whilst the queue is locked, move the DcpResponse* to the
task's scope, now clearing the queue can't delete the object. Other
changes are made to fit with this move, such as moving back on a
OOM failure.

Testing covers the original fault and exercises a few related code
paths to be try and assert that under these situations we don't end
up with a flowControl leak.
