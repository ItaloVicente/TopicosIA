DESCRIPTION:

MB-45236: Only re-check eviction thresholds if they may have changed

If a StoredValue it not eligible for eviction, it will not be tracked
by the MFU or age histograms. If the histograms have not been changed,
the MFU and age thresholds definitely do not need recalculating.

This reduces time wasted iterating histograms. This would be most
notable in large value eviction buckets where many ineligible (e.g.,
non-resident) items may be visited before `learningPopulation` SVs have
been visited.

Local profiling on Mid-2016 MacBook Pro (8 X 2500 MHz CPU s)
CPU Caches:
  L1 Data 32 KiB (x4)
  L1 Instruction 32 KiB (x4)
  L2 Unified 256 KiB (x4)
  L3 Unified 6144 KiB (x1)

Under set-only workload from pillowfight, recorded for two minutes after first
pager run.

Before:
1.79 min  100.0%	6.00 ms	 	PagingVisitor::visitBucket(std::__1::shared_ptr<VBucket> const&)
1.62 min   90.6%	60.00 ms	 	     ItemEviction::getThresholds(double, double) const

After:
1.75 min  100.0%	40.00 ms	 	PagingVisitor::visitBucket(std::__1::shared_ptr<VBucket> const&)
4.40 s    4.1%	3.00 ms	 	     ItemEviction::getThresholds(double, double) const

A much smaller proportion of the time spent in visitBucket is spent
recalculating thresholds. This difference is repeatable.
The peak rate of evictions/s over this period increased from (roughly)
25k to 35k.

Additionally, while far more indirect, the restore throughput test

tools_restore_400M_rift.test

Improves from ~72 MB/s to ~150 MB/s with this patch.

This perf test is a good representation of a heavy bulk load.
