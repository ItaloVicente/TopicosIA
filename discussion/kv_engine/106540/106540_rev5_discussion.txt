Line:76, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> _local documents don't have the concept of metadata - they just have a key & value. As such you don't need to include MetaData in any written local document.

Also - in general I'd try to construct patches so any new code is used somewhere (even if it's initially just a unit-test) - that ensures the code is "defended" more than just "it compiles". 

Hopefully the reason is obvious - but for the record - if you merge code like this which isn't yet used (even if you know it's correct asa later patch uses it), the code will initially be undefended in the codebase. Given we have ~10 people working on kv-engine at any one time, someone could end up modifying either this code, or some code it depends on and "breaking" it - but that person won't know that because it's not used anywhere.

Line:98, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Can be const.

Line:122, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> I would suggest using an explicit sized encoding of `Vbid`, given this needs to be a stable on-disk format going forward (it's possible the size of the Vbid class changes in future).

Line:128, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Same here.

Line:149, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Style: this can be moved to the initialiser list.

Line:76, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> In magma, local documents need meta data as the underlying interface uses parts of the meta data. It makes the code easier to maintain if we use the same meta data rather than have 2 different meta datas.

Line:98, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done
