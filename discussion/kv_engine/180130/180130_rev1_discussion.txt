Line:1098, daemon/subdocument.cc -> This is an unexplained code change? Is it meant to be removed in this patch?

Line:1098, daemon/subdocument.cc -> No; instead of changing bucket_get_item_info to use a reference I just removed the entire call as we can just call it on the item we've already got (so we don't need the extra error handling).

Line:1098, daemon/subdocument.cc -> I'm not sure I see the value of that... one may always run the git show, git diff or git blame.

Line:1098, daemon/subdocument.cc -> It's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but a line or two mentioning this now might save readers from a little hunt in the future 😊

As it stands, if in 5 years a reader isn't entirely familiar with this code but sees this in a diff while hunting for some bug, they have to find this exact review thread to confirm that this is intentionally in this patch and is genuinely just a refactor with no expected functional impact, with mention in the commit message `git show` is indeed all they'll need.

Line:1098, daemon/subdocument.cc -> It would make commit messages super super super long if we want to write a long essay describing every tiny little change we did in a commit. Personally I start off by reading the code, and if I don't understand the code I would do a git blame and then do the git show for the code. From looking at the diff it would be pretty obvious that it replaced trying to look up the body for the item and write to that. 

I don't think an extra comment in the git commit message that: "oh and the change in subdocument.cc betweeen lines 1086-1097 I no longer call the extra method to fetch the document info given that I already have the document available so I may call the members directly without having to worry about a potential error case"...

Line:1098, daemon/subdocument.cc -> The diff gives "what", the message can give "why", and "how". If the question came up now during review, it's a reasonable prediction that it will come up again for a reader, but they might not have the luxury of just asking you 😜

Right now it's obvious what this change does because we have heaps of context. But what about a new joiner in 2025, who doesn't know why it was done that way before?

In the general case, what if a change brings in a bug, but that poor reader has no context on the "why" from the commit (without finding a review comment)?
It can't hurt to give them a smidge more info so they don't have to ponder whether it was accidentally brought in during a refactor (maybe "woops I git added something from the next patch but it's fine in the end", or "shouldn't make a functional change, but accidentally does because bugs happen").

If it bloats the commit message that badly, some might argue it could go in its own change...



Buutttt, this is a lot of bikeshedding for a small thing - +1 for the change in general but someone else can throw in a deciding vote 👍
