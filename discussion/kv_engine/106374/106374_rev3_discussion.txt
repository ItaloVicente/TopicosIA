DESCRIPTION:

Simplify KVStore persistence callbacks

Simplify KVStore persistence callback handling for set & del
operations. The main motifcation here is to simplify the ownership
model, so once ep-engine calls KVStore::set() or del(), it doesn't
have to handle the ownership of the created callback object. Instead
the underlying store owns the callback object, and can delete it once
it's finished calling it back.

Specifically, for Sync Replication we need to flush an additional
delete() operation when a CommittedSyncWrite is encountered, to remove
any prevous prepared SyncWrite. The current design makes this hard as
we need to insert an extra del into the persistenceCallbacks
container.

Main changes:

1. Modify the types of the IORequest callbacks, from
   raw-pointers-to-Callback-objects to std::function. This allows the
   IORequest to take ownership of the callbacks, but still allows
   different types of callbacks to be held (useful for the unit tests
   which use different types).

2. Use boost::variant instead of a raw union for holding the set &
   delete callback. This mostly removes boilerplate and ensures safety
   (the correct callback type is always accessed).

3. The first two changes remove the need for having a separeate
   persistence callback deque owned by KVStore, and which ep-engine
   must manually populate and clear when necessary.

This currently results in a ~10% _increase_ in directly-measured
per-item memory - in the old structure we needed per queued item:

    KVStore:PersistenceCallbacks
    - 1x ptr + 1x PersistenceCallback per item :   8 B + 32 B  = 40 B
    CouchRequest: 1x object per item                            208 B
                                                                248 Bytes

In the new structure we have removed KVStore::PersistenceCallbacks, but
IORequest (base class for CouchRequest) has increaed due to use of
std::function and boost::variant (various paddding / internal buffers):

    <<KVStore::PersistenceCallbacks removed>>
    CouchRequest:                                               272 B

However, this doesn't include the per-allocation overhead (we now
allocate 1 item instead of 3, and further simplificaiton should be now
possible, so this seems like a sensible trade-off.
