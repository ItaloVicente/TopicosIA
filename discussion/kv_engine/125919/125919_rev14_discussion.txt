DESCRIPTION:

MB-37319: Add support for compaction with PiTR

Use the PiTR configuration when doing compaction by calculating
the starting point in the database by using the following logic:

If granularity is 1 sec, use "now - max age" as the start point

If granularity is less than 1 minute:
   If granularity is 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 then align
   "now - max age" to the closest boundary which make sure that
   that the offset will repeat itself.

   If it isn't any of the above aling the start point to the
   closest minute (it won't wrap nicely if the starting point
   is an odd or even minute.

If the granularity is >= 1 minute we'll drop the second resolution
and perform the same alignment logic as for seconds. If its none
of the numbers mentioned above the start point is aligned to the
top of the hour.
