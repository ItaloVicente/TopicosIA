DESCRIPTION:

GSL: Use not_null<> in server API

Tag non-null pointer args in server_api.h as gsl::not_null<>

GSL provides not_null<T> - this is a wrapper template which can be
applied to pointer types to indicate that pointer should never be
null. Instances of this type have two features:

    1. They cannot directly be assigned nullptr - this is enforced at
    compile-time.

    2. They throw an exception at runtime if they are ever assigned a
       value which happens to be null.

Note with (2), the exception is thrown at the point the variable is
assigned, not when it is later read; as is commonly the case in manual
null checks (for example in the head of a function).

In this patch, annotate all the function arguments in the Server API
which cannot be null with not_null<>. This highlights some
existing errors in unit tests, so fix these.

I'm a bit unsure if this is the "right way" to go here... wouldn't it be better to pass on a reference to an object instead? so that we'd also get type safety?

I think that's probably a good eventual goal; however I wanted to use this approach (for now) for two reasons:

1. To show an example usage of the not_null<> template for people.
2. Because there were a bunch of places I had to fix (which the template was very helpful in finding!) where we assumed the cookie wasn't null, or a null cookie was passed.

We need to fix (2) anyways even if we want to move to passing a reference - we can always make a subsequent change to move over to references - and at that point I'd suggest we move to a C++ style approach of a ServerCookie interface which exposes the cookie methods the engine is allowed to call (i.e. a C++ version of SERVER_COOKIE_API).
