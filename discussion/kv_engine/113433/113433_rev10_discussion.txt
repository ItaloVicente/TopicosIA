DESCRIPTION:

MB-35003: Set fail-over seqno to be the end seqno of previous complete snapshot

This commit changes how the flushVBucket function updates the current
snapshot range for pending/replica vbuckets only. Note the flusher is
shared between active/pending/replica vbuckets and as such these changes
are live for all vbucket states, however active vbuckets always
overwrite the snapshot range with the high flushed seqno.

This description first covers some examples of how the flusher managed
the snapshot range prior to the change.

*Note*: in all of these examples the current/final snapshot is partially
received.

ex1:

Before this commit the flusher very much follows what the checkpoint
manager tells it, e.g. a partially received snapshot {4,8} resulted in
the following disk state:

  vbstate.range = {4,8}
  seqno index = 1,2,3,4,5,6

ex2:

Before this commit multiple checkpoint snapshots could be flushed as a
combined set of items, e.g. receipt of snapshots {1,3} and {4,8}
followed by a flush results in the following disk state:

  vbstate.range = {1,8}
  seqno index = 1,2,3,4,5,6

ex3:

A further important example is from MB-35003 itself, in that when the
producer switches from 'backfill' to 'in-memory' the first in-memory
snapshot is now tagged with the 'checkpoint' flag, this was introduced
in MB-35001.

Before MB-35001 a disk followed by memory snapshot looked as follows,
here we have {1,3, disk} and {4,8, memory}. When a snapshot is received
without the checkpoint flag, the snapshot items just enter the current
checkpoint. Once the flusher is past the {1,3} snapshot, the subsequent
snapshot is just an extension of the current one, tagging snapshots with
the checkpoint flag means a new checkpoint is opened, which can yield a
new outcome.

With MB-35001, the addition of the checkpoint flag means the following
is now a possible outcome of the flusher:

  vbstate.range = {5,8}
  seqno index = 1,2,3,4,5,6

An important outcome of this commit is what happens during replica to
active promotion, and where we set the seqno of the fail-over table
entry. The logic is as follows:

  if (highSeqno == vbstate.range.end) {
    newEntry.seqno = highseqno
  } else {
    newEntry.seqno = vbstate.range.start
  }

With the examples above, promotion to active yields the following new
fail-over entry seqno.

ex1: 4
ex2: 1
ex3: 5

In all of these examples, because of the partial snapshot the fail-over
entry seqo is always the start of a snapshot, and ex3 it's the start of
an artificial checkpoint.

This commit changes the outcome of all of these examples, instead of the
start of the partial snapshot, the fail-over entry seqno will become the
end of the last complete snapshot.

To achieve this the flusher now gets more information about the set of
items it is flushing.

The checkpoint manager is changed so that the flusher receives.

* The entire set of items to flush.
* A vector of snapshot_range_t for individual checkpoint that makes up
  the set of items.

As the flusher iterates through the set of items to flush, the seqno of
each flushed item is compared against the end seqno of each snapshot. If
there is a match, the flusher concludes it has all the items of that
particular snapshot and it can now change the start seqno of the
vbucket's range to be that of the completed snapshot.

Each example from above now changes to have the following outcomes.

ex1:
  vbstate.range = {3,8}
  seqno index = 1,2,3,4,5,6

  fail-over = 3

ex2:
  vbstate.range = {3,8}
  seqno index = 1,2,3,4,5,6

  fail-over = 3

ex3:
  vbstate.range = {3,8}
  seqno index = 1,2,3,4,5,6

  fail-over = 3

A final notable difference that this commit makes is that once the
flusher has absolutely flushed to the very end of the range, the state
now looks as follows.

  vbstate.range = {8,8}
  seqno index = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8

I.e. start = end = high-seqno

There seems to be no advantage to adapting the flusher further to
maintain the prior behaviour, where in an absolutely flushed scenario we
maintain the range.start to reflect some lower value. In all failure and
fail-over scenarios, when the high-seqno matches the range.end, the
range.start is not used.
