DESCRIPTION:

Fix clang warnings related to SingleThreadedRCPtr<>

Fix clang warning now being generated due to an upgrade form
scan-build-6.0 to scan-build-9. The warnings fixed in this patch are all
related to SingleThreadedRCPtr<>. To fix these warnings we need to add
asserts to the SingleThreadedRCPtr<> template to tell clang analyzer
the valid situations branches can be taken. Also in some cases we need
to use std::move() rather than a copy of SingleThreadedRCPtr<> to
convince clang analyzer that the underlying object will remain
referenced and will not be freed after it as already been.

We also ensure in this patch that we correctly handle self assignment
when using the move operator.

A number of the changes in this patch are unnecessary, seems like this is a good exploration of the problem and how to fix, but there's various changes in here which haven't been thought through well - the best example being the `assert(value == value)` tautology.

Please ensure we have a minimal, clean set of changes to address this problem.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Clang analyser

Line:292, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> Pretty sure this is redundant - to reach this code path value must already not be a null pointer.

Line:298, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> Similary here, you don't need this as analyser already knows the value is nullptr given line 297.

Line:322, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> This is pointless in it's current location, given you've just checked that value != nullptr at line 321.

Suggest you move the assert to the start of the function - value should always be non-null if this function is called.

Then I think you can revert the rest of the changes in this function.

Line:350, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> See https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rc-copy-self - given this could be a hot function (we change ref-counts all over the place) probably better to avoid the conditional.

Line:367, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> It's fine for the Pointer type to be null here, it's just not safe to dereference it.

Line:394, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> As above, we should actually ensure that self-swap is possible.

Line:398, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> You've already checked this at line 394, shouldn't be necessary to do again.

Line:401, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> redundant

Line:402, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> Totally redundant - a tautology!

Line:173, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> This _should_ be a move IMHO, it avoids an unnecessary incr/decr of the ref-count (outstanding prepares could in theory be large during warmup so we don't really want to slow this down).

Line:1327, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Ditto, we should be able to use move here.

Line:133, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> These should be non-references - see https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-sharedptrparam-owner

Line:156, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> Ditto
