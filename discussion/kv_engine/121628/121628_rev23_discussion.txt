DESCRIPTION:

Fix Clang Static Analyzer warnings related to SingleThreadedRCPtr<>

Fix clang warning now being generated due to an upgrade form
scan-build-6.0 to scan-build-9. The warnings fixed in this patch are all
related to SingleThreadedRCPtr<>. To fix these warnings we need to add
asserts to the SingleThreadedRCPtr<> template to tell clang analyzer
the valid situations branches can be taken. Also in some cases we need
to use std::move() rather than a copy of SingleThreadedRCPtr<> to
convince clang analyzer that the underlying object will remain
referenced and will not be freed after it as already been.

We also ensure in this patch that we correctly handle self assignment
when using the move operator.
