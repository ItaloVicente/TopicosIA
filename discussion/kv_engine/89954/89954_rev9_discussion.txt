DESCRIPTION:

MB-27661 [6/n]: Fix MSVC warnings - C4477, C4805, C4305

This patch addresses the following generated warnings:

C4477 - ‘<function>’ : format string ‘<format-string>’ requires an
        argument of type ‘<type>’, but variadic argument <position>
        has type ‘<type>’
C4805 - operation' : unsafe mix of type 'type' and type 'type' in
	operation. This warning is generated for comparison operations
	between bool and int.
C4305 - identifier' : truncation from 'type1' to 'type2'. The identifier
	is converted to a smaller type, resulting in loss of information.
