DESCRIPTION:

MB-27661 [6/n]: Fix MSVC warnings - C4800, C4477, C4805

This patch addresses the following generated warnings:

C4800 - type' : forcing value to bool 'true' or 'false'
        (performance warning)
C4477 - ‘<function>’ : format string ‘<format-string>’ requires an
        argument of type ‘<type>’, but variadic argument <position>
        has type ‘<type>’
C4805 - operation' : unsafe mix of type 'type' and type 'type' in
	operation. This warning is generated for comparison operations
	between bool and int.

Change-Id: Ib21781eee1f7124da890f2ee7ad900b368a503c2

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> For this one I suggest we just ignore it - Microsoft have removed it in VS2017 - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-3-c4800

Line:258, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> This looks incorrect - should be equals.

Line:124, daemon/subdocument.cc -> Suggest updating these ones to the same style Trond suggested.

Line:744, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> I don't think you are narrowing here - it's widening from bool to uint8_t. Suggest changing to something like:

return uint8_t(bits.test(nruIndex1)) | (uint8_t(bits.test(nruIndex2)) << 1);

Line:129, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_checkpoint.cc -> IIRC MSVC doesn't support %z for size_t (it's a linux / unix extension).

Given `j`only has range 0..497; just use `int` - or std::to_string() which is a more "C++ style" way of doing this.
