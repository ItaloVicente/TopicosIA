DESCRIPTION:

Add support for bumping soft limit for core files

Breakpad will create a minidump of the process when it chrash,
but it has a few problems / limitations:

* The process is still running while the minidump is written
  so other threads may cause other problems

* The minidump is limited in its content (by design) and
  may not contain the information you're looking for.

This patch adds a new variable `create_full_core_dumps` in
daemon/memcached.cc which is set to false by default. When
set to true breakpad will _NOT_ be initialized, but instead
we'll try to bump the soft corefile soft limit and set the
working directory to <root>/var/lib/couchbase/crash
