DESCRIPTION:

Add support for bumping soft limit for core files

Breakpad will create a minidump of the process when it chrash,
but it has a few problems / limitations:

* The process is still running while the minidump is written
  so other threads may cause other problems

* The minidump is limited in its content (by design) and
  may not contain the information you're looking for.

This patch adds a new variable `create_full_core_dumps` in
daemon/memcached.cc which is set to false by default. When
set to true breakpad will _NOT_ be initialized, but instead
we'll try to bump the soft corefile soft limit and set the
working directory to <root>/var/lib/couchbase/crash

We'd need to configure all of them to make sure that the core files ends up in a well known location (and that jenkins has write permissions there).

I'm not sure if its desirable to always create full core dumps on all of our perf machines (and make sure that we prune them so that we don't run out of space)... I don't have the knowledge or access to all of the builders to make sure that they're properly configured.
