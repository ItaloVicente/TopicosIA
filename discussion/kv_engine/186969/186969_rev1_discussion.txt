DESCRIPTION:

[BP] MB-55600, MB-51117: Set the OSO range to only include the requested collection

Prior to this patch the range for say collection:8 was set as:

start="8"
end="9"

The kvstore by-id scan uses an inclusive range, so would of returned
a key that exactly matches the end.

The correct range is:

start="8"
end="8\xFF"

which matches only keys from collection:8

Note: This is linked to the following backport in couchstore

https://review.couchbase.org/c/couchstore/+/186964

Both are required to 1) for the new code in MB-55600 and to keep
all CV test passing (couchstore backport triggered a failure).
