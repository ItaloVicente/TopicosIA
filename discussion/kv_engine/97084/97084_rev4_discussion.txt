DESCRIPTION:

MB-30532: Add unit tests for PassiveStream::handleSnapshotEnd

I add tests to check that the following applies.

When a Consumer receives the snapshotEnd mutation, we expect that:

1) for disk-snapshot && vbHighSeqno=0, the open checkpoint-id is just
updated from 0 to 1 (0 is reserved for the backfill phase)

2) for memory-snapshots (which include also disk-snaphot &&
vbHighSeqno>0) and *only when mem_used>high_wat*, the open checkpoint
is closed and new one is created with id=prevId+1

Change-Id: I8c623f76147159f8f9426b6c1fe9e88e0dac3274
