DESCRIPTION:

MB-47811: Magma - Flush collection stats doc after meta update

As part of the collections meta update we may delete the "alive"
stats doc if we drop a collection in that flush batch. If we drop
and recreate a collection in the same flush batch though then we
are currently deleting the "alive" doc without recreating it for
the new version of the collection.

Re-order the flushing code to update the metadata (and potentially
delete the stats doc) before we flush the new version to ensure that
it makes it to disk.
