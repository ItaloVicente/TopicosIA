DESCRIPTION:

MB-47308: Invoke MagmaKVStore callbacks in Primary domain

A number of Magma APIs which take callbacks need to wrap the callback
in 'primary' domain.

These changes were made in the original change here:

    http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/157582/

But were lost in a rebase when a commit without these changes was
uploaded to review.
