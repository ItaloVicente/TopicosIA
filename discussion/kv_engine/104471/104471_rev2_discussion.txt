DESCRIPTION:

MB-32341: Couchstore-Trace operations on a file

-Tracing support to couchstore and dump trace on detection of corruption
-mprotect of iobuffer (optionally with an env variable)
-verify write to buffer cache by reading back

To compile a kvengine test, need to modify the CMakeLists.txt.

Dynamically turn on tracing with cbepctl (1 for tracing and 2 for tracing and verification)

Line:55, daemon/breakpad_linux.cc -> This is a security hole - we don't want to run hardcoded paths outside our own installation. Please remove it.

Line:318, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> This looks incorrect - ep-engine targets shouldn't be including arbitrary couchstore source files.

Why do you need this source file - I don't see why it should be exposed to the fs_stats test?

Line:838, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Name is too generic - it should mention couchstore / disk backend. I also think "verification" is a bit generic, given this enabled both tracing (nothing to do with verifying things) and multiple verification levels.

How about something like "couchstore_paranoid_checks" ?

Line:840, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Similar here, description should mention couchstore

Line:841, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Suggest you use the `enum` type which allows you to give explicit, self-documenting names instead of the opaque (0, 1, 2)

Line:55, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.h -> Again, I think you want a more specific name here.

Line:803, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> I don't believe you need this change - the couchstore verification/paranoia level should be contained within Configuration (at the ep-engine level), and then passed into KVStoreConfig for the backend.

Line:938, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> ditto

Line:605, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> As previous comment, shouldn't be needed.

Line:642, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> As previous comment, shouldn't be needed.

Note if you use the same ChangeId in the commit message as the associated couchstore patch then commit-validation will check out both patches at the same time to allow you to test them.

Line:55, daemon/breakpad_linux.cc -> I want the trace to be not lost. This will stop tracing and dump it. I could not think of a better way to guarantee it than to trigger a script.
Is there a better way to accomplish this?

For example the script I use is

MCCTL_PATH="/Users/srinath.duvuru/couchbase/install/bin"
COUCHSTORE_TRACE_DUMP_PATH="/couchstore_verification/couchstore_trace_dump.json"
$MCCTL_PATH/mcctl -h localhost:12000  -u Administrator -P password set trace.stop
while true; do
    uuid=$($MCCTL_PATH/mcctl -h localhost:12000  -u Administrator -P password get trace.dump.begin)

    if [[ $uuid =~ ^\{?[A-F0-9a-f]{8}-[A-F0-9a-f]{4}-[A-F0-9a-f]{4}-[A-F0-9a-f]{4}-[A-F0-9a-f]{12}\}?$ ]]; then
       $MCCTL_PATH/mcctl -h localhost:12000 -u Administrator -P password get trace.dump.chunk?id=$uuid >> $COUCHSTORE_TRACE_DUMP_PATH
    else
         exit 0
    fi
done

Line:318, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> os.cc is getting used here and a CRC check was added in os.cc. So, the build fails without the os.cc added.
