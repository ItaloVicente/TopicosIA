DESCRIPTION:

MB-36971: Never skip op::checkpoint_start in CM::getItemsForCursor

In MB-35245 we have introduced a bug where we may skip checkpoint_start
items in CheckpointManager::getItemsForCursor().
The side effect is that the MARKER_FLAG_CHK may not be set when sending
a SnapshotMarker to Replica. That may cause a Replica "merging"
snapshots of different types (Disk/Memory) into the same open
checkpoint.
