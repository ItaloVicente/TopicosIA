DESCRIPTION:

MB-37046: Never skip op::checkpoint_start in CM::getItemsForCursor

In MB-35245 we have introduced a bug where we may skip checkpoint_start
items in CheckpointManager::getItemsForCursor().
The side effect is that the MARKER_FLAG_CHK may not be set when sending
a SnapshotMarker to Replica. That may cause a Replica "merging"
snapshots of different types (Disk/Memory) into the same open
checkpoint.

Line:897, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> This solution feels backwards - and fragile. You've moved the cursor too far (via incrCursor); then you move it back to where it _should_ have stopped.

Can we address this in a way where we don't have to "undo" what we just did - i.e. don't move the cursor too far in the first place?

Line:1183, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> This seems incorrect (and possibly a performance regression).

It's perfectly correct for the checkpoints of the same type to be merged- it just means you need all of it to be consistent.

If there's a functional reason why snapshots of the same type cannot be merged then please document it here. 

I don't want to potentially perturb performance of KV-Engine at this late stage in the release - there could be workloads which suffer if we don't merge the snapshots into a single checkpoint.

If we want to pursue this change I suggest we look at it for 6.5.1.

Line:133, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.h -> are these changes necessary? Looks like you always call with same parameters

Line:1183, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Actually my statement is misleading as it suggests that here I'm doing something new.
But, this change just reverts the behaviour here to what we always used to do before the last change (ie, setting this flag by processing checkpoint_start items in ActiveStream::processItems() ).

The last change (on the left) aimed to workaround the missing checkpoint_start item for when we transition from CheckpointDisk to CheckpointMemory.
But, it missed to address the same issue for when we transition from CheckpointMemory to CheckpointDisk.

This fix (not skipping any checkpoint_start in CM::getItemsForCursor) addresses both transitions, and we don't need the extra code here.

Line:133, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.h -> If I use the same {snapStart, snapEnd} in all tests then it is just random.
I definitely use the clearCM=false flag in some cases where I don't want to start from a clear CM

Line:897, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> We can surely add a new stl-like 'getNext(cursor)' that doesn't move the cursor, and check that

Line:1183, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Could you clarify what you mean by "we used to do"?

Suggest writing the comment in terms of exactly when and why we should set the flag; history isn't really a suitable thing to list in comments (save commit messages for that!)
