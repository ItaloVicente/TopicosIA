DESCRIPTION:

MB-36971: Never skip op::checkpoint_start in CM::getItemsForCursor

In MB-35245 we have introduced a bug where we may skip checkpoint_start
items in CheckpointManager::getItemsForCursor().
The side effect is that the MARKER_FLAG_CHK may not be set when sending
a SnapshotMarker to Replica. That may cause a Replica "merging"
snapshots of different types (Disk/Memory) into the same open
checkpoint.

> maybe not a great idea but given the ckpt mgr code is looking pretty complicated with these changes we could instead do something "simple" like always send CHK flag when sending DISK snaps

That is another possibility and think that we all agree that we should refactor the entire CM::getItemsForCursor -> AS::processItems -> AS::snapshot path.

Honestly I think that the main point here is: why should we ever skip a checkpoint_start item?
That is unexpected, the code in ActiveStream expects to set flags into SnapshotMarker driven by the presence of checkpoint_start items in what is returned from CM::getItemsForCursor.
Then sure, we can workaround the missing ckpt_start by "always send CHK flag when sending DISK snaps" and even other corner-cases if any. But it feels like not solving the underlying issue (at least to me).

I think at this stage we want a fix which is as small, straightforward, and consistent as possible. I think that you have is pretty much it, however I acknowledge the other comments:

- Ben: I agree we could probably get the same end-result in forcing the CHK flag (and with less code), but that feels non-obvious and likely more confusing down the line.
- Paolo: Yes, the current implementation is a bit over-complex / non-standard compared to STL, but 6.5.0 isn't the time to change that now :)

LGTM. Would also like Ben to review before merging.
