DESCRIPTION:

MB-36971: Never skip op::checkpoint_start in CM::getItemsForCursor

In MB-35245 we have introduced a bug where we may skip checkpoint_start
items in CheckpointManager::getItemsForCursor().
The side effect is that the MARKER_FLAG_CHK may not be set when sending
a SnapshotMarker to Replica. That may cause a Replica "merging"
snapshots of different types (Disk/Memory) into the same open
checkpoint.

Line:932, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Mmm checking out this, it moves the cursor to the *dummy* item in the next checkpoint, which maybe even better than what I did above as it allow the CheckpointRemover to do its job

Line:882, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Nit: I know this is logically the same as before, but please try to keep patches to the minimum scope at this stage in the release - aids in reviewing and minimises any chance of introducing regression.

Line:919, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> This actually might be over-complicated, given CheckpointCursor objects are relatively heavyweight to copy / create temporary objects.

There's probably a big cleanup we could do here to make CheckpointCursor more like an STL iterator, but for this stage in 6.5.0 I think it's simpler to just have

Line:425, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> This should probably be const given it doesn't change the input.

Line:425, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Use of the optional isn't clear here - is that to indicate we've reached the end of the CheckpointList? If so, why not use end()?

Probably more idiomatic to create `next()` method on CheckpointCursor which returns a new CheckpointCursor object.

Line:882, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Done

Line:425, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> The reason behind optional is that I'm using a similar semantic to CM::incrCursor and CM::moveCursorToNextCheckpoint, which return true if they manage to advance the cursor, false otherwise.

Note the usage of this function.
It is used in CM::getItemsForCursor to understand if we are entering a new checkpoint in CM::checkpointList, we already know that we are at the end of the current-checkpoint:

http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/118409/7/engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc@901

That's why this is a CheckpointManager function.

maybe not a great idea but given the ckpt mgr code is looking pretty complicated with these changes we could instead do something "simple" like always send CHK flag when sending DISK snaps
