DESCRIPTION:

MB-36971: Send the HCS when streaming a Disk-Checkpoint

For Durability we need to keep track of the original source of a
Checkpoint, Disk/Memory. The reason is that, because of on-disk
deduplication and topology changes, a Producer we may end up with
streaming a disk-snapshot from memory. See MB-35245 for details.

We already send the HCS in the SnapshotMarker for disk-snapshot from
disk (done in MB-34017). We need to do the same for disk-snapshot from
memory.

By missing that we could end up with a newly promoted Active
re-committing already-committed Prepares and Replicas failing with
"Prepare not found in the HashTable" (legal at Replica, given that the
Prepare has been already committed and removed from the HT). See
MB-36971 for details.

code looks fine to me, would prefer if this was split in two and the test split into two though. I also dislike the solution, but feels like the easiest one at the moment
Line:67, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> this swap/rename/amalgamation of code should ideally be a separate patch to make review simpler

Line:3639, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Most of the new test code here is to test that the memory snapshot does not send the HCS correct? I think that would be better split into a different test case as this has grown very long. It also doesn't need to start out as replica to be in that state.

Line:67, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> I think the same, doing

Line:3639, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> This test covers 2 snapshot transitions (Memory->Disk->Memory), agreed on splitting and testing 1 transition in each.


> It also doesn't need to start out as replica

Actually it does, that /should/ be the only way an Active ends up with streaming a disk-snapshot from memory.
What could be another case?


But, even if I'm wrong, that is the original test scenario for the issue that we are fixing in this patch (details in MB).

Line:3639, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> I mean we should start out as replica for the disk snapshot test, for the memory snapshot test there is no need to start out as replica so that test could be a lot simpler (probably just added on to an existing one)

Line:1121, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Checking this, a stricter GT condition should apply here.
