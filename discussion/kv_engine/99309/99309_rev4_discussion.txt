DESCRIPTION:

MB-30552: Convert type of vBucket id's from uint16_t to Vbid [1/n]

(Stage 1 of n) This commit aims to change the usage type of vBucket
id's to the new type 'Vbid' within the inner workings of each
function. This allows greater control over what operations can be
performed on a vBucket id, as well as ensuring the output formatting
is consistent. To support the splitting of this into multiple stages,
Vbid can currently be implicitly converted back to uint16_t to
cover elements that have not yet been converted.

This commit has been cherry-picked and then reverted, due to build
errors. It's previous changeID was
 I0454882561e4fb7a91f5405f59e9489a5cfe92f1

Change-Id: I4a507179dd08cb8909e71aabd3ed19a40938a650

Line:27, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> Try including <platform/sopcket.h>

Line:29, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> Why do you need this?

Line:80, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> Shouldn't need this (a uint_16t doesn't have this method) - doesn't the template class version suffice?

Line:84, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> Suggest you drop the `vbid` suffix - that's implicit in the class name.

Line:118, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> As previous comments, shouldn't Vbid objects generally be immutable.

Line:29, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> If there's no use of unordered_map in this file, then there's no need to #include it's header file?

(aka: please don't randomly add / remove code thinking it might fix a problem - understand why something is needed)!

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:29, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> This was added in response to breaking the master branch. The error pointed towards problems with hash but I've yet to be able to reproduce the original building errors so can't guarantee it fixes it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:118, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> Yes. This is already scoped for removal but at this stage elements not included in this patch use vb in a for loop, so these are included to support that in the meantime. I'll add a comment to clarify this.
