DESCRIPTION:

MB-30865: [6/n] Store keys in memory and disk with leb128 prefix

With this commit, all keys are now stored in memory with
a leb128 prefix (collection-ID), and for persistent buckets on
disk too.

This applies to memcache and couchbase buckets.

Line:25, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.cc -> If we go via const_char_buffer can we simplify/remove some of the casts here?

Line:35, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> I think this needs updating now?

Line:103, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> From the callers of this it wasn't totally obviously exactly what "non-encoded" meant. Perhaps rename to something more explicit - maybe getWithoutCollectionId or similar?

Line:121, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> Given "c_str" is normally (for std::string) the complete thing null-terminated; I think it should also null-terminate the result - or if you don't want to do that (given it's test-only) maybe have it return a std::string and rename to something more explicit?

Line:227, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> Given I think you need to read the LEB128 encoded data to determine the position of the string part of the key, might be simpler to just do something like the previous implementation.

Also, do we need to consider canonical LEB128 encoding - i.e. what if the CollectionID (e.g. '100') was encoded in 1B in the LHS, but 2B in the RHS?

Line:301, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> As above, might be worth performing a canonical encode so we ensure (for performance and correctness) that LEB128 always uses the shortest possible encoding?

Line:59, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hash_table_test.cc -> Little unfortunate this has got so complex to compare "keys". Given that std::string (or cnst_char_buffer)  should do the right thing (ignores embedded nulls), could we not still use EXPECT_EQUAL assuming we can get both lhs and rhs as that string/const_char_buffer?

If not, even a helper method somewhere (overloaded operator== or `compare`) would be nicer for test readers/writers to use.

Line:132, include/memcached/dockey.h -> If we store this anywhere probably worth defining as a char or similar 1B type.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:25, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.cc -> It is swings and roundabouts, removes the casts here, but adds a load more in other places (I did have a try, but it started creeping)

Line:301, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> That would mean decoding all incoming collection-IDs and re-encoding?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:59, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hash_table_test.cc -> This wasn't comparing keys though, it was storing the key in the body and then comparing the key against the body in the expect_true, and was using StoredDocKey data in the set (so includes leb128). Changing the code so it uses to_string and simplifies the compare
