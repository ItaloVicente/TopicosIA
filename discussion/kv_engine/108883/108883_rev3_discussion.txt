DESCRIPTION:

Let engine_testapp depend on all modules being tested

The motivation behind the change is to ease the debugging / editing
cycle in an IDE where you set engine_testapp as the binary and provide
the right command line argument to run the test you'd like to debug.
With this change we'll rebuild the object file with the test if
you modified any of the code within the test before pressing run/debug
in the IDE.
