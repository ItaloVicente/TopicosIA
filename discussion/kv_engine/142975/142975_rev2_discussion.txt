DESCRIPTION:

MB-43055: [BP] Ensure ItemPager available is not left set to false

Backport of ac69da7845 http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/141367

The ItemPager exited early, without scheduling a PagingVisitor, if
current memory usage had already dropped below the low watermark by the
time the ItemPager task was run.

However, this was done _after_ the `available` flag had been set to
false. This was an issue, as the flag is only set back to true by
`PagingVisitor::complete()` - but no PagingVisitor was scheduled.

Fix by exiting before `available` is altered.
