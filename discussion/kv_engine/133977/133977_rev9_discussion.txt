DESCRIPTION:

MB-32358: Reduce the need for rollback for collection streams

Reduce the need of rollback for collection streams that are lagging
behind the vbucket high seqno. To do this add logic to the our rollback
code to ensure we don't force the client to rollback if they have seen
all mutations/events for the collections that they are streaming even if
the vbucket purge seqno is higher than the requested seqno e.i.
(client.start.seqno < vb.purge.seqno AND client.start >= collection.high
AND collection.high <= vb.purge). We also perform this check for a
second time between the point of which we decided if we're performing
rollback and if not when we then double check before performing
backfill in case the purge seqno has advanced between the stream request
being excepted and backfill starting.

Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

Line:96, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> If scanCtx was null we would previously log in the block line 125 onwards and clearly log that the scanCtx couldn't be created (line 141)

This change now loses that enhanced logging, we will log this new message but never know the reason, was a scanCtx issue or a failure to read from kvstore.

I would look at combining this new if (!collHIghSucess) into the set of failures being checked in the block starting on line 125

Line:235, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> I think we should name-match the DcpProducer function you added so we keep the full "Collection" name and call this getHighSeqnoOfCollections, i think it's fine to exclude FromDisk as the class ownership suggests just that

Line:236, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> should be a const reference so we know this function doesn't modify the unique_ptr

Line:2078, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> if we use logger->warn we should get a more detailed prefix

Line:96, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> I've split scanCtx into its own log line and check as it makes it clear to read.
