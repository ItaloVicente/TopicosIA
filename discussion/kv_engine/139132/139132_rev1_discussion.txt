DESCRIPTION:

MB-42329: Updated revid macro's type to be congruent with the xattr.

The vattr returns revid as a string, but the macro was writing the value
numerically instead.  This fixes the newly introduced macro to be
the same type as the virtual attribute.

Could you expand the testcase for these (http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/134715/6/tests/testapp/testapp_xattr.cc#1855) to check the format of revid please?
