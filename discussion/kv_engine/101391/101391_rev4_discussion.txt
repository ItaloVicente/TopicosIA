DESCRIPTION:

MB-31863: Fix toJson to return correct set of collections for the scope

Manifest::toJson was returning the same collections for every scope,
leading to strange output from get_collections (visible via use of
cbepctl). The toJson unit test wasn't testing for input using
a non-default scope - now updated.

Line:472, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/manifest_test.cc -> We should test UID instead of name as name isn't necessarily unique. Should also add a test input with non-unique names in the same scope

Line:472, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/manifest_test.cc -> done - the test 'abc4' uses vegetable and vegetable in different scopes, is that what you mean?

Line:472, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/manifest_test.cc -> That wouldn't be a valid Manifest, within a scope we have unique collection names, and within the manifest unique scope names.

I will add validating scope names

Also needed would be max_ttl when that is merged

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:472, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/manifest_test.cc -> I meant that we should have two vegetable collections (same name, different uid) in the same scope. It probably doesn't add much value now that we test the UID instead, but I thought at first that such a test case would have highlighted the issue with the test.

I realised that it wouldn't have helped though because we also need to check that everything existing in the manifest also exists in the output, as well as the current check that everything in the output exists in the manifest. Should also do the same thing for scopes.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:472, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/manifest_test.cc -> Ahh okay, currently the code in manifest.cc allows such a manifest with the same scope names or the same collection names within a scope. I was under the impression that only the uid's has to be unique. The design doc also only stipulates that CID is unique https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X-v8GWQjplrMMaYwwWOzEuP4AUoDNIAvS39NmEjQ3_E/edit#heading=h.no14rlvgkgrr.

I wrote a couple test cases to double check the code so can make a quick patch making scope names unique and collection names unique within a scope if you like
