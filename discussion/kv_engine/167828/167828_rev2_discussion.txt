DESCRIPTION:

PagingVisitor doesn't attempt to remove checkpoints

The ItemPager still has a legacy call for attempting checkpoint removal
before proceeding with item ejection.

That is not longer needed in Neo:
 - Checkpoints are detached from the CM and moved to the Destroyer as
   soon as they become eligible for removal, so the Pager isn't
   expected to find anything to remove. That is the new Eager
   checkpoint removal approach in Neo;
 - The call isn't supposed to be necessary even in the case where the
   legacy CheckpointRemoval::Lazy mode is enabled and a checkpoint
   removal perf degradation is spotted, as in Neo we can enable
   multiple checkpoint remover tasks to fix that.
   See the checkpoint_remover_task_count in EP configuration for
   reference.
