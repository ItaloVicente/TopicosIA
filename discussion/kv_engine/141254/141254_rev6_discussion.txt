DESCRIPTION:

Change interface diff logic.

In ns_server, there was a refactor to make interfaces address family
specific, see, http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/140669.
Example is as below.

A change is required in the interface diff logic of kv, to identify
address family mismatch after the above refactor. The diff logic prior
to this change would drop an IPv4 interface whose host is <<"*">> and
port is 12000, even though the new wanted interfaces where as per [2]
requiring IPv4. The problem is that the current logic would decide to
drop the IPv4 interface after comparing with the 1st optional interface
which is IPv6.

Example of refactor in interfaces:
[1] Before:
[
 {
    "port": 12000,
    "host": "*",
    "ipv4": "required",
    "ipv6": "optional"
 }
]

[2] After:
[
 {
    "port": 12000,
    "host": "*",
    "ipv4": "off",
    "ipv6": "optional"
 },
 {
    "port": 12000,
    "host": "*",
    "ipv4": "required",
    "ipv6": "off"
 }
]

Thanks for the clarification, I have made changes to the tests and the commit message to better describe the problem that I'm trying to solve.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> I've filed MB-43129 for this. 

Please reword the subject to "MB-43129: Allow interface reconfig of multiple entries with same host and port"

(or something like that).

The fact that ns_server is doing refactor isn't intersting in the context of this patch as this is was a limitation/bug of the current reconfigure logic.

Line:148, tests/testapp/testapp_interfaces.cc -> Nit: Its easier to see the test failure if you split this into two ASSERT_TRUE to see which one we're missing (or add << "IPv4: " << ipv4 << " IPv6: " << ipv6;

as it stands all you'll see that the test fail without any indication if it is both of them or which one is missing.
