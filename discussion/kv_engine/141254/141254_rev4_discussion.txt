Patch Set 4: Code-Review-1

Hi. I feel I'm missing a piece of information here.

1) Whats the motivation behind these changes? Which problems are we
   trying to solve, and wouldn't it have been better to spend the time
   implementing MB-39620 instead?

2) Now that you specify all of the interfaces explicitly, can't we
   just kill the entire "optional" logic? memcached added support for
   binding to IPv4 and IPv6 before we started the company and would "by
   default" bind to all both IPv4 and IPv6 if it could find it. As part
   of adding support for IPv6 in our product the parameters was added;
   initially as a boolean variable. The problem was that ns_server would
   set it to true even if there wasn't an IPv6 stack on the machine;
   causing memcached to refuse to start as it couldn't bind to the IPv6
   address. From what I can see ns-server isn't using the port number
   file feature so with an "optional" interface you have no idea if
   the interface exist or not (read: it could only be used for IPv6
   if the cluster was configured for IPv4 and IPv4 if the cluster was
   set up for IPv6 to make it easier for clients who use the naming
   service with AF_UNSPEC instead of AF_INET[6] to look up the host
   (the mc* programs installed on the server will use AF_UNSPEC by
   default unless --ipv6/--ipv4 is provided on the command line.
   most users don't know/care what the system is configured to use.
   They expect the naming service on the system to do this for them
   and this is where I think our IPv4/6 support is doing it the wrong
   way.. We should just use whatever the operating system provides
   (dualstack, only one of them etc) and it'll just work out of the box
   for people (and not just bind to the IPv6 interface and leave the IPv4
   interface hanging there... and then the user who tried to connect to
   "mynode" would "fail" if the naming service resolves it to IPv4 before
   IPv6 and they don't explicitly tell it to use IPv6 (or tries all
   address families in their connect).

For MB-42372 EnforceSSL feature we need to move all the non-ssl interfaces to use loopback in case of IPv4 that's 127.0.0.1 and ::1 for IPv6 interfaces. It makes little sense to change the "host" to be "127.0.0.1" and "ipv6" as "optional". Hence, I'm separating out the interfaces based on 
address family.

This change is simpler and non-disruptive while MB-39620 needs additional work and may not fit into cheshire-cat timeline.

This seems like a bigger conversation, and perhaps should be discussed with a wider audience.
Also, removing/keeping the "optional" logic isn't related to this change(and could have been done prior to this change as well), as such I feel we shouldn't be discussing it here. I have filed MB-43084 so that ns_server can look into it.

Wouldn't you get the exact same behavior by changing "*" to "localhost" instead of expanding the list to explicit entries for IPv4/6?

We don't use "localhost" as it's just a convention that that string is mapped to the loopback address on all available address families in etc/hosts. We always use the explicit address-family specific name for the loopback.

So why don't you use loopback in this context as it gives you what you want and would be simpler?

Also:

If you want this logic you're describing you should be able to do the following.

1. Start with the following config:

[
  {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "ipv4": "optional",
    "ipv6": "off",
    "port": 11210
  },
  {
    "host": "::1",
    "ipv4": "off",
    "ipv6": "optional",
    "port": 11210
  },
  {
    "host": "*",
    "ipv4": "optional",
    "ipv6": "optional",
    "port": 11210
  }
]

That will give you the following port definitions in memcached:
{
  "ports": [
    {
      "family": "AF_INET",
      "name": "127.0.0.1:11210",
      "port": 11210,
      "ssl": false,
      "system": false,
      "tag": ""
    },
    {
      "family": "AF_INET6",
      "name": "[::1]:11210",
      "port": 11210,
      "ssl": false,
      "system": false,
      "tag": ""
    },
    {
      "family": "AF_INET",
      "name": "0.0.0.0:11210",
      "port": 11210,
      "ssl": false,
      "system": false,
      "tag": ""
    },
    {
      "family": "AF_INET6",
      "name": "[::]:11210",
      "port": 11210,
      "ssl": false,
      "system": false,
      "tag": ""
    }
  ]
}

2. When you want to shut down the local interface you drop the entry for the "all interfaces":
[
  {
    "host": "127.0.0.1",
    "ipv4": "optional",
    "ipv6": "off",
    "port": 11210
  },
  {
    "host": "::1",
    "ipv4": "off",
    "ipv6": "optional",
    "port": 11210
  }
]

Now memcached will use the following ports:
{
  "ports": [
    {
      "family": "AF_INET",
      "name": "127.0.0.1:11210",
      "port": 11210,
      "ssl": false,
      "system": false,
      "tag": ""
    },
    {
      "family": "AF_INET6",
      "name": "[::1]:11210",
      "port": 11210,
      "ssl": false,
      "system": false,
      "tag": ""
    }
  ]
}

3. If you want to enable all hosts again you can just add back the entry with "*".

This works with the current code without any modifications...

As Dave said earlier, we like to be explicit in using loopback address(127.0.0.1 for ipv4 and ::1 for ipv6) as we don't want to go through address resolution logic of the underlying platform.

There are additional changes that is required for MB-41189, and what you are suggesting will make things uglier from the point of view of ns_server logic. Also, I don't think I'm adding complexity on the kv side as well. Overall I feel this is a cleaner way of approaching the problem described earlier. Could you tell me where you see problems with this approach? and why you are suggesting alternatives?

What's "cleaner" or not is probably subject for personal opinion and from which component you look at it. The reason for suggesting alternatives as you call it is that what you're requesting is already possible with the current API, and the commit message fails to tell me what's broken. Instead you've referened to two bug reports which clearly may be solved by the current API without any changes (from the previous examples). 

The unit test you added also pass without your patch which also don't help me to understand whats broken. As a minimum the unit test must _fail_ without these modifications, and the commit message must state what it is fixing.
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Reword this and state what you did. For instance:

    Reconfigure interfaces should ignore xxx

(or whatever). Reading the commit message should tell the user what the patch does, and not reference changes in a different repo for a user to figure out.
