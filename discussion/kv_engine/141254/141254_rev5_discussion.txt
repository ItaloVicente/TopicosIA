DESCRIPTION:

Change interface diff logic.

In ns_server, there was a refactor to make interfaces address family specific,
see, http://review.couchbase.org/c/ns_server/+/140669. Example is as
below.

A change is required in the interface diff logic of kv, to identify
address family mismatch after the above refactor. The diff logic prior
to this change would drop an IPv4 interface whose host is <<"*">> and
port is 12000, even though the new wanted interfaces where as per [2]
requiring IPv4. The problem is that the current logic would decide to
drop the IPv4 interface after comparing with the 1st optional interface
which is IPv6.

Example of refactor in interfaces:
[1] Before:
[
 {
    "port": 12000,
    "host": "*",
    "ipv4": "required",
    "ipv6": "optional"
 }
]

[2] After:
[
 {
    "port": 12000,
    "host": "*",
    "ipv4": "off",
    "ipv6": "optional"
 },
 {
    "port": 12000,
    "host": "*",
    "ipv4": "required",
    "ipv6": "off"
 }
]
