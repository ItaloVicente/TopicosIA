DESCRIPTION:

MB-33167 [SR]: Persist durability-abort

Here the main characteristics of a durable-abort item on disk:
- it resides into the Durability Prepare key-space
- it has Metadata::Operation::Abort
- it has the Deleted flag set

Note that persisting an Abort implicitly replaces the previous Prepare.

This patch adds support for both Couchstore and RocksDB.
