DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Remove 'limit' arg from CM::removeClosedUnrefCheckpoints

Limits the number of checkpoints that are removed.
Used only at testing, adds unnecessary complexity to the function.
The same logic can be implemented in tests by limiting the moving of
cursors in checkpoints, thus selecting what checkpoints become eligible
for removal.
