DESCRIPTION:

MB-24971: Signal when stuck in conn_send_data state

During bucket deletion if a connection had a full send buffer it was
possible for it to get into a conn_send_data data due to
McbpConnection::transmit() returning SoftError.

The solution is to ensure that we raise a 'fake' write event in
signalIfIdle to ensure the stalled connection has an event delivered.

The patch also modifies the testapp_bucket test
MB19748TestDeleteWhileConnShipLogAndFullWriteBuffer to
1) Increase the probablity that the test has to cope with SoftErrors
(This is achieved increasing the size of the messages being sent).
2) Ensure that if bucket deletion hangs the test terminates by
explictly closing the connection.

Line:1134, engines/ewouldblock_engine/ewouldblock_engine.cc -> I guess you meant to say "probability of transmit"?

Mostly looks good, but would be good to get Trond's opinion.
Line:369, tests/testapp/testapp_bucket.cc -> This is actually an interesting observation - I added more data to the socket (to trigger a READ event) because conn_ship_log has both read and write events enabled - and hence it would wake up the connection.

However in the conn_send_data state we /don't/ have read enabled - which means we /can't/ detect if the peer connection is closed, as that is indicated by a READ event. 

It's probably out of scope of this bug, but we should perhaps consider keeping the READ event enabled in conn_send_data so we can detect dead connections sooner (and hence remove any resources associated with them).

@Trond - what do you think?

Line:369, tests/testapp/testapp_bucket.cc -> I think we should set a timeout instead... 

Problem with read event is that if the connection send a pipeline of requests, and we block on sending the first reply, we'll get notified on the read event but we're not ready to start processing those commands...

With a timeout we could stop "slow" clients which haven't read their data for let's say 30 sec...
