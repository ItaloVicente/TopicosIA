DESCRIPTION:

MB-21647: Fix intermittent failure in DCP producer testing

In some DCP producer tests a sporadic failure was observed due to
race condition in waiting for 'last_sent_seqno' stat. That is the
'last_sent_seqno' stat was updated correctly at stream level, but
DCP test client assumed that the item was read immediately with the
updation of the stat, but unfortunately in some cases it was not so.

This commit makes sure that the DCP client explicitly waits for the
last item to be read by the client.
