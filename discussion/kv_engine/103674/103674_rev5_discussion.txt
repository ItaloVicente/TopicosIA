DESCRIPTION:

MB-32558: Persist Pending SyncWrites

Pending SyncWrites are stored on disk with a "pending" key prefix.
To avoid any clash with Collection, the prefix is a reserved Collection
ID.

Issues identified and deferred to follow-up patches:

- Backfill. While a Pending must not be found at point-lookup, it must
  at sequence-scan. Note that a Pending key comes out prefixed from the
  storage, so the actual key needs to be restored before passing to the
  Cache and Disk callbacks. In this patch I temporarily skip Pendings at
  KVStore::scan.

- Disk counters. Currently a Pending is accounted into all disk-counters,
  which is wrong (e.g., curr_items should account a SyncWrite only when
  it is Committed).
  
- Commit Pending SyncWrite. At commit, we have to deleted the previous
  temporary Pending. Currently a persisted Pending is never deleted from
  disk.

Line:48, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.cc -> This feels somewhat verbose / repetitive. I don't think calling resize() potentially twice (once for each of the prefixes) is a big deal - esp given anything less than ~20 bytes is stored inside std::string (small string optimisation).

Suggest you use simplify to first add prepare prefix (if necessary), then add collection Id (if necessary) , then the actual key.

Line:65, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.cc -> Similary here, just conditionally do the prepend of the prepare namespace id; and then append the key (i.e. move the std::copy() out of the conditionals).

There's also a case in rollback to consider where we are processing the chunk of keys we're discarding, there's an open bug regarding system events on that code path, but we may need some work as well to rollback prepared keys
Line:36, utilities/dockey.cc -> curious, did you change this function because something broke?

Thanks for this
Line:48, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.cc -> Done

Line:65, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.cc -> Done

Line:36, utilities/dockey.cc -> Correct, meaning that there are good checks in the Collection code :)

Also, this change is worth a small comment, adding it

Currently evaluating if https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-32571 is related to Pending SyncWrite also.

Line:36, utilities/dockey.cc -> Interesting, so this change will mean a pending mutation would become included in the collection's item count, that's ok, I assume the same for the bucket curr_items.

A comment would be good just so a reader knows that you're extracting the real collection-ID from the pending key

Line:36, utilities/dockey.cc -> Comment added.
Also, yes for now a Pending is accounted in curr_items, but that's only temporary as we want to account a SyncWrite only after it is committed.
So, for consistency when we fix curr_items we have to fix also the Collection count.
I added a "disk-count" note to the commit message.
