DESCRIPTION:

MB-32558: Persist Pending SyncWrites

Pending SyncWrites are stored on disk with a "pending" key prefix.
To avoid any clash with Collection, the prefix is a reserved Collection
ID.

Issues identified and deferred to follow-up patches:

- Backfill. While a Pending must not be found at point-lookup, it must
  at sequence-scan. Note that a Pending key comes out prefixed from the
  storage, so the actual key needs to be restored before passing to the
  Cache and Disk callbacks. In this patch I temporarily skip Pendings at
  KVStore::scan.

- Disk counters. Currently a Pending is accounted into all
  disk-counters, which is wrong (e.g., curr_items should account a
  SyncWrite only when it is Committed).

- Commit Pending SyncWrite. At commit, we have to deleted the previous
  temporary Pending. Currently a persisted Pending is never deleted from
  disk.
