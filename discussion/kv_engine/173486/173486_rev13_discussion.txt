DESCRIPTION:

MB-51681: Add tests for MemOverhead{,Queue,Index}

Expand on testCheckpointManagerMemUsage to test the
base case of a single checkpoint's memory
calculations.

Add a test to validate that the CheckpointManager's
getMemOverhead(), getMemOverheadIndex(), and
getMemOverheadQueue() are calculated correctly as
the sum of all Checkpoints managed by the CM.

Line:3373, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> I think that this now conflicts with this change https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/173142. I suspect you can do something like "engine->getCheckpointConfig().setCheckpointMaxSize(0)" to set the size in bytes to 0 for a Checkpoint, and we always allow at least 1 item into a Checkpoint.

Line:3375, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> probably want to make the condition be "key < numCheckpoints" instead for readability

Line:3373, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Yes please, if we can avoid adding other tests that rely on chk_max_items, that would be appreciated ;) One less to fix for me later
