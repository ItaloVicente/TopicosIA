DESCRIPTION:

MB-51681: Add tests for MemOverhead{,Queue,Index}

Expand on testCheckpointManagerMemUsage to test the
base case of a single checkpoint's memory
calculations.

Add a test to validate that the CheckpointManager's
getMemOverhead(), getMemOverheadIndex(), and
getMemOverheadQueue() are calculated correctly as
the sum of all Checkpoints managed by the CM.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Code good, it needs conflicts-fix
Line:3376, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Nit: The test relies on having multiple checkpoints, so I would

  ASSERT_GT(manager.getNumCheckpoints(), 1);

at this point
