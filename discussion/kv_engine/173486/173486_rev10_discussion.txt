DESCRIPTION:

MB-51681: Add tests for MemOverhead{,Queue,Index}

Expand on testCheckpointManagerMemUsage to test the
base case of a single checkpoint's memory
calculations.

Add a test to validate that the CheckpointManager's
getMemOverhead(), getMemOverheadIndex(), and
getMemOverheadQueue() are calculated correctly as
the sum of all Checkpoints managed by the CM.

Line:3337, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> You should probably change this to an assertion if we are going to rely on this later on in the test (i.e. ASSERT_EQ(1, maanger.getNumCheckpoints()). That way, if it's ever not the case, we will abort the test rather than continue on with some invalid assumption that causes later checks to fail

Line:3372, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Do you even care what the value is? You could just in-line this into the store_item call instead.

Line:3372, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Line should be wrapped as it's longer than 80 characters. You can install a commit hook that generally deals with this (https://hub.internal.couchbase.com/confluence/display/cbeng/Using+the+git+clang-format+pre-commit+hook) and/or have CLion do it for you automatically

Line:3373, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> This could be a lot of keys, do you really need however many this ends up being?. It's better to write tests with minimal scenarios (i.e. 1 key in each Checkpoint in this case) as it's easier to reason about and faster. 

You could either manually create a new Checkpoint or lower the Checkpoint max size such that it can only hold one item here.

Line:3373, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Memory allocation ain't as cheap as you'd think ;) Might be interesting to see how long this took before/after on the ASan and TSan variants where that's considerably slower.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:3373, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> I thought this would already be one key per checkpoint - we insert a value with the maxmimum size of each checkpoint, forcing a new one's creation. And we do that the number of checkpoint times.

Would reducing the checkpoint max size before doing this improve runtime? Not sure of the order of magnitude of the default checkpoint max_size.

Line:3373, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Ahh of course, the max size value threw me!

It certainly might reduce runtime, it looks like that string ctor is linear in count https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/basic_string.

Default checkpoint_max_size is based on bucket quota, checkpoint quota as a ratio of bucket quota, max number of checkpoints, and the number of vBuckets in the system. 

Probably worth a quick experiment to see.
