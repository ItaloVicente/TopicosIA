DESCRIPTION:

MB-51681: Add tests for MemOverhead{,Queue,Index}

Expand on testCheckpointManagerMemUsage to test the
base case of a single checkpoint's memory
calculations.

Add a test to validate that the CheckpointManager's
getMemOverhead(), getMemOverheadIndex(), and
getMemOverheadQueue() are calculated correctly as
the sum of all Checkpoints managed by the CM.
