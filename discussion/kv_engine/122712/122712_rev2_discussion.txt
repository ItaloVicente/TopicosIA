DESCRIPTION:

MB-38030: Keep connection open if we can for format errors

If the validator fails to execute a command due to some error
we used to send an error back to the client, and then shut
down the connection unless the command was unknown to the
system.

We don't really have to kill the connection in these cases
(unless there is a problem validating the "frame" which
could cause the system to get out of sync parsing the
input stream).

Given that clients _shouldn't_ be sending invalid encoded
commands to the server there shouldn't be any backwards
compatibility issues related to this.
