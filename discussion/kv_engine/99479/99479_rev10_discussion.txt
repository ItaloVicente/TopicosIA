DESCRIPTION:

MB-31208:  Don't reset frequency counter on a mutation

Each document in the hash table has a frequency counter asscoiated with
it.  The counter is incremented each time the document is read.

Currently if a document is assigned a new value the frequency counter
is reset back to the initialFreqCount of 4.  This is a bug; the
frequency counter should remain unchanged, and is fixed in this patch.

Note:  The original 2-bit_lru eviction policy has the correct behaviour
in that its nru value is not reset when the document is assigned a new
value.
