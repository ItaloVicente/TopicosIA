DESCRIPTION:

MB-33167 [SR]: Notify client at durable-abort

As per Durability specification, when a SyncWrite is aborted we send
AMBIGUOUS to the client.

The reason behind AMBIGUOUS is that at failover scenario an aborted
SyncWrite could be actually Committed by the promoted Replica. Look the
Durability design doc for details.
