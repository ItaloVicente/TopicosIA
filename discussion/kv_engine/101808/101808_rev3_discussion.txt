Line:181, daemon/settings.cc -> What's the magic number here? Can we use a symbolic name instead?

I'd be tempted to keep the exception thrown as the same we used to (std::invalid_argument) - this /isn't/ actually an nlohmann::json exception; I assume you're just using it because it's similar to theirs in meaning.

Line:288, daemon/settings.cc -> Given you're already dispatching to this once per each EventPriority; you could simply just add an extra parameter to handle_reqs_event() of priorityName and remove the need for re-determining what priority this is.

Line:63, daemon/settings.h -> Nit: "and" ? (if you have another change lined up feel free to fix later...)

Line:181, daemon/settings.cc -> Ahh I had forgotten to change this.

The motivation for throwing an nlohmann json exception was mainly to keep tests simple, the config_parse tests have a ton of stuff that relies on an exception of a specific type being thrown, and it was easier to make that type always an nlohmann::json::exception as the majority of times it would be thrown during parsing. I added this (and I think a couple others in this file) so that we would throw the same type and I wouldn't have to modify a substantial amount of tests. Think I only added this for unexpected types where we would typically rely on .get<type> as the meaning was very similar. See http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/mad-hatter/kv_engine/tests/config_parse_test/config_parse_test.cc#53-57

I introduced in a previous patch a throwJsonTypeError function in json_utilities so that I can get rid of all the magic numbers but forgot to make use of it.
