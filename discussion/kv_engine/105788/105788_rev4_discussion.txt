DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor] Remove overload of VBucket::queueDirty

Removing the overload that takes in input an 'exploded' VBQueueItemCtx.
That was directly called only by VBucket::processExpiredItem, even with
default VBQueueItemCtx options.

Also, the (unique) VBucket::queueDirty signature now /requires/ that the
caller provides a HashBucketLock for the StoredValue being processed.
