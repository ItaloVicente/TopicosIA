DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Fix memory tracking bug for magma API

The issue was we were calling the callback in our threads, we would
useObjectRegistry::getCurrentEngine(). That is pulled out of a thread
local variable which is null for our threads, so all memory deleted
from flusher threads would go to a non-existent engine.
