Could you please create / expand an existing a unit test for this issue.

I'm not quite sure how to create a test for this. We don't have the cbstats stuff in yet and the cbstats stuff is not on the magma_dp list so we don't have a way to test/prove its working correctly. I believe Apaar noticed this while debugging. What do you suggest?

Well, how did you identify the memory tracking was incorrect in the first place? I assume Some particular operation / function didn't increment memory tracking as expected?

Therefore, can you create a unit test which does whatever operation which triggered the problem, and check the memory usage before / after changes as expected?

(If you provide more details in the commit message about the precise bug you're fixing I might be able to advise more specifically...)
