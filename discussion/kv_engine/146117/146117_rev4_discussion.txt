DESCRIPTION:

MB-42224: Remove KVStore::setVBucketState()

The semantic of the function is the same of the existing
KVStore::updateCachedVBState(). While the latter is a protected function
called within KVStore::snapshotVBucket, setVBucketState() is a public
one and expected to be called by the user after a successful
KVStore::commit().

Remove setVBucketState() and update the cached vbstate within
KVStore::commit.
