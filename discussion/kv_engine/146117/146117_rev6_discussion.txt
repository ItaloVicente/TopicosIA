DESCRIPTION:

MB-42224: Remove KVStore::setVBucketState()

The semantic of the function is the same of the existing
KVStore::updateCachedVBState(). While the latter is a protected function
called within KVStore::snapshotVBucket, setVBucketState() is a public
one and expected to be called by the user after a successful
KVStore::commit().

Remove setVBucketState() and update the cached vbstate within
KVStore::commit.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

Line:278, engines/ep/src/kvstore.cc -> This is a change in behaviour isn't it? (i.e. we are going to set maxDeletedSeqno now if the condition is false. Looks like this condition is trying to enforce monotonicity. I think it's worth addressing the TODO in this patch and working out if this is necessary or not as we effectively lose this check by just copying the new state beforehand

Line:278, engines/ep/src/kvstore.cc -> You're right, and the same applies to CAS below.

Note
Look at http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/146117/6/engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc 
This is the old code that was executed in updateCachedVBState(), but then we used to always call setVBucketState(proposedVBstate) which executes a (*vbState = proposedVBState) and overrides any previous "computation" on MaxDeletedSeqno and CAS.
So if I remove 272-279 here then we effectively maintain the same logic as before.

Line:278, engines/ep/src/kvstore.cc -> Right, so in the case of setVBucketState things should be the same. But, in the case of snapshotVBucket (which also calls updateCachedVBucketState) we now have the different maxDeletedSeqno/Cas logic for the cached values.

Line:278, engines/ep/src/kvstore.cc -> As discussed offline:

Before the change:

at KVStore::snapshotVBucket() we do:
  1) updateCachedVBState(proposedVBState) that does the computation on CAS etc..
  2) we call setVBucketState(proposedVBState), which effectively overrides whatever change we did at (1)

while at KVStore::commit():
  1) we do nothing
  2) we call setVBucketState(proposedVBState)


so essentially we were already just executing a *cachedVBState = proposedVBState (which is what KVStore::setVBucketState does)

I m removing the @todo and the related code

Line:278, engines/ep/src/kvstore.cc -> Regardless from the fact that we are maintaining the same logic here, we checked the correctness of NOT doing the computation on CAS and MaxDeletedSeqno here.

It turns out that is all fine as in EPBucekt::flushVBucket:

For CAS we do:
    proposedVBState.maxCas = std::max(proposedVBState.maxCas, item->getCas());


For MaxDeletedSeqno we do:
    if (toFlush.maxDeletedRevSeqno) {
        proposedVBState.maxDeletedSeqno = toFlush.maxDeletedRevSeqno.value();
    }
which comes from the CM:
    if (qi->isDeleted() &&
        qi->getRevSeqno() > maxDeletedRevSeqno.value_or(0)) {
        maxDeletedRevSeqno = qi->getRevSeqno();
    }
