DESCRIPTION:

MB-34768: Do not throw if trying to expire a PreparedSyncDelete

Currently, SyncDelete Prepares are not marked as deleted when writing
to disk, but *do* have their expiry time set to "now" for use by the
tombstone purger.

Because of this, the time_purge_hook compaction hook treats them as an
Item past it's expiry time. For now, this is anticipated, and should
not prevent compaction.

Line:2336, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> As per comment on previous patch, this exception is correct - we shouldn't be expiring anything in the prepare namespace.

Suggest you keep the throw as is, but fix the memory leak problem by adding a try / catch block between ep-engine and couchstore (i.e. we shouldn't throw anything past kv-engine code).
