DESCRIPTION:

MB-40095: Ensure DcpSeqnoAdvanced is not sent when SyncReplication is on

Ensure we never send a DcpSeqnoAdvanced is never sent when
SyncReplication is enabled on the DCP connection. Also add logging to
when we add a SeqnoAdvanced to the readyQ to help with debugging if one
is sent in an unexpected manner.

Also add two tests to ensure we do/do not send a DcpSeqnoAdvanced when
SyncReplication is disabled and enabled.

Line:2163, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> I think this method needs some work - it's ambiguous if it should only be called _if_ a SeqnoAck should be generated, or it it is safe to call anytime.

For example, look at the different places it is called from:

- completeBackfill() - Calls it conditionally on a bunch of conditions
- processItems() - Calls it conditionally, on a slightly different set of conditions.
- snapshot() - Unconditionally calls it.

Such a design is error-prone - there's no clear single place where the policy is applied. 

I would look into either

a)  moving all the checks into this method (i.e. unconditionally calling it whenever _potentially_ a SeqnoAdvanced is needed), or
b) Moving all checks out of this method (and renaming it to queueSeqnoAdvanced or similar).

Line:2169, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> This is going to be far too verbose - info log level is on all the time.
