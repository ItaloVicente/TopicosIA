DESCRIPTION:

MB-40095: Ensure DcpSeqnoAdvanced is not sent when SyncReplication is on

Ensure we never send a DcpSeqnoAdvanced is never sent when
SyncReplication is enabled on the DCP connection. Also refactor how we
decide to enqueue a SeqnoAdvanced, to make it clear to the reader.

Also add two tests to ensure we do/do not send a DcpSeqnoAdvanced when
SyncReplication is disabled and enabled.

Line:20, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Shouldn't be necessary - active_stream_impl.h already includes it.

Line:1300, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> I'm not sure this is the best name for the method. SeqnoAdvanced isn't really "enabled", it's more that under certain situations it is necessary to send them over the stream.

I think we really should be describing the situation which leads to seqnoAdvanced being needed - i.e something like "doesStreamSkipSomeItems()" - or something more snappy...

Line:1337, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Not sure about this - what about pending vbuckets?

Why do we even need the vbucket state check here?

Line:1469, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> I don't believe there should be a gap _unless_ "isSeqnoAdvancedEnabled" is true - i.e. this boolean is more complicated than it needs to be - should be

 if (isSeqnoGapAtEndOfSnapshot()) {
     Expects(isSeqnoAdvancedEnabled();
     ...

?

Line:2176, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> This all feels a bit implicit / brittle. 

Can you remind me why a replica vbucket can transition from backfill to memory without a snapshot marker - is that some optimisation?

If so I'm tempted to disable that if collections is being used - I doubt it really buys us much (large snapshots are actually not generally a good thing), and few consumers stream from replicas - view engine is the only one I can think of and does that even support collections?

It also didn't look like any of the new tests were testing the replica state?

Line:605, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> sen -> sent.

Line:608, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> const?

Line:625, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> Might be worth expanding on what "check" means for here.

Line:20, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Done

Line:1300, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> isSeqnoAdvancedEnabled() is more represent if the consumer of the DCP stream supports SeqnoAdvanced feature

Line:1337, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> see the comment above, we're doing the replica disk->memory backfill but realise theres no times for the collection being streamed in memory so we need to send a SeqnoAdvanced.

Line:1469, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> > I don't believe there should be a gap _unless_ "isSeqnoAdvancedEnabled" is true - i.e. this boolean is more complicated than it needs to be - should be

isSeqnoAdvancedEnabled() helps guard against when syncReplication is enabled and ensure this is collection enable stream.
Take for instance if an old client was just streaming the default collection on a legacy connection and their were other collections in the same vbucket thus causing gaps in the snapshot.

Line:2176, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> There are old tests that cover this transition when using a replica vbucket and were added when I initially added the SeqnoAdvanced code to the active stream.

Looking at the commit that introduced the behavior it doesn't necessarily seem to be an optimisation and looks more to do with constiancy see: https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/commit/6f869d133e4d85c7f66df884c2385d06bb64931b && https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-16656

Line:605, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> Done

Line:608, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> Done

Line:625, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> In this case check should be removed this is left of over from the original code comment. Thanks for the spot :)

Will let Jim also look at this.
Line:1337, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Ok. Could you make the above comment a bit more explicit that this is handling the replicas backfill -> memory snapshot merging.
