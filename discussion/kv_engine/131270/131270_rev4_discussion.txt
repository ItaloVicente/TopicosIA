DESCRIPTION:

MB-40095: Ensure DcpSeqnoAdvanced is not sent when SyncReplication is on

Ensure we never send a DcpSeqnoAdvanced is never sent when
SyncReplication is enabled on the DCP connection. Also refactor how we
decide to enqueue a SeqnoAdvanced, to make it clear to the reader.

Also add two tests to ensure we do/do not send a DcpSeqnoAdvanced when
SyncReplication is disabled and enabled.
