DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor] Shrink ServerCookieApi with cookie members

Now that we use a Class for the Cookies and link everything
static we can might as well use virtual getter methods to
check for cookie/connection properties instead of going through
the full "Server API" call chain (which also toggled the memory
domain for allocations; but we didn't allocate anything)
