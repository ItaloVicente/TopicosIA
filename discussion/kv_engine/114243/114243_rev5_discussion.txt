DESCRIPTION:

MB-35661: Abort sync-writes before copying chains

Do the "abortNoLongerPossibleSyncWrites" method before calling
"copyChainPositions".

This is because abortNoLongerPossibleSyncWrites will update
firstChain/secondChain and those updates must be copied by
copyChainPositions. The current ordering exposes a use-after-free. The
test changes alone will trigger ASAN errors on the new test and existing
tests (exposed by calling the ActiveDurabilityMonitor's ostream operator
from TearDown).
