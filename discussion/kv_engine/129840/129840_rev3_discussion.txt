DESCRIPTION:

MB-39375: Add Setting for storage thread

Add a new memcached setting "num_storage_threads" which is a global
configuration value that we can pass through to the engine to set the
appropriate number of backend storage threads. This configuration
parameter will have a default value that can be supplied by passing a
configuration parameter of 0 (for magma this will be 3x the number of
writer threads). The engine also has the same configuration parameter
so that we can pass the Configuration object down to the stores to
correctly calculate and set the number of threads.

In a following patch we will add a "magma_flusher_thread_percentage"
configuration parameter than is required to calculate the appropriate
number of magma flusher and compactor threads.
