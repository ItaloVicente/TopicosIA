DESCRIPTION:

MB-28289: Fix SegFault in GetFailoverLog for non-existing VBucket

The legacy DCP GetFailoverLog logs a message if a non-existing VBucket
is requested. This message includes the DCP connection prefix string.
For non-DCP connections we do not have any prefix, so we set it to
"MCBP-Connection".

Change-Id: Icc7d8aca030a15876c2449f336c1a429c68cd1f5
