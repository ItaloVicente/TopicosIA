DESCRIPTION:

MB-53197: [WIP] Add support for fake bucket

@todo Add tests

@todo verify that there isn't a possibility for a race where
      we would use the old version for the engine handle when
      we create the bucket. Given that we _NEVER_ would read
      the engine member for a fake bucket it shouldn't be
      read? (unless it is in the same cache line as the bucket
      state or bucket type?

@todo it might be safer to allow the second creation to create
      a new entry in the bucket array and move all clients over
      to the new index once created?

@todo DaveR mentioned the suggestion to create a proxy-engine
      similar to ewb... I need to think of how to do that...

@todo One thing this patch doesn't deal with rebalance _out_
      a real engine and replace that with a "fake instance".
      is that something we want to deal with? and if so; will
      ns_server perform a real "delete bucket" and make sure
      that it won't race with a set clustermap?
