DESCRIPTION:

MB-53197: Add support for ClusterConfigOnly bucket

The "ClusterConfigOnly" bucket is a special bucket
ns_server may create automatically by setting a cluster
manifest for the bucket. Clients may then connect
to the bucket and fetch the cluster manifest for the
bucket.

At some point ns_server may create a real bucket
with the same name as the bucket without having to
delete the bucket first.
