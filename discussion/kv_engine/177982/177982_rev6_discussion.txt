DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Add support for fake bucket

@todo Add tests

@todo verify that there isn't a possibility for a race where
      we would use the old version for the engine handle when
      we create the bucket. Given that we _NEVER_ would read
      the engine member for a fake bucket it shouldn't be
      read? (unless it is in the same cache line as the bucket
      state or bucket type?

@todo it might be safer to allow the second creation to create
      a new entry in the bucket array and move all clients over
      to the new index once created?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> one comment about the name
Line:20, daemon/bucket_type.cc -> Dave R. made a comment that we should come up with a better name than "fake bucket" and I agree. 

Some options:
* pseudo bucket
* config-only bucket

And then I couldn't come up with more options. I probably like "config-only" better than "psuedo bucket" of the two above.
