DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Add support for fake bucket

@todo Add tests

@todo verify that there isn't a possibility for a race where
      we would use the old version for the engine handle when
      we create the bucket. Given that we _NEVER_ would read
      the engine member for a fake bucket it shouldn't be
      read? (unless it is in the same cache line as the bucket
      state or bucket type?
