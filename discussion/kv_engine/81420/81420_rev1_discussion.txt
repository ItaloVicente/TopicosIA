DESCRIPTION:

MB-25381: Make begin collection delete flush a system event

BeginDeleteCollection only updated the vb state document and skipped
flushing a system event.

However:

1) This leads to a seqno discrepancy (vb highSeqno above what the
 persisted highseqno)
2) DCP backfill can't determine when a collection was deleted, which
 is inconsistent with an in-memory stream that propagates the begin
 delete as it comes down the checkpoint queue.
