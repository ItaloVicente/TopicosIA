Line:1104, engines/default_engine/default_engine.cc -> This function already returns a uint16_t.

Line:91, engines/default_engine/items.h -> I think this is actually a case where we want to keep uint16_t:

1) default_engine uses this in various places; and it is desirable to keep it as small as possible for performance reasons.
2) I believe we validate the length on the way in (when read from the network) and then store in a uin16_t - and moreover we don't support longer keys - so it's more "correct" to use uint16_t.

Could you highlight the warning you're trying to address with these changes?

Line:87, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_dockey.h -> Probably better to make the object take uint8_t as the input  - that way we don't have to worry about the possibility of getting too long lengths.

Line:31, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.cc -> Similar here - size_t is a more natural type - 

* It cannot be negative; and it doesn't make sense to use a negative type for the count of something.
* The size of int is undefined - it is typically 32bits on our current platforms, but it could differ. Certainly it would limit the number of collections to 4B.

Line:504, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.h -> This looks a bit odd - we probably shouldn't need to cast a constant like this.

Probably makes more sense for seqno to change to int64_t.

Line:80, engines/ep/src/item_eviction.h -> Why 64bit? If 16bit was chosen before, there was probably a reason for it; hence you would either want to change to size_t if no specific size was needed; or understand why 16bit was chosen to begin with.

Line:370, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> As previous.

Line:254, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> I don't think we want to ignore a narrowing error here - if we somehow had a key which was larger than we can store, we'd want to throw an exception.

Line:127, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_checkpoint.cc -> Don't use long - it's size is indeterminate. If you want an arbitrary sized type then size_t is probably the correct one.

What's the error you're trying to avoid here?

Line:178, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/configuration_test.cc -> Prefer lowercase 'f' for float constants (for consistency).

Line:1818, include/memcached/protocol_binary.h -> We use explicit-sized types for all the network encoding - prefer uint32_t.

Line:1187, programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc -> Not sure narrow() makes sense for non-integer types. Prefer reinterpret_cast<>

Line:81, programs/engine_testapp/mock_server.h -> size_t is probably better here if you want an unsigned, arbitrary size.

Line:810, protocol/connection/client_connection.cc -> uint32_t

Line:41, protocol/connection/client_mcbp_commands.cc -> u_short is a windows type - use uint16_t and friends.

Line:46, protocol/connection/client_mcbp_commands.cc -> uint32_t

Line:1104, engines/default_engine/default_engine.cc -> Done

Line:91, engines/default_engine/items.h -> It was the fact that sizeof returns a size_t so the function 'hash_key_get_client_key_len' was complaining about data type size mismatch. Can solve this by casting the sizeof function seen as it returns 4.

Line:87, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_dockey.h -> Done

Line:31, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.cc -> Done

Line:504, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.h -> Done

Line:80, engines/ep/src/item_eviction.h -> The function 'hdr_value_at_percentile' returns uint64_t and given this is a third party module I didn't want to sort the error at it's source. I can cast where we use this though.

Line:370, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> Done

Line:254, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> Done

Line:127, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_checkpoint.cc -> The sprintf expects a long and doesn't like the size_t. Cant change the format string though :)

Line:178, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/configuration_test.cc -> Done

Line:1818, include/memcached/protocol_binary.h -> Done

Line:1187, programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc -> Done

As the previous patch... I think the patch does too many unrelated things... It would be better with a single patch which drops all variable names from exceptions, then one which fix a different kind of error etc..
Line:715, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> would probably be better to change ioviused_high_watermark to size_t to keep the datatype the same?

Line:253, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> If we're changing this it should be:

    return (currentEvent & EV_READ) == EV_READ;

(which also works if EV_READ is a combination of multiple bits)

Line:259, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> ditto

Line:192, engines/default_engine/items.cc -> perhaps better to change the API to be unsigned...

Line:127, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_checkpoint.cc -> This code can might as well just use:

    const std::string key = "key" + std::to_string(j);
