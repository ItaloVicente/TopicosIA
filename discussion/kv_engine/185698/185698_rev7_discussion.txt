DESCRIPTION:

MB-54853: DCP: Allow consumers to optionally skip rollback due to purged deletes

Add support for a new StreamRequest flag: 'Ignore Purged Tombstones'.

Quoting from the documentation:

  Request that the server skips rolling back if the client is behind
  the purge seqno, but the request is otherwise valid and satifiable
  (i.e. no other rollback checks such as UUID mismatch fail).

  The client could end up missing purged tombstones (and hence could
  end up never being told about a document deletion).

  The intent of this flag is to allow clients who ignore deletes to
  avoid rollbacks to zero which are solely due to them being behind
  the purge seqno.

Adds the new flag to the protocol, and handles it in DcpProducer - if
the flag is set then the request ignores the vBucket's purgeSeqno and
treats it as zero.
