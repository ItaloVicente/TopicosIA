DESCRIPTION:

MB-41804: Correct replica overhead tracking

Mad-hatter uses MemoryTrackingAllocator to accurately account for the
overhead of checkpoint overheads.

This should be used in tracking replica overhead instead of the
approximate/manual accounting based on sizeof.

Additionally, expelling was not present in alice, where replica
overhead tracking was introduced. Replica overhead must also be
adjusted during expelling.
