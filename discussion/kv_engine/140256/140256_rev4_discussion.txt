DESCRIPTION:

MB-41804: Correct replica overhead tracking

Mad-hatter uses MemoryTrackingAllocator to accurately account for the
overhead of checkpoint overheads.

This should be used in tracking replica overhead instead of the
approximate/manual accounting based on sizeof.

Additionally, expelling was not present in alice, where replica
overhead tracking was introduced. Replica overhead must also be
adjusted during expelling.

Line:219, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Why is the value decremented from coreLocal.memOverhead different to what the callback is called with?

Line:681, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> This appears unused - you're using gsl::finally instead?

Line:577, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> This appears identical to the code in queueDirty() - suggest you put into a common helper class or similar.

Line:219, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> to keep the coreLocal memOverhead unchanged, while using the tracking allocator tracked values for the replica overhead tracking.
There's some duplication here to be sure, but the replica overhead tracking is reliable when using the tracking allocator values.
Could investigate whether memOverhead should use the same method or not, but I'd rather not do that in this patch.

Line:681, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Done

Line:577, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> It looks identical but both one is within a checkpoint, the other is at the checkpoint manager level. getMemoryOverhead() is the name of a method in both classes.
I took it out of the RAII helper as using one helper in both places means some mixture of passing in a checkpoint (not available here) or checkpoint manager or lambdas for getMemoryOverhead and overheadChangedCallback.
I had a variant which just took the checkpoint manager, but the manager getMemoryOverhead() would be inefficient to use in queueDirty as it sums across all checkpoints.
This usage here can't be conveniently pushed down into the checkpoint, as the items aren't deallocated until the end of this method.
Can move to lambdas or just two different RAII helpers that are only used once or any other preferred alternative.

Line:219, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Done. I'm going to poke into this a little more at some point, I don't recall if the core local overhead is updated during expelling...
But either way, it hasn't regressed as part of this change so that can be a separate concern 😊

Line:219, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> I think it's worth a comment in the code explaining the difference.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:577, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Thanks for the explanation.

Given the extra boilerplate you've had to add / checks for checkpoint being null; might be more obvious to just keep the two lambdas using gsl::finally.
