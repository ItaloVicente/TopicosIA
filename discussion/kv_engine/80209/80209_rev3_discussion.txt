DESCRIPTION:

MB-25097: In 'Ephemeral + fail_new_data' fail rebalance on full mem usage.

In Ephemeral buckets, with fail_new_data policy, if replication or
rebalance results in a condition wherein there is not enough memory for
data items on the consumer node, then we must fail such a rebalance
or replication rather than hang.

This commit disconnects the DCP consumer connection if items
are received on it with the memory usage beyond replication
throttle (99%).

Line:1889, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Poonam had questions on what tests we are doing to ensure that: with this DISCONNECT, ns_server is informed and it handles all rebalance/replication related stuff correctly.
I can't think of any unit tests for the same. Any test runner level test we must request QE to validate this ?

Line:1883, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Style: Now this is a tri-state, suggest changing the if / else if to a switch statement - this ensures we have all cases covered, and makes the code more self-documenting (it's explicit what the possible options are).

Line:1889, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Well, with your unit test change we have a test that the connection is disconnected in this instance. Obviously we don't have any tests in the kv-engine repo for how ns_server handles this situation.

As far as testrunner is concerned, you'd have to ask QE if they have any tests for high memory usage. However, the recent tests which Tommie was running (MB-25102) before we adjusted the sizing were running OOM, so maybe QE can create a simplified version of that?

Line:63, engines/ep/src/replicationthrottle.cc -> We don't appear to modify config, can therefore be a const&

Line:71, engines/ep/src/replicationthrottle.cc -> Note: This is identical to the base class's implementation. Suggest you replace with a call to the base class method here, and then adjust it to Disconnect as appropriate below.

(This means that if we need to change the underlying criteria in future, we're not updating in two places in the code).

Line:60, engines/ep/src/replicationthrottle.h -> Suggest adding a description of this class.

Line:1855, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> I think it would be better here to create different variants of this test case (see the instantiation of ConnectionTest at the bottom of the file) - instantiate for each of persistent, ephemeral-auto-delete & ephemeral-fail-new-data, and then check we do the correct thing in each situation.

See http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/80273/5 where I add similar variants for item_pager_test.
