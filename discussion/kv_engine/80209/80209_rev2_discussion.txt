DESCRIPTION:

MB-25097: In 'Ephemeral + fail_new_data' fail rebalance on full mem usage.

In Ephemeral buckets, with fail_new_data policy, if a rebalance results
in a condition wherein there is not enough memory for data items after
rebalance, then we must fail such a rebalance rather than hang.

This commit disconnects the DCP consumer connection if items
are received on it with the memory usage beyond replication
throttle (99%).

Line:316, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Is this an unrelated change? It's not obvious from the commit message how this fits into this bug. If it's unrelated please split into a separate patch, otherwise please explain what this is for in the commit msg.

Line:1883, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> As per comment on previous review; please don't do this - why should a Passive DCP stream care about what type of bucket (and the full policy?

Instead I suggest you enhance the ReplicationThrottle class - say create a subclass for Ephemeral, and modify shouldProcess() to return a tai-state enum:

 {Process, Pause, Disconnect}
