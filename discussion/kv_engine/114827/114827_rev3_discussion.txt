DESCRIPTION:

MB-35979: Ensure SyncAdds check for committed values

A SyncAdd should only succeed if there is no committed value (or the
committed value is logically non-existent e.g., expired).

This patch fixes a bug affecting ephemeral buckets allowing SyncAdds
even if there is a committed value. Process add previously only tested
the state of the passed stored value - this is insufficient as the
passed value may be a completed prepare, which does not provide
information on whether a _committed_ value exists.
