DESCRIPTION:

MB-50310: Add a DCP stream from latest feature

A client may have the need to just start streaming from the current
server state, no need to obtain all historical data. A client could
discover vbucket high-seqno to do this with a stat or get-vb-seqnos
command, but to save on those extra round-trips provide a direct
way to stream from "now".

This is implemented similarly to the existing stream-to "now" feature
that is enabled by setting the correct flag on stream request.

When a client specifies the stream-from-latest flag (flag 0x40) the
following stream-request parameters are ignored

* start-seqno
* snap-start, snap-end
* vbucket-uuid

These values are then set as follows.

start-seqno = snap-start = snap-end = current high-seqno
vbucket-uuid = current vb-uuid

The client's stream-request will return the failover table (so they
can then resume if required) and the stream will begin at the next
change to the vbucket.
