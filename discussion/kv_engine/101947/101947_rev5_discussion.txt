DESCRIPTION:

MB-31908: Add GET_COLLECTION_ID protocol command

Add a collection protocol command that allows a client
to lookup a collection-ID from a 'path', where a path
is a scope.collection string.

This commit adds engine API changes to connect the
Manifest::getCollectionID to a command executor.
