DESCRIPTION:

MB-31869: Provide ability for consumer to not buffer DCP messages

First, let's sum up how FlowControl currently works. That is related to
Replication Throttling and DCP buffering at Consumer.

1) Producer and Consumer negotiates a max DCP buffer size when the DCP
connection is initialized. This buffer size becomes the size of the
BufferLog at Producer, see below.

2) The Producer starts sending messages to the Consumer. The Producer
adds the number of bytes sent to its BufferLog. The Consumer receives
messages and acks back the bytes received to the Producer via BufferAck.

3) The Producer receives BufferAcks and removes bytes from its
BufferLog.

4) The Producer pause if the BufferLog is full. That happens when (for
any reason) the Consumer delays in ingesting the inbound DCP traffic.

As (4) suggests, OOM at Consumer is only one reason why the Consumer may
delay in processing incoming DCP messages and acking bytes back to the
Producer.

And now on Replication Throttling.
Replication Throttling guards the Consumer for OOM. We have a
Replication Throttling Threshold (defaulted to 99% of the bucket quota)
which is where the Consumer stops processing the received DCP messages.

The Consumer acks back to the Producer only bytes of messages processed.
So again, if Throttling kicks is then the Consumer stops acking bytes back
to the Producer. This time for an OOM condition.

Now on the DCP buffering at Consumer, which is the core of this patch.
How does that fit in what I have described above?
When the Consumer hits OOM, it stops processing messages by adding them
into each PassiveStream::buffer. Bytes for buffered messages are *not*
acked, which means that at some point the BufferLog at Producer becomes
full and replication pauses.

This patch just provides an alternative to buffering at Consumer. Rather
than buffering messages we just pause the Consumer when we hit OOM.
That means not draining the inbound socket buffer at Consumer and not
acking bytes back to the Producer. As soon as we recover from the OOM
condition, we unpause the Consumer and everyting proceed as usual. Which
leaves the throttling mechanism logically unchanged.

First of all, that simplifies the logic considerably at Consumer in an
area that has already caused issues (eg, MB-31547).
Plus, doing extra buffering on a node that has already hit OOM doesn't
really help.

A configuration parameter is provided to allow easy switching between
using the buffer or not. Once we have gained confidence in not using
the buffer the switch and associated buffering code will be removed.
