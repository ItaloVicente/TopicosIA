DESCRIPTION:

MB-53053: Add QuotaSharingItemPager

Added a new subclass of ItemPager which evicts items from a set of
buckets and stops eviction when sum(mem_used) < sum(low_wat).

Changed the ItemPager factory method to return an instance of the
QuotaSharingItemPager which is shared between quota sharing
configurations.

The QuotaSharingItemPager's schedulePagingVisitors implementation uses
the CrossBucketVisitorAdapter to schedule paging visitors for all
buckets sharing HT quotas.

The adapter round-robins which bucket's paging visitor gets to run.
This is done to avoid evicting more items from buckets which have more
items resident below the MFU eviction threshold (HTs more densely
populated with such items, which would be faster to evict from if we
were just running the visitors concurrently without syncronisation).
