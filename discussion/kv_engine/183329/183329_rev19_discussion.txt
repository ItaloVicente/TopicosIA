DESCRIPTION:

MB-53053: Add QuotaSharingItemPager

Added a new subclass of ItemPager which evicts items from a set of
buckets and stops eviction when sum(mem_used) < sum(low_wat).

The QuotaSharingItemPager's schedulePagingVisitors implementation uses
the CrossBucketVisitorAdapter to schedule paging visitors for all
buckets sharing HT quotas.

The adapter round-robins which bucket's paging visitor gets to run.
This is done to avoid evicting more items from buckets which have more
items resident below the MFU eviction threshold (HTs more densely
populated with such items, which would be faster to evict from if we
were just running the visitors concurrently without synchronisation).

The QuotaSharingItemPager instance will be moved to the
QuotaSharingManager and shared between buckets with quota sharing
enabled in a future patch. For now, just create one per engine, so we
can test the implementation in the degenerate case where we only have
one bucket running with quota-sharing.

Line:654, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> maybe quota_sharing? cbhtqs is definitely nice and concise, but might be a bit opaque to a future reader (but then again, they could search for it and find this line which would make it clear)

Line:300, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> I still think the config stuff you added is :chefs_kiss: so neat.

possibly redundant ()?
