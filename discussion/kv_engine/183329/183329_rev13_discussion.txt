DESCRIPTION:

MB-53053: Add QuotaSharingItemPager

Added a new subclass of ItemPager which evicts items from a set of
buckets and stops eviction when sum(mem_used) < sum(low_wat).

The QuotaSharingItemPager's schedulePagingVisitors implementation uses
the CrossBucketVisitorAdapter to schedule paging visitors for all
buckets sharing HT quotas.

The adapter round-robins which bucket's paging visitor gets to run.
This is done to avoid evicting more items from buckets which have more
items resident below the MFU eviction threshold (HTs more densely
populated with such items, which would be faster to evict from if we
were just running the visitors concurrently without syncronisation).

The QuotaSharingItemPager instance will be moved to the
QuotaSharingManager and shared between buckets with quota sharing
enabled in a future patch. For now, just create one per engine, so we
can test the implementation in the degenerate case where we only have
one bucket running with quota-sharing.

(6 comments)
Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> synchronisation

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Only partially reviewed (up to quota_sharing_item_pager.h)
Line:7052, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> configuration.json? Might want a new value for cross-Bucket concurrent pagers.

Line:7063, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> We shouldn't need to cancel before run - just set an initialSleep time of INT_MAX.

(Note cancel means it's not listed in the set of tasks the ExecutorPool is tracking).

Line:115, engines/ep/src/item_pager.h -> Somewhat orthogonal to this change, but we should look at getting rid of periodic sleeping for Item Pagers - I think we _should_ be able to make it entirely event-driven.

Line:40, engines/ep/src/quota_sharing_item_pager.h -> You probably don't need an explicit constructor for a 5-arg ctor and there's no other constructors...

Line:7052, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Could we possibly have these in memcached.json?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7052, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Not sure mem_used would be an input. 

We probably want to put it the "memcached" settings - while it's not directly a setting for memcached / all engines, that does give us a single location where if the value changes multiple buckets can listen and pick up the difference - for example how num_storage_threads works.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7052, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> I thought that is per-engine configuration? 

(I was thinking what would make sense once we have all of the CBMS work done (paging + memory condition triggers + bg fetching) is to benchmark what makes sense in configurations more similar to what we expect in production. It might make sense to have a num_pagers_per_bucket or similar, or maybe a formula to compute that from mem_used?)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7063, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Agreed. This is what the existing implementation does, I've just moved that into this factory method. I think changing it in a future patch might be cleaner as the initialSleep is a hard-coded value of 10s inside the ItemPager base class?
