DESCRIPTION:

MB-51295: Remove CM::hasClosedCheckpointWhichCanBeRemoved

Used only in the ActiveStream code for determining whether cursor move
has made checkpoints eligible for removal (ie, Lazy removal).
Unnecessary with Eager removal and also a waste of schedule/runtime as
the call was made regardless of Eager/Lazy.
