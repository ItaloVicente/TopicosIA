DESCRIPTION:

MB-20940: [18/n] Tap Removal - Remove the Producer class

As part of Tap Removal, this patch removes the Producer class.  Most
of the functions are removed, however the small number that are
required are moved to the DcpProducer class.

Also removed the reconnects stat which is only used by TAP.
The ep_dcp_queue_backfillremaining stat is also never incremented
in DCP and so is removed.
