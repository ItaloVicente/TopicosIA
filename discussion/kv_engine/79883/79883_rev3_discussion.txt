DESCRIPTION:

MB-24966: Add skip_conflict_resolution flag for with_meta operations

Rename the existing SKIP_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_FLAG to be
FORCE_WITH_META_OP as it

1) skips conflict checks
2) allows writes to replica and pending vbuckets

Add a new SKIP_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_FLAG option that only skips
conflict checking.

Nothing blocking; few suggestions for improvements if you have time.
Line:42, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> Would the APIs read a bit clearer if this was renamed to:

 PermittedVBStates { Active, ActiveReplicaPending }

or similar?

Line:1582, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Wonder how much effort it would be to say pass in a std::bitset<> of the valid vbucket states, and then we can simplify to:

 if (!allowedStates[vb->getState()]) {
    return ENGINE_NOT_MY_VBUCKET;
 }

?

Line:202, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_with_meta.cc -> OOI, what's the reason for this change? I assumed that you were now testing different numbers of testData, but I couldn't see anything other than 4...

Request from Tai to merge this *after* the beta refresh since it's a moderately sized change

Logically +2, but at Tai's request deferring this until after the Beta.

got some tidying to do after more reading, will look at the comments and see what a bitset looks like
Line:41, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> This should of been removed

Line:1582, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> certainly considered, but just went down the 'boolean' enum route...  i think a bitset of states would work if i can get the wrapper on bitset nice

Line:202, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_with_meta.cc -> It went through a number of iterations in the original commit for this file because of MSVC 2013 crashes, trying vector/array etc... but turning out to be something else altogether and at that time the code was in array mode...

The first cut of testing on this commit I had a test where I tried to reuse one of the common functions but with less inputs so switched to vector... changed tack but didn't back out the array->vector change, so it's now not needed
