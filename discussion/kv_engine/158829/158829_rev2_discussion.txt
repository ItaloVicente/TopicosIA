DESCRIPTION:

MB-47762: Correct magma manifest uid overwriting bug

Currently MagmaKVStore will overwrite the manifest uid from whatever
it was to 0 should we flush a batch of items containing only the
update of an item that is logically deleted on disk (i.e. belongs to
an old collection generation). The manifest uid should remain at the
previous value.
