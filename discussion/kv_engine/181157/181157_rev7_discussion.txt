DESCRIPTION:

MB-52682: Derive initial MFU of bgfetched values from MFU histograms

Currently items bgfetched from disk will have their freq counter set to
whatever value was present when the item was _persisted_, even if it
had been increased significantly before the item was eventually
evicted.

This freq counter may be very different to the current distribution in
memory (e.g., bgfetched with MFU 4, everything else >100).
Additionally, as age is determined from cas rather than "time in
memory", bgfetched items may be old enough to immediately be eligible
for eviction.

This may negatively impact some workloads by repeatedly ejecting a
frequently read item and bgfetching it back in with a low MFU, while
frequently written items update the value on disk so would be bgfetched
with a more "up to date" MFU.

Each vbucket currently tracks a histogram of the frequency counter of
all stored values which are eligible for eviction.

This patch uses these histograms select an appropriate frequency
counter for bgfetched items.
