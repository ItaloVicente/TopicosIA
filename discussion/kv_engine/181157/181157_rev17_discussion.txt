DESCRIPTION:

MB-52682: Derive initial MFU of bgfetched values from MFU histograms

Currently items bgfetched from disk will have their freq counter set to
Item::initialFreqCount (currently 4). For the upfront_mfu_only strategy,
age is not considered, and so bgfetched items are immediately eligible
for eviction and will have a low frequency count.

Additionally, for the learning_age_and_mfu strategy, as age is
determined from cas rather than "time in memory", bgfetched items may
be old enough to immediately be eligible for eviction.

Each vbucket currently tracks a histogram of the frequency counter of
all stored values which are eligible for eviction.

This patch uses these histograms select an appropriate frequency
counter for bgfetched items.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The commit message doesn't seem to match up with the change - carries a lot over from the parent when this patch independent doesn't do much other than use the newly developed code of the parent change - i'd suggest simplifying this commit message
