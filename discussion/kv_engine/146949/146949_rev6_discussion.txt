DESCRIPTION:

MB-44496: Expose per-operation timing histograms for Prometheus

Per-op, end-to-end, timing info is currently available from mctimings.

kv_cmd_time_taken_seconds histograms were previously equivalent to
values available from `cbstats timings` - get_cmd, store_cmd and so on.
These timings do _not_ track the full server-side processing time,
rather specific phases of processing these ops internal to ep-engine.

To better meet user expectations of timing data, this patch removes the
existing kv_cmd_time_taken_seconds, replacing it with the better named
kv_cmd_duration_seconds which uses the same data as mctimings.

There will now be a instance of kv_cmd_duration_seconds exposed for a
selection of relevant opcodes, with label "opcode" taking one of the
following values:

    GET
    SET
    ADD
    REPLACE
    DELETE
    INCREMENT
    DECREMENT
    APPEND
    PREPEND
    TOUCH
    GAT
    GET_REPLICA
    OBSERVE_SEQNO
    OBSERVE
    GET_LOCKED
    UNLOCK_KEY
    GET_META
    SET_WITH_META
    ADD_WITH_META
    DEL_WITH_META
    RETURN_META
    SUBDOC_MULTI_LOOKUP
    SUBDOC_MULTI_MUTATION

Line:45, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why did we choose just this subset and not lets say all of the individual subdoc operations?

Line:45, /COMMIT_MSG -> Most of the subdoc opcodes were excluded as it appears the SDKs don't make use of them, doing everything as a multi_X instead

Line:45, /COMMIT_MSG -> (part of the motivation for asking is also that given that we pick out a subset of ops we also need to make changes to this list whenever we add a new command.. we've had that problem a number of times earlier that we suddenly forgot to add stats for a command (both the "number of commands exeucted", errors etc)). Thats why it seems better to just add "all" and leave it up to someone else to filter out the ones they need)

Line:45, /COMMIT_MSG -> That makes sense. The wider context is that adding more histograms here comes with a cost to collect, format, and serve them (not that large or frequent really) and to store/manage them in prometheus.

We could _potentially_ export everything. Empty histograms generate 3 time series, and presumably don't add too much cost to Prometheus to store if the value never changes - based on https://promcon.io/2016-berlin/talks/the-prometheus-time-series-database/ (specifically https://youtu.be/HbnGSNEjhUc?t=1305 ) constant values really shouldn't use that much storage. So customers are only really paying for what they use.

It will still cost cpu at metric gathering time, and at query time.

Line:45, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might be worth doing some basic performance measurements (CPU, mem or kv_engine, ns_sever, prometheus?) of the current approach vs all opcodes; say with a representative workload which is doing at least ~10 of the common opcodes above.
