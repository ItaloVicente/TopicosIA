DESCRIPTION:

MB-44496: Expose per-operation timing histograms for Prometheus

Per-op, end-to-end, timing info is currently available from mctimings.

kv_cmd_time_taken_seconds histograms were previously equivalent to
values available from `cbstats timings` - get_cmd, store_cmd and so on.
These timings do _not_ track the full server-side processing time,
rather specific phases of processing these ops internal to ep-engine.

To better meet user expectations of timing data, this patch removes the
existing kv_cmd_time_taken_seconds, replacing it with the better named
kv_cmd_duration_seconds which uses the same data as mctimings.

There will now be a instance of kv_cmd_duration_seconds exposed for a
each valid opcode, with label "opcode".
