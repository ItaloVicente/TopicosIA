DESCRIPTION:

Revert "MB-36249: Replace notification pipe FDs with libevent event_active()"

Numbers from daily performance runs (KV : Pillowfight, 20/80 R/W, 256B
binary items) shows that this actually _reduces_ performance by ~2%
(see build 4631 vs 4632).

A brief look at the libevent code _suggests_ this is due to
event_active() needing to acquire the per-event base mutex, which
wasn't the case with the previous implementation which just wrote to
an FD.

Reverting to restore previous performance.

This reverts commit 4e021f71f7bbc2475657135b374c5fa5b3a37726.
