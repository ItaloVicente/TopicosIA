DESCRIPTION:

MB-34318: Do not reset SyncWrite::ackCount at topology reset.

Consider the following case given by the below test:

1) Replication topology with 3 replicas (replica 1, 2, 3)
2) Majority SyncWrite (active implicitly acks)
3) Replica 1 acks (majority is 3 so no action)
4) Topology change to introduce second chain
(active, replica1, replica2, undefined) - this resets the SyncWrite
ack counts to 0 for both chains then our call to updateHighPreparedSeqno
sets ack count to 1
5) Replica 2 acks (majority is 3 which we now *should* meet) however
ackCount is only 2

Fix this by manually setting the ackCount for each SyncWrite after a
topology change.
