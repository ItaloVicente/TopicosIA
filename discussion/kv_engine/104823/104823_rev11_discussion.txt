DESCRIPTION:

MB-33038 [SR]: DCP Consumer knows if Producer supports Sync Repl

Enhance the DCP Sync Replication negotiation for letting the Consumer
know if the Producer supports Sync Repl.

This will be used at Consumer to decide if a DCP_SEQNO_ACK must be sent
over the connection. Note that, while a pre-MH Producer will never send
SyncWrites (and so, the Consumer will never need to SEQNO_ACK), during
cluster-topology changes we may need to distinguish between pre-MH and
MH Producers. E.g.:
- nodes Active and Replica, both MH
- Replica has some Prepares in memory, not yet ack'ed
- failover + NewActive: now NewActive is a pre-MH node
- at this point a NewActive->Replica connection is established, but we
  do not want to send any SEQNO_ACK to the Producer

Also, the new feature can be used as a general way for a Consumer to
distinguish between MH and pre-MH Producers, which can be useful at
Online Upgrade.

Line:320, engines/ep/src/connhandler.h -> I don't think Relaxed memory ordering is sufficient here - you need at least release-acquire (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/memory_order). Given we expect this to be set once I't just keep it simple and use std::atomic<bool>.

Line:989, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> You don't really need to tag functional code with MBs - it just adds noise.

(For bugs in backports it can be helpful, but not so for just general new functionality).

Line:1515, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Prefer a switch statement - that way we ensure all cases are handled (now and in future if new ones are added).

Line:22, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_dcp_conn_map.h -> You don't need this if you move makeConsumer to the .cc
