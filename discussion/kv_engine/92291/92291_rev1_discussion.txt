DESCRIPTION:

Disable stats connections test under TSAN until its fixed

We know that the code cause TSAN to complain (by desing), and
there is ongoing effort to fix that. Disable the test under TSAN
until the code is fixed so that we may let TSAN check that we
don't introduce regressions elsewhere in the code.
