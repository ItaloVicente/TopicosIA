DESCRIPTION:

MB-27290: Add "STRICT_VBUUID" flag in DCP_ADD_STREAM

Clients can have a diverging (w.r.t producer) branch at start_seqno 0
and in such a case, some of them strictly need a rollback (MB-25785)
and others strictly don't.

That is, some clients like the backup client in MB-25785, expect a
rollback at seqno 0 upon vb_uuid mismatch. This is because the client
wants to track what snapshot it is building even if that starts from
seqno 0. However, other legacy clients like our own DCP replication
consumer in 4.5.x and lower release versions, are not tuned to
handle rollbacks at seqno 0 upon vb_uuid mismatch (that is, they
will not try to get a matching vb_uuid upon a rollback at seqno 0)
as they don't care about the diverging history at seqno 0.

This commit adds a flag "DCP_ADD_STREAM_STRICT_VBUUID" in the
DCP_ADD_STREAM call so that the clients that demand a rollback when
there is a diverging branch at start_seqno 0 can identify themselves
by setting that flag.
