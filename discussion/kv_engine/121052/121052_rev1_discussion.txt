DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Early-return if nothing to flush in EPBucket::flushVBucket

Before this change, the logic is:

  if (have-something-to-flush) {
    <many lines of code for flushing to disk>
  }
  <epilogue>

The epilogue, which is executed regardless of whether we have flushed
or not, performs:
  - KVStore::pendingTasks()
  - Notify HighPriority Requests (ie, Seqno Persistence reqs)
  - Wakeup CheckpointRemover if CM has checkpoints that can be removed

With this change we remove the extra indentation of many lines of code:

  if (nothing-to-flush) {
    return;
  }
  <many lines of code for flushing to disk>
  <epilogue>

The side effect of this is that we do /not/ execute the <epilogue> if we
early-return. But:
  - KVStore::pendingTasks() does not need to be executed as by definition
    "is called after persisting a batch of data to perform any pending
    tasks on the underlying store"
  - There is definitely no HighPrio reqs to notify as we have not
    persisted anything

The 3rd and last step in the epilogue is waking up the CheckpointRemover.
I am keeping that step even for when 'nothing-to-flush' by doing it just
after the call to VB::getItemsForPersistence(), as the persistence-cursor
could have just moved to the beginning of a new checkpoint and made the
previous one available for removal.
Note that before this change we missed to wake up the CheckpointRemover
before some nested return statement. Which is fixed in this patch.
