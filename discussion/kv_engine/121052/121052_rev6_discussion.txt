DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Early-return if nothing to flush in EPBucket::flushVBucket

Before this change, the logic is:

  if (have-something-to-flush) {
    <many lines of code for flushing to disk>
  }
  <epilogue>

The epilogue, which is executed regardless of whether we have flushed
or not, performs:
  - KVStore::pendingTasks()
  - Notify HighPriority Requests (ie, Seqno Persistence reqs)
  - Checkpoint related operations:
    - Wakeup CheckpointRemover if CM has checkpoints that can be removed
    - Notify satisfied CheckpointPersistence requests, if any

With this change we remove the extra indentation of many lines of code:

  if (nothing-to-flush) {
    return;
  }
  <many lines of code for flushing to disk>
  <epilogue>

The side effect of this is that we do /not/ execute the <epilogue> if we
early-return. But:
  - KVStore::pendingTasks() does not need to be executed as by
    definition "is called after persisting a batch of data to perform
    any pending tasks on the underlying store"
  - There is definitely no HighPrio reqs to notify as we have not
    persisted anything
So that is fine.

Now about the Checkpoint related operations.
I am keeping those even for when 'nothing-to-flush' by executing them
just after the call to VB::getItemsForPersistence(), as the persistence
cursor could have just moved to the beginning of a new checkpoint, which
may:
  - make the previous checkpoint available for removal
  - satisfy some pending CheckpointPersistence request

Note that before this change we missed to execute both Checkpoint
operations before some nested return statement. Which is fixed here.

For reference, the CheckpointPersistence command seems to be just legacy
from TAP, so we can probably remove it.
