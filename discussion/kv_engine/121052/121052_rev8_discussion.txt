DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Early-return if nothing to flush in EPBucket::flushVBucket

Before this change, the logic is:

  if (have-something-to-flush) {
    <many lines of code for flushing to disk>
  }
  <epilogue>

The epilogue, which is executed regardless of whether we have flushed
or not, performs:
  - KVStore::pendingTasks()
  - Notify satisfied SeqnoPersistence requests
  - Checkpoint related operations:
    - Wakeup CheckpointRemover if CM has checkpoints that can be removed
    - Notify satisfied CheckpointPersistence requests

With this change we remove the extra indentation of many lines of code:

  if (nothing-to-flush) {
    return;
  }
  <many lines of code for flushing to disk>
  <epilogue>

The side effect of this is that we do /not/ execute the <epilogue> if we
early-return. But:
  - KVStore::pendingTasks() does not need to be executed as by
    definition "is called after persisting a batch of data to perform
    any pending tasks on the underlying store"
  - There is definitely no HighPrio reqs to notify as we have not
    persisted anything
So that is fine.

Now about the Checkpoint related operations:
  - Wakeup CheckpointRemover
      I am keeping this by executing it unconditionally just after the
      call to VB::getItemsForPersistence(), as the persistence cursor
      could have just moved to the beginning of a new checkpoint, which
      may make the previous checkpoint eligible for removal.
      Also, it is safe to execute this step regardless of whether (1)
      nothing-to-flush or (2) flush-success or (3) flush-failure.
      Note that before this change we missed to execute this step before
      some nested return statement. Which is fixed here.
  - Notify satisfied CheckpointPersistence request
      This step must still be executed if we early-return because
      (again) the persistence cursor could have moved.
      But, we cannot execute this step unconditionally because we cannot
      notify if we perform a flush and the flush fails.
      So, this step is executed if (1) nothing-to-flush or (2)
      flush-success, but not executed if (3) flush-failure.

For reference, the CheckpointPersistence command seems to be just legacy
from TAP, so we can probably remove it in a follow-up.
