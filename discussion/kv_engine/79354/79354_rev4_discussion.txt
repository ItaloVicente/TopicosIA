DESCRIPTION:

MB-22163: Recover value-eviction performance loss with store_if

Introduce a new engine method called store_if, this method
is exactly like store but takes a predicate (std::function).

For set and replace, they will call the predicate on the existing
item (if any) and if the predicate returns true, the store will
continue.

Memcached is changed to make use of store_if so that it can avoid
a get for determining if an existing item has xattrs.

store_if is tried first and if it fails because the existing item
has xattrs, then the slower read/modify/write path is chosen.

This recovers approx 10% in op/s primarily because we reduce the
hash-table locking (your mileage may vary).

Mostly looks good; just a few relatively small suggestions:
Line:419, daemon/connection.cc -> This confused me initially - I read it as "store if the predicate is false". I know in hindsight it does match the name of the function, but maybe we can tweak to make it a little clearer. Something like: ENGINE_PREDICATE_FAILED?

Line:228, daemon/protocol/mcbp/mutation_context.cc -> Given the move to returning `out` params directly via std::tuple, would be nicer to return newCAS instead of making it an out param.

Line:664, engines/default_engine/default_engine.cc -> Won't this always be true - the predicate is non-optional, right?

Line:741, engines/default_engine/items.cc -> Can this be implemented in terms of item_get() below - i.e. just call the new item_get() here.

Line:196, engines/default_engine/items.h -> lookup

Line:202, engines/default_engine/items.h -> Can `key` be null? if not then reference would be preferable.

Line:2323, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Might be worth creating a separate histogram for this - would give us more information on when people are potentially manipulating XATTRs. What do you think?

Line:2395, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Suggest changing this to just implement in terms of store_if  - i.e. pass a predicate which just returns true.

Line:126, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> This seems unnecessary for ADD - it will already fail if any existing item exists.

Line:477, include/memcached/engine.h -> This seems a bit incorrect - there's no document returned here - DocumentState::Deleted indicates that the item stored will have deleted=true.

Line:493, include/memcached/engine.h -> Can item be a reference here, given it must be non-null?

Line:158, tests/testapp/CMakeLists.txt -> I think these should be part of ep-enigne - i.e. move into engines/ep. That way one can run just the tests targeting ep-engine from that subdir.

will update soon and look also at updated arithmetic
Line:126, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> oops, pasted the comment in the wrong place

Line:477, include/memcached/engine.h -> true, just copied this comment from store above

Line:493, include/memcached/engine.h -> I think it can be
