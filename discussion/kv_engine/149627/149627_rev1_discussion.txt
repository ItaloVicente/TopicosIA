DESCRIPTION:

MB-45206: Log errno in Connection::event_callback

Even with BEV_OPT_DEFER_CALLBACKS (which is our default bufferevent
setting) the library ensures that errno is consistent with the event
passed in input to the user-defined callback (ie,
Connection::event_callback in our case).

That means that we can safely dump errno when we get a BEV_EVENT_ERROR
and trust what it reports.

See the libevent code for details.
