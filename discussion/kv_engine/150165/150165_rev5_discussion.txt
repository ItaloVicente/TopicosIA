DESCRIPTION:

MB-45236: Create multiple concurrent PagingVisitors

To improve eviction performance, distribute Vbids to multiple
PagingVisitors which may run at the same time.

Each vbucket will still be visited at most once, but more than one may
be visited at a time.

The number of PagingVisitors is bounded by the number of shards, and
half the number of NonIO threads.

If the number of tasks were >= the number of NonIO threads, under heavy
eviction PagingVisitors could starve other important tasks.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't think we should necessarily half from the number of shards - it just adds more complexity in terms of how much concurrency is available, and for heavy eviction / expiration workloads you could well want N shards worth of concurrency.

Going forwards the solution might be to increase the number of NonIO threads - especially for ethemeral where there's no reader/writer tasks using the threads R/W threads anyway.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> That does seem reasonable that we might want N shards worth of PVs, but the perf runs do suggest active streams/ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTasks are suffering with N paging visitors

More threads could definitely be a good solution, but even with that it still seems like #PV tasks < #Threads would be a "safer" situation, especially without task priority. The arbitrary N/2 is obviously not necessarily optimal either though!

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Note that with multiple buckets (e.g. 10) you'd potentially end up with many more PagingVisitors than threads to run them on - that's a totally expected scenario (we have the same with other tasks such as Flushers right now).

This might be a sign we _do_ need to add prioritisation back for FollyExecutorPool - but I feel it's too close to GA to try and mess around with that right now.

How many PagingVisitor tasks do we need to restore the regression - would 2 be sufficient?
