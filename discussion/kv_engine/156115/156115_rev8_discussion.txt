DESCRIPTION:

MB-42657: Write crash log messages to separate file

It is safe for the signal handler to use open/write/close, so to
enhance the current signal safe crash handler:

1) opens a new file "<logdir>/memcached.breakpad.crash.txt"
2) Dupe the stderr messages to the new file
3) On start-up check for the file and clone the contents to
the memcached.log

The result is that the memcached log is improved from the
prior state in that it will now contain a good indication
that a crash occurred (allowing existing tools which may
grep the logs to continue working).
