DESCRIPTION:

MB-42657: Write crash messages to new file

It is safe for the signal handler to use open/write/close.

This commit opens a new file "memcached.breakpad.crash.txt"
in the log directory when the signal handler is invoked.

The same messages which go to stderr will also go to this
file. When we startup we look for this file and if found
copy the content into the real memached.log and then
remove the file.

The outcome is that memcached log now includes a clear
message that a crash occurred.
