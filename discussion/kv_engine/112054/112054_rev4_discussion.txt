DESCRIPTION:

MB-35053: Extend allowedDuplicatePrepareSeqnos to highSeqno

When reconnecting, we can see duplicate prepares (when the intervening
commit has been deduped) *after* the hps, which were not previously
accepted by the PassiveDM. This is because the HPS is dependent on
persistence; PersistToMajority prepares "hold up" the HPS until they
have been persisted. BUT, we can still receive a duplicate for the
PersistToMaajority even if it has not been persisted.

   1           2                 3      4      5      6      7      8
 PRE(a) PRE(b, l=PersistToMaj) CMT(a) CMT(b) PRE(a) PRE(b) CMT(a) CMT(b)

If the replica received the following (but hasn't persisted anything
yet)

 PRE(a) PRE(b, l=PersistToMaj)
   ^
   |
  HPS = 1
then disconnected, and reconnected and saw

                                             PRE(a) PRE(b) CMT(a) CMT(b)

The replica has then seen a duplicate prepare that needs to replace the
prepare with seqno 2 - and 2 > HPS.

Therefore, the replica should permit duplicate prepares for any seqno
meeting the following:

HighCompletedSeqno < seqno <= highSeqno

No prepare prior to the HCS should be replaced, because they have been
completed - we have received a commit/abort for them.

Prepares with seqno > highSeqno are in the "future" - they were
received after the snapshot marker, and are not expected to be duped.
