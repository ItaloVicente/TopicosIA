DESCRIPTION:

MB-28370: Enable mem-tracking for DCPTest and stop negative mem_used

One of the DCP backfill tests began intermittently hanging after the
changes in 0739f2fd9. The test doesn't run with full memory tracking
and was relying only on the memOverhead changing. However in some
cases memOverhead had gone negative, resulting in a huge return
value from getEstimatedTotalMemory, resulting in the backfill being
suspended which is why the test hangs.

To fix:

1) Turn on full alloc/dealloc tracking when built with JEMALLOC so the
test can better track memory and avoid the backfill suspend.

2) Adjust getEstimatedTotalMemoryUsed so that with or without
memoryTrackingEnabled it doesn't try and return negative values
(which just become huge positive values).

2.1) Add tests for the negative cases
