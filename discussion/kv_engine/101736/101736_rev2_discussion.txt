I think you might have been overly aggressive in some of the headers removed...
Line:23, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> We use std::string here so this should include it (even if it's currently #including it "for free" via some earlier header).

Similar I think for some other includes here. What was your process for identifying unused headers?

Line:36, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Similar to previous comment, this file uses RelaxedAtomic so it should #include it.

Line:23, engines/ep/src/storeddockey.h -> Main process for identifying unused headers initially was"are they being used in this header file or its direct .cc? Also are they being used by the majority of the its includers?" I identified the headers to try and reduce looking at their occurences and compile time using ninja. But I agree that I probably got to aggressive with it when removing includes that we "get for free" as this will probably cause problems down the line.

I'll review the commit and make it less aggressive, then re-upload.
