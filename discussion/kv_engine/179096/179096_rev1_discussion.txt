DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Fix RangeScan sampling stats NotFound path

A previous fix added a bad line of logging that is accessing a
std::optional which may not be initialised if the stats read
fails.

Along with fixing that logging check for NotFound which is logically
the same as when the stats have an itemCount of 0.
