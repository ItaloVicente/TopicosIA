DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Rename dispatcher to network interface manager

Get rid of the "dispatcher thread" object and move the logic
into a new class called NetworkInterfaceManager which is a
better name for what it is responsible of doing. Currently
the event_handler is still stuck in memcached.cc as most
of the method it is calling is still located there.
