DESCRIPTION:

MB-46738: Simplify FlowControl locking mechanism

The FlowControl bufferSize and pendingControl members are strictly
related, as any change to the first requires the Consumer sending a
control message to the Producer for informing the latter of the new
FlowControl setup.

Here I replace the manual locking/unlocking and pair-updates of those
members with a folly::Synchronized<T>, where T is a class that embeds
the pair-updates internally. That makes the FlowControl state update
cleaner.
