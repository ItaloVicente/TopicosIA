DESCRIPTION:

MB-27963: Interlock compaction and initScanContext

Changes in MB-24292 made the file rev monotonic, it also removed some
speculative recovery code which basically when open failed just tried
to open any matching VBucket couch file.

In the new MB a first problem occurs in that compactDB and initScan
can race with each other, normally compactDB and say the flusher never
run concurrently because a higher level lock (vb_mutex) ensures only
compaction or flushing can run. However DCP backfill for example
issues a scan without that lock, it can interleave with compaction
allowing the scan code to read a file-rev from the dbFileRevMap then
by the time it hits sys_open compaction has removed the file and
changed the revision.

A second problem occurs when initScanContext fails openDB in that it
resets the dbFileRevMap entry to 1 (breaking the monoticity). This
results in further scan failures because the code tries for x.couch.1
rather than x.couch.20.

Fixes:

1. Make the dbFileRevMap an AtomicMonotonic so we can catch other
issues violating our monotonic requirement.

2. Interlock compaction and initScan using a read-write lock. The
change actually interlocks all openDB calls ensuring that compaction
cannot move the file in-between a read of the file-map and the call
to sys_open. The read-write lock ensures that concurrent flushes to
the shard are allowed, but compaction will block (the KVShard is
blocked) just whilst the map is updated.
