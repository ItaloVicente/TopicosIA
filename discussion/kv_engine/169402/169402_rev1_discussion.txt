DESCRIPTION:

MB-50492: Nexus ensure we call handleError in getDroppedCollections()

Ensure we call handleError() in NexusKVStore::getDroppedCollections() if
we find more dropped collections in the secondary KVStore compared to
the primary.

This patch also tidies up the creation of the error message and removes
redudant commented out code.
