DESCRIPTION:

MB-37150: Register cursor before backfilling after cursor dropping

Prior to this patch there was a small window of time after ActiveStream
checked the persisted seqno to determine if a backfill could provide
any items needed to catch up to the checkpoint manager _before_ the
cursor is reregistered.

In this window, closed checkpoints might be removed, or checkpoint
expelling might remove some items from the oldest checkpoint. Either of
these events would lead to the stream "skipping" some items; the cursor
would be registered at a later seqno than expected, and the stream does
not re-check whether a backfill is needed.

This patch makes ActiveStream register the cursor before trying to
schedule a backfill.

If the backfill end extends later than the requested seqno (an expected
situation) existing code in markDiskSnapshot "atomically" (under the
checkpoint manager lock) reregisters a cursor at the correct seqno.

Line:1057, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Ideally should get this test working if possible.

Line:1604, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Ditto

Line:2386, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Don't understand why this works - don't we need to force persistence so the Checkpoint can be removed (otherwise it's still referenced?)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2386, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Ahahah, this test isn't supposed to be committed - LALALA is an excellent, descriptive test name though :badpokerface:

This is from the "hacky look it does it" test which goes with the code in http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/119288/1/engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc

It needs refactoring to do it properly, but pushed what I had for Dan.

The whole test passes because it expects the correct behaviour, in the case where flushing and removal _do not_ run in the narrow window of danger.

That window now doesn't actually exist, so... thought needed
