DESCRIPTION:

MB-49040: 6/n Only check limits when limits are present

Avoid a scope map lookup + value compare if there are no limits
to check. This is done by counting

1) creations with a limit (increment)
2) drop with a limit (decrement)
3) modification (increment or decrement based on value)

Line:1168, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> key seems unused from here on, is this line needed for anything?

Line:1100, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/vbucket_manifest_test.cc -> I see that naming isn't easy, but something more descriptive than scope_with_limit_exists<N> would be nice :lol:

Line:1118, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/vbucket_manifest_test.cc -> eg this one sounds like ScopeWithLimitExists_ReplicaPromotion
