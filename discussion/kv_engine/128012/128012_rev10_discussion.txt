Line:452, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> as the previous ones...it should just return if no value

Line:513, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> this could probably be an else part to the check above (as if thats true we've already nuked all of the xattrs)

Line:452, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> Done

Line:513, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> So you're right, we could make the call to `removeUSerXattrs()` iff IncludeXattrs!=Yes, I had that in some of the previous patchsets.

But, one of the original reason for splitting this function in smaller bits was its complexity of multiple nested if-else conditions on the input-args. Also, adding the new IncludeDeletedUserXattrs has complicated things even more, so I would avoid to add-back extra checks and blocks, which turn out to be unnecessary (read below).

The reason for doing what you suggest would be avoiding an unnecessary call, but if we have already nuked all Xattrs, the call to `removeUSerXattrs()` will be a cheap no-op as it quickly returns.
Nota that by splitting this function in small/independent remove*() bits makes everything very flexible. For example, you may want to invert the order of any of the remove*() calls above: the logic doesn't (or at least it shouldn't) break and you can do that at no extra/relevant cost, as any subcall will quickly return if it "detects" a no-op.
