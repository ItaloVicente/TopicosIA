DESCRIPTION:

MB-45255: Skip backfillMgr update if null

There is a race condition on DcpProducer during bucket shutdown if a
new stream request arrives at the "wrong" time. This causes
DcpProducer::backfillMgr being dereferenced when it is null, resulting
in a segfault:

1. Start with 1 producer and an existing stream (so DcpProducer is not
   paused).
2. DcpProducer::streamRequest starts, succeeds but _doesn’t_ get as far
   as adding to DCP conn map.
3. DcpConnMap::closeStreams (due to bucket shutdown)
   1. closes all streams for each producer via
      DcpProducer::closeAllStreams
   2. which resets backfillMgr ptr.
4. DcpProducer::streamRequest continues; adds new stream into map.
5. DcpConnMap::disconnect called, calls DcpProducer::closeAllStreams
   again - which calls ActiveStream::setDead; attempts to dereference
   null backfillMgr ptr (if in backfilling state).

This is a similar issue to MB-37702 and MB-38521 - the difference
being exactly when the streamRequest occurs relative to
closeAllStreams.

The first attempt to fix this issue was by changing
DcpProducer::disconnect from a atomic bool to a
folly::Synchronized<bool>, which can be locked for a duration. We
could then acquire a read lock on DcpProducer::disconnect in the
prologue of DcpProducer::streamRequest, holding it until stream is
created to avoid the DcpProducer changing state partway through.

However, that introduced various lock inversions which were not
straightforward to solve - and addressing the first few significantly
increased the complexity of the fix which is undesirable this close to
7.0.

As such, the chosen solution is much simpler - check backfillMgr is
non-null before dereferencing it. In the case where a DcpProducer is
disconnecting and closing all it's streams, any backfillMgr buffer
updates are no lonnger relevent, so this is a valid solution.

code LGTM, comment looks to be wrong now
Line:520, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> this isn't true anymore

Line:25, /COMMIT_MSG -> At step 3 we call DcpProducer::closeAllStreams, which seems unnecessary if the same is executed at step 5 in the DcpConnMap::disconnect path.

So, is avoiding to call DcpProducer::closeAllStreams at 3 a correct alternative solution?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:25, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not really, because step 5 isn't necessarily guaranteed to happen in general - we get an explicit disconnect for this connection I believe because the client has closed it.
