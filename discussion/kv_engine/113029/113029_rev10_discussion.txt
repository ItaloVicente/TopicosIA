DESCRIPTION:

MB-35074: Fix mem_used tracking in get_collection_manifest

EventuallyPersistentEngine::get_collection_manifest calls a provided
response callback, which may grow a dynamic buffer as needed. The
buffer will later be free'd, and this deallocation will be tracked as
non-bucket.

Wrap the callback with makeExitBorderGuard to ensure the allocation is
not tracked against a bucket, never to be decremented.

Line:1311, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_test.cc -> Hmm, I think I mis-read what was happening here...

The intent of my comment was to verify your change works as expected - before your change there was a non-null engine set in TLS when the AddResponseFn was called, and after it is null.

Given EventuallyPersistentEngine::get_collection_manifest() acquires the engine (and releases it before returning), then setting / checking the current thread here (before EventuallyPersistentEngine::get_collection_manifest() is called isn't actually very useful.

Probably what you had originally was correct (i.e. just check the thread is null with the AddResponseFn callback).
