DESCRIPTION:

MB-35074: Fix mem_used tracking in get_collection_manifest

EventuallyPersistentEngine::get_collection_manifest calls a provided
response callback, which may grow a dynamic buffer as needed. The
buffer will later be free'd, aand this deallocation will be tracked as
non-bucket.

Ensure the potential allocation to grow the buffer is also tracked as
non-bucket to avoid "leaking" mem_used.
