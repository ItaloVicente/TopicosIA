DESCRIPTION:

MB-35074: Fix mem_used tracking in get_collection_manifest

EventuallyPersistentEngine::get_collection_manifest calls a provided
response callback, which may grow a dynamic buffer as needed. The
buffer will later be free'd, and this deallocation will be tracked as
non-bucket.

Wrap the callback with makeExitBorderGuard to ensure the allocation is
not tracked against a bucket, never to be decremented.
