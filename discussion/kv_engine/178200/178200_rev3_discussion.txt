DESCRIPTION:

Split serverless_test into ctest invocation per suite

The serverless_test program can be fairly slow, often over 1 minute on
TSan, and the program has an internal timeout of 2 minutes before which
it assumes that the underlying memcached instances may be stuck and it
kills them. Killing the memcached processes can upset TSan which will
warn about issues (in particular in the ProcessMonitor) that are a
result of the kill and are therefore misleading.

Split serverless_test into different suites when run under ctest so that
we're less likely to hit a timeout.

In a future change we should consider moving the timeout handling out of
the internal cluster and into ctest.
