DESCRIPTION:

Split serverless_test into ctest invocation per suite

The serverless_test program can be fairly slow, often over 1 minute on
TSan, so split it into different suites when run under ctest so that
it's less of an issue.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I'm not sure if I'm a huge fan of this.. Each serverless instance will start 3 sub memcached processes and create replication streams between all of the buckets. Will our builders run faster if the 4 serverless test groups all run in parallel (now trying to TSAN 12 different memcached processes in parallel).... and not make the system so slow that suddenly tests start to fail due to "overload"... 

There are a bunch of ep_testsuite tests which takes 3-4x the amount of time (each configuration) and we'd get more bang for the bucks by speeding up those..

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Data from one run:

Before:
14:58:39  425/426 Test #424: serverless_test .........................................................................................   Passed   64.44 sec
14:59:47  Total Test time (real) = 1048.41 sec

After:

424/429 Test #425: serverless_test.MiscTest ................................................................................   Passed   19.57 sec
14:45:17  425/429 Test #426: serverless_test.MeteringTest ............................................................................   Passed   21.41 sec
14:45:35  427/429 Test #427: serverless_test.ThrottleTest ............................................................................   Passed   29.69 sec
14:45:36  428/429 Test #424: serverless_test.DcpTest .................................................................................   Passed   43.30 sec
14:47:28  Total Test time (real) = 1092.65 sec

That is only from one run so it's not strictly representative.

I'm not too bothered about doing this, my goal wasn't to speed up overall execution, but to make each suite take less time. We were hitting an issue last week where the cluster was up for over 60 seconds and the ProcessMonitor killed it because it thought that it was stuck. I bumped the timeout to 2 minutes (https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/178097), but we probably don't want to keep doing that, and a change like this should make it harder to hit similar issues as we add more to serverless_test.

I'm happy to leave this as it is for now, and look into it again if/when we start hitting that 2 minute timeout.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Aha.. good to understand the reason behind it.. 

Now that you mention that timeout I recall why I added it ;-) That timeout was added because we didn't set a timeout in ctest for the cluster test.. it was just added as a quick hack to get the test to time out earlier (rather than hanging waiting for the overall build timeout to kick in)..

We could be more "creative" and monitor some stat on the underlying process and "push" the timeout as long as it looks like we're making progress.
