DESCRIPTION:

MB-35655: Make test more robust to handle spurious wakeups

Improve test DelVBucketConcurrentOperationsTest to allow it to handle
spurious wakeups by making sure it only calls delVBucket() when a
vbucket should exist.

Line:2333, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Prefer using the overload of wait() which takes a predicate - that makes it explicit what is being checked to avoid spurious wakeups.

Line:2336, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> This looks incorrect - you're modifying okToDelete without the mutex held. As such you could loose an update to it:

 T1: sets `okToDelete = true` (line 2319).
                 T2: delVBucket completes, sets `okToDelete = false` (line 2336).
                 T2: loops around and waits on `delWait` (line 2330).
 T1:Calls `delWait.notify_one()` (line 2320).
                 T2: wakes up and reads okToDelete (line 2331). Finds it is false and hence skips this wakeup.

Line:2377, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> This seems unrelated / unnecessary - it doesn't change the semantics of the test, just changes from 4 variables to a vector of 4 elements.
