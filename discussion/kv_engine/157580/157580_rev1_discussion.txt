DESCRIPTION:

MB-33784: Empty collection same flush optimization checks diskSize

We currently detect when we drop an empty collection so that we can
avoid triggering a purge (compaction) if there is meaningful work to
be done. An empty collection may exist in one of two scenarios:

1) The collection previously existed on disk and was dropped in some
   flush batch

2a) The collection was created and dropped in the same flush batch

Currently in scenario 2(a) we will persist only a drop collection system
event and the flush code will check the high seqno when processing
the collection data to determine if it should trigger a purge or not.
A highSeqno of 0 means nothing was written to the collection and no
purge is required.

With the changes being made under this MB to only perform flusher
dedupe for the storage backends that require it, a new scenario,
scenario 2(b) is introduced in which a collection is created and
dropped in the same flush batch, but the store persists both system
events. In this scenario the highSeqno check against 0 does not work
as it is set for the create system event.

Switch the check for scenario 2 from highSeqno to diskSize to
determine if the collection is empty.

Line:31, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'm not very keen on this - it feels like we are testing something indirect to determine it a collection has any items. For example; if we say later stopped tracking collection size (or made it optional?) then this would break.

Could we solve this in some other way? Perhaps looking at the state persisted to disk (non-zero collection high-seqno?) and comparing that with what we are about to flush?

Line:31, /COMMIT_MSG -> We could do a read of the stats beforehand (currently we only read them at warmup and write in each flush) to compare that. It's extra (potentially - if we don't hit buffer cache) disk work though. I could add just add an "itemInBatch" bool to the stats tracking (transient) and use that instead

Line:31, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks. itemInBatch seems simple and directly related to the work at hand - if that works I think that's better than disk size 👍
