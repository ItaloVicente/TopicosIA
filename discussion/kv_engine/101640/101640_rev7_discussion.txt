DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Remove isReplication flag and instead rely on vbucket state

We pass the isReplication flag through EventuallyPersistentEngine ->
KVBucket -> VBucket to determine the threshold for deciding whether
there is sufficient memory to allocate a StoredValue, (see
VBucket::hasMemoryForStoredValue)  The flag selects a different
threshold depending on whether we are allocating items received via a
passive stream or not.

Given that the destination of a passive stream cannot be an active
bucket (see DcpConsumer::addStream), in most cases basing the decision
on whether the vbucket is a replica or not, is equivalent.

There are two exceptions:

1) EPDiskRollbackCB::callback and EPBucket::rollbackUnpersistedItems use
setFromInternal, which use the non-replica threshold.

2) During warmup when items are added to replica buckets it uses the
non-replica threshold.

To support these two exceptions an override flag is added to
VBucket::hasMemoryForStoredValue.

General approach looks good, couple of minor comments.
Line:1487, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> What about pending?

Line:2183, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I think this name is a little ambiguous - it's probably better named something like "assumeStateisActive" or "useActiveVBucketMemThreshold".

Line:1546, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Prefer using a new, strongly-typed enum (e.g. IncludeValue::No / Yes) to make it explicit to the reader what this refers to.

Line:1487, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Yes agreed, good spot.
If we know we need if came from active then better to change to
getState == vbucket_state_active.

Also make change to the hasMemoryForStoredValue function.

Line:2183, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Changed to UseActiveVBMemThreshold.

Also changed to getState == vbucket_state_active (to cover the case of pending vbuckets) which will getting their items from a passive stream.

Line:1546, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Done
