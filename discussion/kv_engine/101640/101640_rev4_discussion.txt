DESCRIPTION:

Remove isReplication flag and instead rely on vbucket state

We pass the isReplication flag through EventuallyPersistentEngine ->
KVBucket -> VBucket to determine the threshold for deciding whether
there is sufficient memory to allocate a StoredValue, (see
VBucket::hasMemoryForStoredValue)  The flag selects a different
threshold depending on whether we are allocating items received via a
passive stream or not.

Given that the destination of a passive stream cannot be an active
bucket (see DcpConsumer::addStream), in most cases basing the decision
on whether the vbucket is a replica or not, is equivalent.

There are two excpeptions:

1) The RollbackCB uses setFromInternal, and although it is storing data
recieved from a passive stream it uses the non-replica threshold.  The
patch changes this to use the replica threshold.

2) During warmup when items are added to replica buckets it uses the
non-replia threshold.  As the data is not received from a replication
stream, this is left unchanged.
