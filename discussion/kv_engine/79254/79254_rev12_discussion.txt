DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: CacheCallback to not directly access HashTable object

The hash table object should ideally be a protected member of the
VBucket class, as opposed to being public.

The patch moves towards this goal by introducing a getItem function to
the VBucket class, which ensures that the backfill function
CacheCallback::callback no longer requires direct access to the hash
table object.

Tests to ensure the refactor does not change functionality were added
in the following patch http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/78650/

Line:65, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> This seems like an abuse of the diskDeleteAll flag, which is intended to be used during bucket flush.

Given you're not setting GET_DELETED_VALUE, it shouldn't be necessary to set this.

Line:85, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> Style: Don't use `else` after a change in control-flow - https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst

Line:579, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> This seems incorrect - you are unconditionally doing a bgFetch even though get_options_t may have it specified.

If you want to make bgFetch() be unconditional, then that's (possibly) ok, but yo should remove passing `options` into here.

Line:1552, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Minor nit: pretty long variable name - maybe abbreviate to `bgFetchRequired`?

Line:65, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> removed the comment, and set diskFlushAll to false.

Line:85, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> removed the else

Line:579, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> The only call to getInternalNonResident is from VBucket::getInternal.
And the flags are checked prior to making the call.  So can be removed from inside the getInternalNonResident function.

Line:1552, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Done
