DESCRIPTION:

Move numTotalItems from HashTable -> VBucket

In Full-Eviction, items may exist in a VBucket without being in the
HashTable, as they may have been fully evicted. As such, numTotalItems
is not a property of the HashTable, it is a property of the VBucket.

Therefore move numTotalItems from HashTable to VBucket, to better
encapsulate the VBucket's state.
