DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: CacheCallback to not directly access HashTable object Ver. 2

The hash table object should ideally be a protected member of the
VBucket class, as opposed to being public.

The patch moves towards this goal by introducing a getItem function to
the VBucket class, which ensures that the backfill function
CacheCallback::callback no longer requires direct access to the hash
table object.

Tests to ensure the refactor does not change functionality were added
in the following patch http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/78650/

Note: This patch performs the same refactoring to one that has already
been merged.  However it was found to have a bug and therefore was
reverted.  The bug was that it was thought that
EPVBucket::getInternalNonResident would only be called with
QUEUE_BG_FETCH set as an option however, this was found not to be the
case.  CacheCallback::callback, which utlimately calls
EPVBucket::getInternalNonResident, does not set the option.  In this
case we want EPVBucket::getInternalNonResident to return
ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK.

For original refactor see:
 - Change-Id: I2c71dd30f6b8c66de668137cac1bf358bbdf6588
For the revert of the refactor see:
 - Change-Id: I5dc4e7dad4bb4a91ff94eb7509499ec8f62874b5

In addition to addressing the bug found in the original patch, this
version has an additional regression test to protect from the bug being
re-introduced.

Line:590, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> I'm not sure I see what his was removed - it still seems like a valid check to make. 

I can see there's arguments for returning something other than ENGINE_SUCCESS here (throwing std::invalid_argument might be a good choice), but I don't think the check should be removed entirely...

Line:590, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Have made it an invalid_argument - as we explicitly guard that it the ALLOW_META_ONLY option is not set before making the call into getInternalNonResident.
