DESCRIPTION:

MB-35314: Only negotiate SyncRepl if consumer has consumerName

ns_server will only create a consumer DCP connection with a
consumerName when the cluster is fully MadHatter+ and supports
SyncReplication. Currently the consumer code attempts to negotiate
SyncReplication with the producer node regardless of whether or not
it has a consumerName. It is only valid for the consumer node to
negotiate SyncReplication when it has a consumerName as the producer
needs to have received a replication topology. This is sent by
ns_server before we open DCP connections with consumerNames.

The current code causes rebalance failures due to lack of topology on
the active node as the consumer allows a seqnoAck to be sent as it
thinks that SyncReplication is enabled and so does the producer.

Line:198, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Style: Personally I'd use a ternary for this as IMHO it's simpler and shorter:

syncReplNegotiation.state = pendingSendConsumerName
                                    ? SyncReplNegotiation::State::PendingRequest
                                    : SyncReplNegotiation::State::Completed;

Line:1008, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> That's probably going to tear the connection down (IIRC anything non-SUCCESS does). I _think_ that's ok (it is an unexpected situation), but just wanted to make you aware if you weren't already...

Line:125, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_dcp_consumer.h -> Given you have this accessor in the mock; why do we need to change the visibility of the member in DcpConsumer from protected to public?

Line:1008, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Yup. Figured this was better than throwing due to null topology then tearing down anyway as it's more explicit
