DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Simplify mcbp_write_and_free logic

Previously we set the connections write.curr and size
to point to a different buffer so that we could add it
to the iovector in a different task. It is easier to
add them to the iovector initially, and then jump to
the write task.

It looks like the separation between the conn_write and
conn_mwrite task is slowly becoming obsolete and could
be replaced with a single task.
