DESCRIPTION:

MB-27640: Updates to mc_time_test to fix sporadic failure

The tests basically assume now is 0, which often is when the test runs
quickly.

However if McTimeTest::Setup is delayed or Setup crossed a 1 second tick,
two tests can fail.

This commit fixes those two tests by accounting for now.
