DESCRIPTION:

MB-37772: Refactor ScanContext ready for by-seqno/by-id scans

Create a class hierarchy in ScanContext so that we can create
BySeqnoScan and ById scan objects, with common data/code pushed
to the base-class ScanContext.

With this patch, only ScanContext and BySeqnoScanContext are
added.
