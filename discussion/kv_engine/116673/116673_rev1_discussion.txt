DESCRIPTION:

WIP: keep couchstore files open across writes

Currently CouchKVStore opens and closed the underlying couchstore file
on every call to saveDocs(). Profiling has highlighted that the
underlying OS close() call (and to a lesser extent the open() call)
are costly - on Linux with XFS there appears to be non-trivial work to
release various allocated resources - cklose() takes around 7% of the
total flusher runtime.

To improve this, keep the couchstore Db instance for each vBucket open
across calls. This increases KV-Engine's FD usage (potentially 1024
more FDs open at once than before), but should reduce these costs.

TODO: Interlock compaction more strictly. We _should_ be safe at the
moment as external locking is used to obtain mutual exclusion between
flushing and compaction, however that seems error-prone given we
should be avble to go that inside CouchKVStore.
