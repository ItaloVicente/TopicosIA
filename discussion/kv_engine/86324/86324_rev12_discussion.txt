DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: [5/N] Implement Tagged Pointer for SingleThreadRCPtr

This patch introduces a SingleThreadedRCTaggedPtr class, which combines
the reference count properties of a SingleThreadedRCPtr with the tagging
properties of the TaggedPtr class, which holds 16-bits of user data as
well as acting as a pointer.

Line:144, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> Don't understand why this was changed back to returning a pointer - it's not valid to call a member function on a null object; hence if you can call this you must have a concrete object.

Line:245, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> Please update the comment to describe the new parameters (note you can use @tparam in Doxygen for template params).

Line:256, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> Given you repeat this a few places I suggest you add a type alias for it.

Line:266, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> Do you want to be able to assign from different deleters? I suspect that might be dangerous - suggest you make the third parameter (D) be the same as the class (Deleter).

Line:156, engines/ep/src/blob.h -> I don't think you should need this - the default of (std::default_delete) should be fine.

Line:34, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> If you default the Deleter template parameter in the declaration, you don't need to repeat it here (nor should you need to #include <memory>).

Line:43, engines/ep/src/single_threaded_rc_tagged_ptr.h -> I think you should be able to share this with how TaggedUniquePtr works - i.e. the whole point of making STRCPtr behave like the standard pointer types is we don't need to define all this again.

In other words, both TaggedUniquePtr and TaggedSingleThreadedRCPtr should be just two different instantiations of a TaggedPtr template class (I think!).

Line:144, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> need to change for the following test, where the pointer was null.

/// Test setTag and getTag of SingleThreadedPtr
TEST(SingleThreadedPtrTest, setTagTest) {
    SingleThreadedPtr taggedPtr(nullptr);
    taggedPtr.setTag(123);
    EXPECT_EQ(123, taggedPtr.getTag());
}

However in latest patch have removed the wrapper SingleThreadedPtr class (and associated tests) so have reverted back to a reference.

Line:245, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> Done - thanks for the note about @tparam - I did not know about that.

Line:256, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> Done

Line:266, engines/ep/src/atomic.h -> Done

Line:156, engines/ep/src/blob.h -> No longer have as deleted wrapper class.

Line:34, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> If I define the template (line 31) as follows:
template <class T, class Pointer, class Deleter=std::default_delete<T>>

it complains with the following error:
error: template parameter redefines default argument

However if I leave as template <class T, class Pointer, class Deleter> but change
using queued_item = SingleThreadedRCPtr<Item, Item*>. i..e don't have a 3rd template parameter it complains with:

error: too few template arguments for class template 'SingleThreadedRCPtr'

If I try using queued_item = SingleThreadedRCPtr<Item, Item*, Deleter>;

It complains with
error: use of undeclared identifier 'Deleter'; did you mean 'delete'?

Hence I ended up having to provide the std::default<Item>

Line:43, engines/ep/src/single_threaded_rc_tagged_ptr.h -> As discussed have removed the wrapper class.
