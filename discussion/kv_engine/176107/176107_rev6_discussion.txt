DESCRIPTION:

MB-49641 Add config for Magma's memory optimised write

Enable it only for serverless where it is actually needed to reduce
memory consumption at the cost of increased flush times.

In future we'll do some memory quota tuning so that it is triggered less
often and do some enhancements to reduce the frontend write times.
