DESCRIPTION:

MB-49641 Add config for Magma's memory optimised write

Enable it only for serverless where it is actually needed to reduce
memory consumption at the cost of increased flush times.

In future we'll do some memory quota tuning so that it is triggered less
often and do some enhancements to reduce the frontend write times.

Line:274, engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore_config.h -> This feels slightly misleading, given this doesn't do anything different *unless* the memtable memory limit is reached, which I would assume should not happen in steady-state (Magma should be pre-emptively flushing memtables before memory limit is hit?)
