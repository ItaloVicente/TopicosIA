DESCRIPTION:

Push active user list

Push the active users list to the external authentication
providers at a configurable interval. This allows the
external authentication provider to check with LDAP to
see if the users credential has changed.

The interval is specified in seconds and may be changed
dynamically by using the configuration paramater named:
active_external_users_push_interval

Yes, but if memcached uses polling for authorization ns_server doesn't need to monitor active users anymore, right?

In other words: Instead of having two commands PushActiveList (from mcd to ns_server) and UserPermissionUpdate (from ns_server to mcd) we can have only one called GetPermissions (from mcd to ns_server). Since we decided to send updates for every user every time it will have the same functionality with less messages and simpler protocol.
