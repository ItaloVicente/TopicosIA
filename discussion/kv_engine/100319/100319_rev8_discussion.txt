DESCRIPTION:

Push active user list

Push the active users list to the external authentication
providers at a configurable interval. This allows the
external authentication provider to check with LDAP to
see if the users credential has changed.

The interval is specified in seconds and may be changed
dynamically by using the configuration paramater named:
active_external_users_push_interval

Line:113, daemon/external_auth_manager_thread.cc -> What happens if the state machine is in the middle of an existing command? Is that possible?

Should we be asserting what the current state is?

Line:215, daemon/external_auth_manager_thread.cc -> This means we'll wait for activeUsersPushInterval before ever sending the first active users to ns_server. Is that desirable? Would be better if we sent it immediately when we start, and then every 5mins after?

Line:2156, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> nit: are

Line:2169, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> ? Is this correct ?

Line:113, daemon/external_auth_manager_thread.cc -> It won't happen at that time. This is injected into the list of commands to be run at a later time. And the state machine picks these up only when it is safe to do so.

Line:2169, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> Done

Line:113, daemon/external_auth_manager_thread.cc -> We can, but we don't do that anywhere else in the code where we set the next state so I don't really see why we should start doing it here?

Line:113, daemon/external_auth_manager_thread.cc -> Well, everywhere else we only change the state from one of the state functions themselves. Here we have a background task (correct me if I'm wrong) "forcing" the stateMachine to a particular value.

I'm just thinking about catching bugs (given the server-initiated stuff is new) - if we expect that this only happens when a Connection is in a given state; surely it makes sense to assert that - and fail explicitly instead of say silently discarding a user operation?

Line:113, daemon/external_auth_manager_thread.cc -> This method _IS_ called from directly from the state machinery when we enter the waiting state, or when we enter the read packet header.

It is called in the worker threads context as the normal iteration in the state machinery.

Line:113, daemon/external_auth_manager_thread.cc -> Hmm ok - but it still kinda feels complex that we have "side" ServerEvents perturbing the state machine - would it not be simpler if execute() had a stricter API where it is not allowed to change the state; it simply produces some data; and the state machine movement is handled by statemachine.cc ?

I just worry that once we have multiple ServerEvents, each bouncing the stateMachine from one place to another we potentially have bugs where states are missed - hence asking we make explicit our assumption about what state(s) we are already in here (Looks like conn_read_packet || conn_waiting currently?)

Line:113, daemon/external_auth_manager_thread.cc -> We already have multiple server events... CCCP push notifications is another one, Authenticate requests is one.. if we add multiple events to the same connection they're processed one by one (jumping all the way back to runEventloop for each one of them and calling the next state.. if the event don't produce any data the state will never change etc).

Line:215, daemon/external_auth_manager_thread.cc -> When we start the list would always be empty so I don't really see the point of that..

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:113, daemon/external_auth_manager_thread.cc -> Ok - so can we assert we are in a specific state here then (before we call setState)?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:215, daemon/external_auth_manager_thread.cc -> Ok fine - just wondered if it would be useful to immediately poke ns_server with the list.
