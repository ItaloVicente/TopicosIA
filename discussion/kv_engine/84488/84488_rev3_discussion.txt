-1 just for the unrelated change - given the size / breath of this patch I think it would be best if it just felt with the enum class refactor (and didn't change any behaviour).
Line:1060, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> This change seems unrelated to the type refactoring - can it be moved into a separate patch?

Line:26, daemon/statemachine_mcbp.h -> You might be interested in a approach using std::variant / boost::variant for encoding state machines - there's a couple of versions of it, for example: http://khuttun.github.io/2017/02/04/implementing-state-machines-with-std-variant.html

This encodes the possible state transitions and adds compile-time checks that all states are covered.

Note: Not suggesting you *have* to adopt this in this patch; but thought be of interest to you :)

Line:41, daemon/statemachine_mcbp.h -> Given you have to touch all the lines of code which use these names anyway; I'd suggest also updating to the correct naming convention at the same time (NewCmd, Waiting, etc).
