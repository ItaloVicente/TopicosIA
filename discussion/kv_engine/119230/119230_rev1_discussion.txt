DESCRIPTION:

MB-37096: Debug CRT: avoid invalid iter comparisons

As seen when runing with Windows Debug runtime,
CheckpointManager::resetCursors() compares an interator pointing to the
old checkpointList (cit.second->currentCheckpoint) with an iterator from
the new checkpointList - note that the caller
(CheckpointManager::clear_UNLOCKED) has swapped the checkpointList with
an empty one.

Comparing iterators from different containers is technically UB (it's
probably fine in most implementations). Fix by skipping the comparison -
it's not functionally necessary.
