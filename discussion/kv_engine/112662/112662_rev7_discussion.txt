DESCRIPTION:

MB-35367: Remove potential race in seqno acking

From code inspection, looks like we could enter either the
PDM::notifySnapshotEndReceived or PDM::notifyLocalPersistence
functions and acquire a hps value to ack back to the active.
The locking ensures that we never attempt to ack the same value
twice, but if the first thread were to reach the check if
hps != prevHps and get deschdeduled then a second thread could
make it through the lock and ack a high value before the first.
This would cause the active to throw monotonic invariant broken
exceptions.

Line:263, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Ignore me - I'm wrong here. We need to hold /some/ lock while calling sendSeqnoAck() to ensure two different threads are serialised - otherwise they could both unlock at line 259 then execute 261 in the wrong order.
