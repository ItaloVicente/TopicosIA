DESCRIPTION:

MB-27106 [RocksDB] Flush the 'local' CF after rocksdb::DB::Write

All the Column Families share the WAL. When the Memtable for a single CF
is flushed, a new WAL is created. But, the old WAL cannot be deleted if
it contains live data from one or more other CFs.
As the 'local' Column Family is written less than other CFs, live data
on the 'local' Memtable may prevent old WALs from being deleted.
