DESCRIPTION:

MB-39113: Ensure we don't crash if we purge a lower seqno seen before

Ensure we don't crash due to a monotonic exception being thrown. This
exception is caused when we self assign highestPurgedDeletedSeqno to
its self during BasicLinkedList::purgeListElem(), when we purge an item
which has a seqno less than its current value. This is a valid situation
that may occur when items with lower seqno are marked as deleted between
purges. To fix this ensure we only update the value of
highestPurgedDeletedSeqno when the item we're purging is greater than
its current value.

I haven't tested it pre-Cheshire-Cat, but as the code has not changed for 3 years would expect so. Though I wouldn't expect to a crash in production given its the fact is a monotonic and shouldn't throw in a production build. We also don't use highestPurgedDeletedSeqno for anything more than the to stream function for linked-list.

Ok, thanks. Could you add that comment to the MB please?

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit itself

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> "marked as stale" here? Items can't become deleted while keeping the same seqno, but they will become stale after the purge interval.
