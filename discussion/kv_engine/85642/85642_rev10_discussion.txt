DESCRIPTION:

MB-26110: Add compaction failure count to KVStore stats

To help with auto-failover of disk issues, we want to add a statistic
for compaction failures.  This is provided on a per shard basis similar
to other KVStore stats.

A subseqent patch will provide an aggregate of this and other KVStore
stats for use by ns_server.

Line:1106, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> You probably don't want / need this - you're not testing the logging of couchstore in this test, just that the failure_compaction stat increases correctly.
