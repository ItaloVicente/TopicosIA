DESCRIPTION:

MB-49858: Compaction throttle: account for #writer threads

When scheduling a compaction, if too many compaction tasks are already
running we snooze the new task instead of running it immediately. This
is done by comparing the number of compaction tasks to the shard
count, and only allowing up to half of the shard count compaction
tasks to run concurrently.

The intent here is that the shard count represents the maximum number
of concurrent Writer tasks (flushing or compaction); hence we want to
'reserve' half of the available slots for non-compaction tasks.

However the current logic is flawed as the number of runnable
Compaction / Flusher tasks also depends on how many Writer threads
exist - if there are 16 shards but only 4 writer threads, then only 4
Writer tasks can run at once - and by the current logic one could
consume all available Writer threads if 4 vBuckets were requested to
be compacted at once.

Before v6.5.0 this was less of an issue, as the default number of
shards was 4 and the default number of Writer threads was also
4. Changing either required either a restart (num_shards) or a
diag/eval (num writer threads).

However from 6.5.0 onwards the defaults have changed:

- Default shard count is #logical_CPU_cores (typically much higher
  than 4).

- Default writer thread count is still 4 (however it can easily be
  changed from the UI without restarting)

As such, out-of-the-box on a typical system (16+ cores); the number of
shards will be 4 and num_writers will be 16. The existing throttle
calculation would not kick in into the 9th compaction task; well in
excess of the maximum concurrent tasks which can be run, and flushing
throughput can be impacted significantly.

Address this by including the writer thread count in the calculation,
so we base the cap on how many tasks can _actually_ run for the given
Bucket.
