DESCRIPTION:

MB-46890: Generate the list of enabled audits

The list of the enabled audit events gets built up at runtime
by using the "compiled in" default values and allow to override
them in the "event_states" in the configuration.

Currently we try to generate the "new" audit filter by converting
the config into the new config and as part of the refactor the
"compiled in" enabled events got lost (and there was no unit
test to verify that). This patch adds that back (with a test)
