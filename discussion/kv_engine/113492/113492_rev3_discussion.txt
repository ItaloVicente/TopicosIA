DESCRIPTION:

MB-34017: Correct Disk snapshot marker to not send 0 value

A Disk snapshot will now send a HCS value from the active node to
the replica node. This value could be 0 if no SyncWrites have been
completed. If this is the case, we should not send a 0 HCS as there
is no need and it will cause a pre-condition to fail in the flusher
on the replica.
