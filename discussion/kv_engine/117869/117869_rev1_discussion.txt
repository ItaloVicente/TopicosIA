DESCRIPTION:

MB-36765: Revert "MB-35308: Move HPS on non durable writes"

This reverts commit 1dcdf61e860ea8c18cb75144b049e0104ef31ef9.

Moving the HighPreparedSeqno (HPS) on non-durable writes introduced a
perf regression in non-durable workloads.

Reverting this patch restores the previous behaviour of moving the HPS
only when a Prepare becomes locally satisfied (e.g., a
PersistToMajority prepare is persisted).

This resolves the perf regression without breaking correctness.
ns_server will check both the HPS and HighSeqno to determine which
replica to promote as the HPS alone will no longer be sufficient.

Revert looks good.

There's a few TODOs which have been re-introduced in test code (relating to moving HPS with non-SyncWrites). Can you upload a follow-up patch which tidies them up? (I think keeping this patch just the straight revert minimises any confusion / risk of introducing bugs etc).

In particular, MB-36133 will now need to be addressed in a different way
