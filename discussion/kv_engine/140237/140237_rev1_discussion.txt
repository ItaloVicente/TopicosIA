Line:8471, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> sorry for the formatting change, accidentally clang formatted the whole file again I but put it back to this

Line:396, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> Sizes have changed and memory tracking is a touch different in the checkpoint manager, so this needed bumping up.

Still reviewing, but as an aside I wouldn't have (a) merged three big patches in one go and (b) changed how the memory tracking was implemented (the RAII guard) as part of the merge - you generally want to make it as easy as possible for a human to review (i.e. the "auto-merge" diff should ideally be as small as possible...)

Yeah 3 in one go was definitely not the way to go. Forgot quite how different it would need to be in mad-hatter

If it's not too problematic I'd really suggest breaking this into multiple merges given the number of changes / conflicts...
Line:1455, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I believe we got rid of the `force` flag in mad-hatter as it was no longer used - what's the reason for resurrecting it?

My general approach is to attempt the merge of all outstanding commits, if that merges without conflict then super, if not I gradually reduce how many commits until I either don't get any conflicts or am down to a single commit.

That makes it much easier for both the author and reviewer(s) to verify the merge is correct - they either have no conflicts to look at, or the conflicts are always within the scope of a single original patch.
