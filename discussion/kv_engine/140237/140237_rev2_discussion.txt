DESCRIPTION:

Merge branch 'couchbase/alice' into mad-hatter

Note: Due to changes in the CheckpointManager memory tracking between
alice and mad-hatter, checks in ReplicaMemoryTrackingStateChange have
been temporarily weakened, and will be restored in a later patch.

* commit '69730e6f4':
  MB-41804: Use 'Pagable' mem_used & watermark

Nothing blocking, but I would like the `force` stuff removed ultimately. If you don't remove it as part of this patch can you please make a note to raise a follow up?
Line:220, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Note (for future patch): we could move the stats.coreLocal updates out of here and into the callback.

Line:1455, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> force still here..

Line:380, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Note: force still here...

Line:31, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_bucket.cc -> Nit: this isn't a system or external library header, should be "checkpoint_manager.h"

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:380, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Would prefer to remove it in a follow up IIRC it was _added_ back in by the merged change (might not be clear because of the checkpoint.h->checkpoint_manager.h code move) and removing it would involve changing the tests to not need it (probably _relatively_ straight forward, probably storing a dummy item rather than forcing an empty ckpt to be closed)
