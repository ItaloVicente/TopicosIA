DESCRIPTION:

MB-40531: Prefer paging from replicas if possible

Prior to this change, the pager would try to page out X% of items in
replica vbuckets, but if this did not bring memory usage below the low
water mark, it would flip phase to ACTIVE_AND_PENDING_ONLY - meaning
the next run of the pager would page immediately try to page from
active and pending vbuckets.

Now, active/pending vbuckets will only be considered if paging _every_
possible item from replicas would not free enough memory to drop below
the low water mark.

Line:158, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Might be worth a brief explanation on why replicas cannot page any memory out.

Line:1241, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> We already have one friend for test / benchmarking (see line 1422). Can we just have the one class which is a friend of this?

Also, what's the specific reason for adding friendship? Might be preferable to add some regular method(s) which expose the info you need...

Line:141, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> Style: Please use `const` on variables which don't change after initial assignment.

Line:62, engines/ep/src/item_pager.h -> Nit: prefer 0.0 initialisers for double values, less of an issue here given one can see the type is double, but it's a useful hint elsewhere that one is dealign with a floating-point type.

Line:75, engines/ep/src/paging_visitor.cc -> Let's take this out as part of this patch - I don't think we construct it in more than a couple of places.

Line:101, engines/ep/src/paging_visitor.cc -> const

Line:364, engines/ep/src/paging_visitor.cc -> Remind me if this even makes sense anymore - doesn't it just mess with our carefully-calculated percentages? :)

Line:27, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hash_table_utils.h -> given generateFreqValue is logically const I see no reason we can't just make it public and avoid the need for this class.

Line:890, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> Suggest we increase this to at least 2 vBuckets of each type, to test that the RR of each replica (and active) vBucket is (roughly) the same.

Line:917, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> Please document / explain the magic 1.1

Line:1055, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> This isn't constrained enough - we should check active is still over some reasonable amount - 50% or greater...
