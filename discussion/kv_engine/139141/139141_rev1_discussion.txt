DESCRIPTION:

MB-39283: Provide CouchRequest pointers to couchstore at commit

With this change KV starts using the new couchstore API at commit.
The path is not complete yet. In a follow-up we will start using the
CouchRequest pointers in each call to saveDocsCallback in KV, which will
logically remove the usage of kvstats_ctx::keyStats.
