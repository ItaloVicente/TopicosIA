DESCRIPTION:

WIP: MB-52357: Create a per-thread audit filter cache

Previously all of the enabled audit events would look at
the list of filtered users by the thread writing them to
disk.

This patch allows for checking the filter _before_
submitting the event to the audit daemon and hence
remove any lock contention and resource consumption
we had by always trying to submit the events to the
central queue
