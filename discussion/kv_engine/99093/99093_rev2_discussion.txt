DESCRIPTION:

MB-30552: Convert type of vBucket id's from uint16_t to Vbid [2/n]

(Stage 2 of n) This commit changes to the type of Vbid inside a
collection of dcp files. This allows greater control over what
operations can be performed on a vBucket id, as well as ensuring
the output formatting is consistent. To support the splitting of
this into multiple stages, Vbid can currently be implicitly
converted back to uint16_t to cover elements that have not yet
been converted. During this, there may be logs or prints with
"vb:vb:", which should be fixed within this set of changes.
