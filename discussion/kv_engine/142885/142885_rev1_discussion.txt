DESCRIPTION:

MB-43121: Disable concurrent compaction and flushing

It turns out that the task wasn't as simple as first anticipated
(relying on the nature of the couchstore file with its headers).
First we found the problem with rollback which we solved by
aborting the compaction. This wasn't hard as it was called
in a context where it held the vbuckets lock.

MB-43121 is caused by receiving a del-vbucket call which obtains
the vbucket lock then set the state to dead before it schedules
an asynchronous delete of the actual vbucket (which again runs
without the lock held).

We need some sort of "manager" in our system to keep track of all
these state changes in a centeral place instead of spreading the
logic all over the place (we need the same sort of logic for magma,
RocksDB and the next big thing).

Disable the functionality to avoid hitting bug by bug caused by
other locations we didn't think of where this could be an issue.
