DESCRIPTION:

MB-49542: Ensure OSO backfill does not register cursor for dead stream

ActiveStream removes any associated cursor when transitioning to dead.
After this, the stream should never again have a cursor registered, as
it will not be cleaned up when the stream is destroyed.

Backfills may attempt to re-register a cursor. Seqno ordered backfills
already checked that the stream is in the correct state; OSO backfills
lacked this check.

As a result, creating a stream, starting an OSO backfill, then ending
the stream could lead to the backfill task registering a cursor for a
dead stream.

This cursor would then linger forever; no stream would clean it up, and
cursor dropping would never remove it as that code path calls through
DcpProducer to find the matching stream - and there is no matching
stream.

Line:128, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/collections_oso_dcp_test.cc -> can't we just do ensureDcpWillBackfill();? Instead of doing a full warmup?
