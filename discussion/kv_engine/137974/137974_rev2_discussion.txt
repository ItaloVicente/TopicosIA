DESCRIPTION:

MB-39505: Simplify associating StatCollectors with a bucket/scope/col

Relying on the caller to correctly set a label with a key "bucket",
"scope" or "collection" leaves open the possibility of forgetting to do
so, making a typo, etc.

As the only labels which are currently required are bucket, scope, and
collection, simplify the interface to

 forBucket(bucket)
 forScope(scopeID)
 forCollection(collectionID)

This ensures consistency in both the label keys, and the formatting of
the values - scope and collections will both always be formatted
correctly, with no chance for accidentally providing a name instead,
for example.

By introducing different types {Bucket,Scope,Col}StatCollector (as
thin wrappers around a "real" StatCollector) methods can declare which
labels they require. I.e., for a method

addFooCollectionsStats(ColStatCollector& collector);

The caller _must_ have added bucket, scope, and collection labels to
have created a suitable collector to pass as a parameter.

Line:24, engines/ep/src/configuration.cc -> Do we need this and "statistics/collector.h"?
Also - why is one using "" and the other <> ?

Line:160, include/statistics/collector.h -> This sentence doesn't make a lot of sense to me. If you're referring to the object itself, then if it doesn't change anything when why isn't this method const?

Line:24, engines/ep/src/configuration.cc -> Don't need both and possibly the "statistics/collector.h" was a find/replace when it first moved out to statistics :shrug:. CLion folding only _some_ of includes around the ifdefs makes it easy to miss

Removed the one below.

Line:160, include/statistics/collector.h -> IIRC it's not const because the BucketStatCollector needed a non-const reference, and it needed a non-const reference to call non-const addStat, which was non-const because PrometheusStatCollector did non-const things in its implementation of addStat.

Flipping that all round, I'm going to make PrometheusStatCollector _not_ do non-const things, and slide const all the way back up to here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:160, include/statistics/collector.h -> Rather than some fun rebasing I've added the const-ness changes in a later patch instead, and removed this sentence there.
