DESCRIPTION:

MB-28633: Don't create a temp std::string in ScanContext::manageSeparator

When creating a DocKey (which is just a view on the underlying data)
in ScanContext::manageSeparator(), don't create a temporary
std::string. This is illegal as when the string goes out of scope
(after calling DocKey::make() at line 34) the resulting 'cKey2' will
be pointing at how-freed stack.
