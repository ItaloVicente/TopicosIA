DESCRIPTION:

Account for non-zero initial mem_usage in DCP test

As part of this test, items are written until a new open checkpoint is
created when `vb_0:mem_usage >= ep_checkpoint_max_size`.

Previously, we didn't account for the initial mem_usage before items
were added, which could cause test failure by making an item that
should've been in the current checkpoint "overflow" into the next.
