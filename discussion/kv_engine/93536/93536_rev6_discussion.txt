DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Wrap hdr_histogram in its own class

Wraps the hdr_histogram data structure in its own class (HdrHistogram)
thereby making it possible to use (for example to hold statistics)
without needing to refer directly to the underlying C data structure.

Line:49, engines/ep/src/hdrhistogram.cc -> Actually, looking at hdr_histogram's code I'm not sure this is correct - you normally call hdr_record_values with the value you want to store (which it expects to be in the range lowest_trackable, highest_trackable). However here you're adding the low bound to it; so it's not going to work.

I think you might still need an explicit bias, but only in the case where the low bound is zero. Alternatively, you could simplify to always bias by the fixed value one; giving you a HdrHistgram class which externally supports values in the range:

 0..N

but that maps to an internal hdr_histogram_c range of:

 1..N+1

Note that means you need to adjust the public (HdrHistogram) low and high bounds when you call hdr_init().

Line:49, engines/ep/src/hdrhistogram.cc -> I think it is simplest to have the bias fixed at + 1.  As that just means we can store 0 - and now this biasing is hidden within the HdrHistogram class.
