DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: Create ItemFreqDecayerTask

Creates an ItemFreqDecayerTask on the initialization of a KVBucket.
It is used to ensure that the frequency counters of items stored in the
hash table do not all become saturated.  When the task runs it will then
snooze for int max and will only be woken up when the frequency counter
of an item in the hash table becomes saturated.

Line:99, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.cc -> We need to be sure that moving this clearing of the flag here doesn't allow for missing wakeup from other threads. I.e. this thread (T1) is at line 98 whilst another thread (T2) finds a saturated counter and needs to wake the task. The cmpxchg by T2 finds notified is still true, so he doesn't wake the task. T1 now exits and the task snoozes, we've lost a wakeup.

Line:99, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.cc -> It is important we do not "over" decay.  So we only want to determine in a second decay is required once the first decay has completely finished.

If a second decay task wants to be started before the first has finished then it is OK to "lose" this second decay task.

Line:102, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.cc -> Done
