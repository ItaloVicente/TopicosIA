DESCRIPTION:

MB-44585: Remove HDRHistogram bias

HDRHistograms currently add 1 to all added values, and subtract 1 from
all read values.

This was done based on the understanding that HDRHistograms cannot
store the value 0, so all values were mapped up by 1 to allow for
storing 0.

This appears to stem from:

 int hdr_init_ex(int64_t lowest_trackable_value,
                 int64_t highest_trackable_value,
                 ...);

Which takes a lowest trackable value argument. If this is set to 0, the
call will later fail in

 int hdr_calculate_bucket_config(...) {
 ...
     if (lowest_trackable_value < 1 ||
             significant_figures < 1 || 5 < significant_figures)
     {
         return EINVAL;
     }
 ...
 }

However, this variable name is misleading. Based on its usage and the
Java HDRHistogram [1] comments, it would be better named
`lowestDiscernibleValue`. It is the lowest _non-zero_ trackable value,
and represents the finest granularity required from the histogram.

Java comment:
   /**
     * Construct a histogram given the Lowest and Highest values to be tracked and a number of significant
     * decimal digits. Providing a lowestDiscernibleValue is useful is situations where the units used
     * for the histogram's values are much smaller that the minimal accuracy required. E.g. when tracking
     * time values stated in nanosecond units, where the minimal accuracy required is a microsecond, the
     * proper value for lowestDiscernibleValue would be 1000.
     *
     * @param lowestDiscernibleValue The lowest value that can be discerned (distinguished from 0) by the histogram.
     *                               Must be a positive integer that is {@literal >=} 1. May be internally rounded
     *                               down to nearest power of 2.
     * @param highestTrackableValue The highest value to be tracked by the histogram. Must be a positive
     *                              integer that is {@literal >=} (2 * lowestDiscernibleValue).
     * @param numberOfSignificantValueDigits The number of significant decimal digits to which the histogram will
     *                                       maintain value resolution and separation. Must be a non-negative
     *                                       integer between 0 and 5.
     */

While this biasing does not generally affect correctness, it leads to
unexpected 0 upper bound buckets when using iterators other than
percentile.

This patch removes the biasing.
