DESCRIPTION:

MB-32150: Include the connectionID in the connection spdlog names

To prevent the inability to register a new logger when two
connections exist with the same name (one is dead, one is not),
prepend the connectionID to the registration name.

Change-Id: Ia227a155d43f51229399ade6dff6800cce01b23d

Line:54, engines/ep/src/connhandler.cc -> Note the ID isn't necessarily globally unique - it's basically the FD number. If you disconnected and re-connected you could end up connected to the same FD (and hence same ID) - which I think is what was happening with the bug right?

Something like this object's address is safer.

Line:54, engines/ep/src/connhandler.cc -> Ahh I see.

I was hoping if it came to using the address to just whack it in the bucketlogger registration stuff but I need to know the name before creating the object. Ended up just doing it here for connection loggers
