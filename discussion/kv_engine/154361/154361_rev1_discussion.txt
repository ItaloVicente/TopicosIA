DESCRIPTION:

MB-46482: Producer needs to account for namespacing of keys on commit/abort

The producer was always accounting in the buffer log for key size
with the namespace prefix which in mad-hatter is not transmitted
to the consumer (for DCP commit and abort). This leads to the consumer
acking for the key size without the prefix, leading to a DCP pause.

When creating a producer abort or commit message, use the 'collection'
mode of the stream to account for the correct key size.

Line:2, tests/testapp_cluster/bucket.cc -> 2021. I think we also need the BSL header here now.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2, tests/testapp_cluster/bucket.cc -> looks like a mis-merge of my mad-hatter cherry-pick
