DESCRIPTION:

MB-36029: Shard Timings::interval_counters by core.

Cache contention was observed when many threads attempt to update
the same interval_counters elements at the same time. Shard this
by core to reduce the contention.

False sharing was also observed with Bucket::response_counters.
Cacheline pad the Timings object to prevent this.

Perf stats (Triton 2 Node 80/20 R/W test):

Before: 3,511,611 (Average of 24 runs)
After: 3,563,007 (Average of 5 runs)
