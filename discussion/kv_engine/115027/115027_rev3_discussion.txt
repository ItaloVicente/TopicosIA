DESCRIPTION:

MB-36067: Make CheckpointManager::clear set correct checkpoint ID

A small omission lead to clear_UNLOCKED always setting the new
checkpoint ID as 1, despite an apparent attempt to set it as 0 if the
vbucket is not active.

Seemingly, the error was introduced when the method was refactored in
http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/98271/ . No consequences of this have
been seen, but based on the noted patch it seems reasonable to restore
the original logic.
