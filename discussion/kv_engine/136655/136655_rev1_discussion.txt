DESCRIPTION:

MB-39745: Change KVBucket::getFlusher to getOneFlusher

The only usage of this function can be replaced with getOneFlusher
(which returns any flusher) as we want shared stats. This is required
so that I can add an EPBucket::getFlusher(Vbid) in a future patch
(as these two functions share a signature).
