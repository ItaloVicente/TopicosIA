Line:250, daemon/connection.cc -> Wouldn't be better to report the absolute last_used_timestamp?
On the contrary, this "duration" is relative to the time when the stat call is issued

Line:250, daemon/connection.cc -> The "problem" with the last_used_timestamp is that it is using std::chrono::steady_clock which is a number relative to "something" and unless we don't dump the current time you have no idea of how long ago that would have been...

When we dump the connection in the logs, and with a "last_used":"60 s" you would have an idea about roughly when that was..
