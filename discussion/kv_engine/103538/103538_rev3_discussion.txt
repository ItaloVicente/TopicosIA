DESCRIPTION:

MB-32589: AddStatsStream: Correctly account allocated mem to NonBucket

AddStatsStream simplifies the calling of the ADD_STAT call when
building a stream of output. However the underlying ADD_STAT callback
can allocate memory which is *not* freed in the ep-engine context -
it's freed by Connection::releaseTempAlloc() inside the daemon.

Therefore it is incorrect to account any memory allocated via ADD_STAT
to the current ep-engine instance - which is what currently happens
when using AddStatsStream. The effect of this is that the mem_used of
a bucket will incorrectly grow everytime AddStatsStream is used. As a
consequence the mis-accounted memory is essentally stolen from the
bucket quota - that amount of memory is no longer available to the
bucket.

There are currently two uses of AddStatsStream - the undocumented stat
groups '_checkpoint-dump' and '_hash-dump' - both of which require
Privilege::Stats (and not just Privilege::SimpleStats). The lowest
Security Role which grants this privilege is `Read-Only Admin`. As
such while the severity of this is high, the liklihood of users
encountering this is expected to be low.

Fix the issue by switching away from the current engine (to null
engine) before calling ADD_STAT in ~AddStatsStream, then switch back
to original engine.
