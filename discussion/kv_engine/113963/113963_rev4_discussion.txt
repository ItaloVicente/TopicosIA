DESCRIPTION:

MB-35633: Store unprepared aborts from disk snapshots

Prior to this patch, aborts received as part of a disk snapshot where
an associated prepare has /not/ been received would be allowed (because
aborts can dedupe the prepare) but would be ignored.

This was first noticed as a problem during unrelated testing in which
closing a checkpoint after a snapshot could try to close an /empty/
checkpoint, if the only item the snapshot contained was an abort which
had deduped the matching prepare.

More significantly, ignoring aborts if the prepare was unseen can lead
to a different replica holding a prepare that will never receive a
completion. Consider one replica connected and received only the abort,
but a second replica received received the prepare before it was
deduped, but has not /yet/ received the abort:

Active    : Pre Abort
Replica 1 : xxx Abort
Replica 2 : Pre

If the active fails and replica 1 is promoted:

 - R1 knows nothing of the prepare, and discarded the abort.
 - R2 has the prepare
 - R2 connects to the active, but the abort will never be sent

This patch avoids this by storing aborts for persistence and
replication even if the matching prepare has been deduped.

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> Does look to be fixed in the later patchsets?

Line:770, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Ah - no. We make another getState() check higher up the call stack too, I guess that is a not-good also :sadpanda:

Line:772, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> moved it as close as possible

Line:791, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> :indeed:

Line:798, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> done

Line:851, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> This is the case this patch is for really - an abort appearing in a state /other than/ a nice prepare ready to be aborted.

Will reword the comment - it's not super clear. The intent was to say "if a prepare was ever in the HT, it has since been completed and is not there anymore (in contrast to the ephemeral case where it is there but completed). I am an abort, I expect a prepare before me, therefore I am a special abort which either needs to be told to GTFO or be blessed to add an aborted item without ever seeing the prepare I am aborting ~dedupe jazz hands~"
