DESCRIPTION:

MB-35633: Store unprepared aborts from disk snapshots

Prior to this patch, aborts received as part of a disk snapshot where
an associated prepare has /not/ been received would be allowed (because
aborts can dedupe the prepare) but would be ignored.

This was first noticed as a problem during unrelated testing in which
closing a checkpoint after a snapshot could try to close an /empty/
checkpoint, if the only item the snapshot contained was an abort which
had deduped the matching prepare.

More significantly, ignoring aborts if the prepare was unseen can lead
to a different replica holding a prepare that will never receive a
completion. Consider one replica connected and received only the abort,
but a second replica received the prepare before it was deduped, but
has not /yet/ received the abort:

Active    : Pre Abort
Replica 1 : xxx Abort
Replica 2 : Pre

If the active fails and replica 1 is promoted:

 - R1 knows nothing of the prepare, and discarded the abort.
 - R2 has the prepare
 - R2 connects to the active, but the abort will never be sent

This patch avoids this by storing aborts for persistence and
replication even if the matching prepare has been deduped.
