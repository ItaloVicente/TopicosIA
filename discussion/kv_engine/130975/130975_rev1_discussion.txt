DESCRIPTION:

Introduce BackfillTrackingIface

Further decouple BackfillManager from DcpConnMap, by introducing a
BackfillTrackingIface. This interface allows the implementer to track
the active Backfills, and is used by BackfillManager to know when to
place Backfills onto the pending list.

By adding this interface it simplifies BackfillManager unit tests - no
need to mock the entire DcpConnMap if behaviour of it needs to be changed.
