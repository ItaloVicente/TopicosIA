DESCRIPTION:

MB-40258: Re-factor CouchKVStore construction

Re-factor CouchKVStore construction to separate out the
responsibilities of creating read-only vs read-write stores.

The read-write store has extra task on creation compared to read-only.

Read-write:
* creates the data directory.
* creates and populates the revision-map which is shared with the
  read-only instance.
* removes any orphaned revision files.
* removes any orphaned .compact files.
