DESCRIPTION:

MB-32862: Correctly encode DCP SnapMarker if last item processed is chk_start

ActiveStream::processItems() can fail to correctly mark a snapshot as
a Checkpoint boundary, if a checkpoint_start item is the last one it
processes.

+Details+

DCP Snapshot represents an ordered sequence of mutations /
deletions. It doesn't necessarily map 1:1: to a checkpoint, because
the ActiveStream may fetch items from the CheckpointManager before the
Checkpoint has been closed. For example, consider an open Checkpoint
which currently contains seqnos 1..2 (but can still have items added);
and a DCP client with a cursor point at the beginning of it:

    Start(1), Mutation("keyA", 1), Mutation("keyB", 2), ...
      ^
      |
    DCP cursor

If an ActiveStream is ready to process data, it will call
getAllItemsForCursor which will advance the cursor to the current end
of the Checkpoint, and return 3 queued_items:

- checkpoint_start(1)
- mutation(1)
- mutation(2)

These are handled by processItems and result in the following DCP
mutations being added to the readyQ:

- SnapshotMarker(1,2)
- Mutation(1)
- Mutation(2)

At this point the cursor is pointing after the current Checkpoint contents:

    Start(1), Mutation("keyA", 1), Mutation("keyB", 2),
                                                      ^
                                                      |
                                                   DCP cursor

Now, consider some more items are added to the checkpoint manager and
a new Checkpoint added:

    Start(1), Mutation("keyA", 1), Mutation("keyB", 2), End(2), Start(3),
                                                      ^
                                                      |
                                                  DCP cursor

ActiveStream wants to process more data, calls getAllItemsForCursor
and receives the following queued_items:

- checkpoint_end(2)
- checkpoint_start(3)

These are again handled by processItems; and should result in the next
SnapshotMarker having the MARKER_FLAG_CHK flag set - to indicate this
is the start of a new Checkpoint. However, it cannot yet add a
SnapshotMarker to the readyQ because SnapshotMarkers must define a
non-empty seqno range - i.e. we cannot create one until at least one
Mutation is also ready to process.

The bug is in this handling - ActiveStream::processItems fails to
account for this "pending" SnapshotMarker and ignores it. When
ActiveStream::processItems is next called (with one more more
mutations) the created Snapshot marker does not have MARKER_FLAG_CHK
flag set.

In the context of normal mutations (non-SyncWrites) this doesn't
really matter - while the replica won't create a Checkpoint when it
should, there's no significant consequence to this, other than the
replica may end up with larger (and more costly to maintain)
checkpoints. However for SyncWrites this breaks the model, as we
cannot de-duplicate SyncWrite related items (prepare_sync_write /
commit_sync_write).

Solution is to record the pending MARKER_FLAG_CHK as part of the
ActiveStream's state (in nextSnapshotIsCheckpoint). When we
subsequently receive at least one more mutation (and hence can enqueue
a SnapshotMarker), we can use nextSnapshotIsCheckpoint to snapshot it
correctly.
