DESCRIPTION:

MB-48038: Introduce checkpoint_max_size in configuration

That is the maximum size (in bytes) for a single checkpoint.
'0' triggers EP auto-setup, where the value is determined based on other
system parameters (eg, num of vbuckets, checkpoint quota, max num of
checkpoints per vbucket, etc..) for optimal balance and checkpoint memory
releasing capabilities.

The new quantity will be used for determining when it's time to create a new
checkpoint in CM.
The general idea on auto-setup is that ideally we would like to spread the load
across all the allowed checkpoints. Also, a memory-based trigger is a more
general approach than the existing item-based one.

The patch adds the logic for:
- The new (dynamic) param in configuration
- Caching the param in KVBucket::checkpointMaxSize
- Computing the final value for KVBucket::checkpointMaxSize

KVBucket::checkpointMaxSize is set but still unused here.
