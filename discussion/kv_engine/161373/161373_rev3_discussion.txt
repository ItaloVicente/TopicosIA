DESCRIPTION:

MB-48038: Introduce checkpoint_max_size in configuration

That is the maximum size (in bytes) for a single checkpoint.
'0' triggers EP auto-setup, where the value is determined based on other
system parameters (eg, num of vbuckets, checkpoint quota, max num of
checkpoints per vbucket, etc..) for optimal balance and checkpoint memory
releasing capabilities.

The new quantity will be used for determining when it's time to create a new
checkpoint in CM.
The general idea on auto-setup is that ideally we would like to spread the load
across all the allowed checkpoints. Also, a memory-based trigger is a more
general approach than the existing item-based one.

The patch adds the logic for:
- The new (dynamic) param in configuration
- Caching the param in KVBucket::checkpointMaxSize
- Computing the final value for KVBucket::checkpointMaxSize

KVBucket::checkpointMaxSize is set but still unused here.

Line:246, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Might be worth clarifying memory size - at a glance a reader might mistake this for an item count limit

Line:2859, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> In a small dev node this might be pretty tiny, is it worth adding a min value?

Line:1073, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> This looks unintentional 😊

Line:246, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Done

Line:2859, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Indeed - actually we need to make sure that we can queue at least 1 mutation in each checkpoint.. fixing

Line:1073, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Done

Line:2859, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> So I believe that here the best thing to do is to allow any small value and then just ensuring that we use this limit properly, ie at least 1 mutation always allowed in checkpoint, eg in queueDirty():

if (openCkptSize >= checkpointMaxSize && openCkptNumItems > 0) {
    create-new-open-checkpoint
}

So if the checkpoint is empty we just skip over and queue the item.

Otherwise the problem is, how do you define the min-value? In theory for the general case we should set it to 20MB (ie, the max size of a value) + the overhead for checkpoint/item overhead. Let't say 21MB for being on the safe side.

But on the common 1k/2k/some-k value-size workload that 21MB would be probably suboptimal..

Line:2859, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Sounds reasonable - seems like a similar situation to that of BufferLog::Insert; configurable limit but definitely allow at least one item.

Just as a sanity check, if max_checkpoints=20 a typical cluster_run single node would then get:

256MB*0.5/1024/20
0.00625MB

6.4kB per checkpoint

Exactly.

> .. 6.4kB per checkpoint

Yes, which sounds really too small, but I would argue the usage of 1024 vbuckets and 20 checkpoints per vb on a 256 quota setup

Let's say you do 64 vbs and 10 ckpts per vb, it ends up with 256MB*0.5/64/100 = 200K.
On a 1k workload it ends up with 200 items per checkpoints, which doesn't sounds totally unreasonable.

Unfortunately only testing+profiling will give us answers on that - The final purpose all these changes for now is more get to a super flexible/tunable Checkpoint configuration rather setting the perfect defaults.
