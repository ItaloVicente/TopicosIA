DESCRIPTION:

MB-48038: Introduce checkpoint_max_size in configuration

That is the maximum size (in bytes) for a single checkpoint.
'0' triggers EP auto-setup, where the value is determined based on other
system parameters (eg, num of vbuckets, checkpoint quota, max num of
checkpoints per vbucket, etc..) for optimal balance and checkpoint memory
releasing capabilities.

The general idea on auto-setup is that ideally we would like to spread the load
across all the allowed checkpoints. Also, a memory-based trigger is a more
general approach than the existing item-based one.
