DESCRIPTION:

MB-33858 [SR]: Remove tracked from PassiveDM at receiving DCP_COMMIT

At receiving a Commit for a tracked Prepare, the Prepare is removed from
the tracked Container in PassiveDM.
This patch wires up VBucket and PassiveDM so that committed Prepares are
removed from tracking when a DCP_COMMIT message is received on
PassiveStream.

Line:1109, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Prefer switch when there's multiple choices (and we want to handle each one).

Line:813, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> IIRC you need to also need to set the high_seqno here - see other calls to this in the same file.

Line:1109, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> My first thought at this comment: "we don't want to handle them all".
But now we do, given that we decided to handle also vbstate-deaad :) doing

Line:813, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> Automatically set to CM::last_by_seqno, which (I believe) is fine as I use this call only for having 1 Checkpoint in CM

Line:813, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> Note I changed the above ones as they broke some RocksDB tests because lastBySeqno wasn't updated. Either way, better to be consistent with the other uses in this file.
