DESCRIPTION:

Log if bucket allocation or init exceeds 1s (each)

We've seen bug reports where the entire create_bucket call took
_minutes_, but given that the entire create bucket logic is
quite complex (dispatched over to the executor pool, iterate
over all buckets to check it it exists, potentially create
object and initialize, notify the cookie and resume execution)
it is hard to tell _where_ all of the time was spent.
