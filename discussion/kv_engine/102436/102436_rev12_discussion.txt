DESCRIPTION:

MB-31978: Include SID in active_stream logging

With many streams enabled, the logging is confusing if
only the vb is used, so create a logPrefix and use
that in all logging (and exceptions).

Patch Set 12: Code-Review-1

Would be simpler and easier to read if you put the prefix in the log function in active_stream_impl.h. Can simply pass it as the second/third parameter in to the producer logger/global bucket logger and avoid the need for including it everywhere the log function is called. Still needed for throws though

Tried that way and it requires the active_stream_impl to either be given the format string which assumes the prefix will be there (which seemed clumsy), or to somehow rebuild the fmt parameter so that the prefix is added to fmt before passing down to the next level (producer->log or globalBucketLogger)

Wouldn't want to assume the prefix is there. Currently the call to the globalBucketLogger rebuilds the fmt parameter to do exactly this (second argument), although actually hitting this should be rare. Doing the same would be added expense so think it's liveable
