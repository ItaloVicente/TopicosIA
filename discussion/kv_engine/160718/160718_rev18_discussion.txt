DESCRIPTION:

MB-47462: Introduce "eager" checkpoint removal

Adds config param `checkpoint_removal_mode`.

Prior to this patch, closed unreferenced checkpoints could remain in
memory for an extended amount of time.

In a steady state system, closed unreffed checkpoints have
comparatively little value; they will only ever be used again if a new
DCP stream is created or a cursor reregistered after being dropped.

In addition, to avoid unnecessarily evicting items when memory could
instead be recovered from unreffed checkpoints, PagingVisitors
currently remove closed unreffed checkpoints before evicting. This does
not provide clear separation of concerns.

It has also been seen that in heavy bulk load scenarios, PagingVisitors
may remove more checkpoints than the dedicated CheckpointVisitor, and
checkpoint removal becomes a reasonable percentage of the run time of
the PagingVisitor.

"Eager" checkpoint removal queues closed checkpoints for destruction as
soon as they become unreferenced; rather than reactively working to
free checkpoints in an OOM situation they can be proactively removed
as soon as possible.

Line:28, /COMMIT_MSG -> Possibly also mention the fact we avoid the scanning effort to find and identify such checkpoints with this mode?

Line:445, engines/ep/configuration.json -> "unreffed" - suggest avoiding abbreviations when first used in a context (i.e. this sentence here) - stick with "unreferenced".

Line:22, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_config.h -> Ditto here (unreffed).

Line:110, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_config.h -> The config param is not dynamic; as such can this be const?

Also - probably nicer to represent with the enum given that's more self-documenting (if false then not necessarily obvious what the state is)

Line:542, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Method name has changed.

Line:564, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Can the argument be made a (const) reference ?

Line:571, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Ditto - reference?

Line:82, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Should the task even be running in this mode?

Line:117, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.h -> Please document.

Line:28, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:445, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Done

Line:22, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_config.h -> Done

Line:110, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_config.h -> Checked, turns out a couple of places in tests/mocks expect to be able to assign the config as the manager holds a reference to it, and making this const will require slightly wider changes.

Arguably tests might not want to assume the manager is in a sane state if they rewrite the config directly...

Happy to squash the needed changes into this patch, or leave this non-const here and make it a followup.

Line:542, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Done

Line:564, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Done

Line:571, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Done

Line:82, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Ech, it definitely doesn't need to run periodically - but that's already a planned change separate from eager checkpoint removal, so I'd rather not change that here.

As discussed previously, the task needs renaming in a followup to something like "EmergencyCheckpointMemoryRecoveryTask". It still has work to do when notified because the CM quota has been exceeded, so there are definitely reasons why it would be running even with eager checkpoint removal.

Line:117, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.h -> Done
