DESCRIPTION:

MB-47462: Introduce "eager" checkpoint removal

Adds config param `checkpoint_removal_mode`.

Prior to this patch, closed unreferenced checkpoints could remain in
memory for an extended amount of time.

In a steady state system, closed unreffed checkpoints have
comparatively little value; they will only ever be used again if a new
DCP stream is created or a cursor reregistered after being dropped.

In addition, to avoid unnecessarily evicting items when memory could
instead be recovered from unreffed checkpoints, PagingVisitors
currently remove closed unreffed checkpoints before evicting. This does
not provide clear separation of concerns.

It has also been seen that in heavy bulk load scenarios, PagingVisitors
may remove more checkpoints than the dedicated CheckpointVisitor, and
checkpoint removal becomes a reasonable percentage of the run time of
the PagingVisitor.

"Eager" checkpoint removal queues closed checkpoints for destruction as
soon as they become unreferenced; rather than reactively working to
free checkpoints in an OOM situation they can be proactively removed
as soon as possible. This also avoids spending time scanning vbuckets
to identify removable checkpoints.

Line:452, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Are we making this dynamic at some point?

Line:126, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> auto* const

Line:457, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Seems like this is called only by maybeDeferredDestroyCheckpoint() ?
If so, we can directly make the checks there and remove this function

Line:637, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Would be nice to remove the suffix given that it doesn't add any further noise to the patch

Line:88, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> I would defer this part to a dedicated change, so we can easily compare the effect of removing the CheckpointRemoval step from this task

Line:564, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> can some of these methods be pushed to Checkpoint, and maybe a tweak on the naming helps imho

if (checkpoint.isElligibleForEagerRemoval(config)) {
}

Line:571, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> I'm finding this name difficult to parse - maybeScheduleDestruction or something? Given the parameter type I also don't think it needs to say Checkpoint in the name - a member of Checkpoint a better option?

checkpoint.maybeScheduleDestruction()

or we can keep similar top vbucket deffered deletion which has functions like

VBucket::setupDeferredDeletion

Which in this context could be (given the eager vs lazy)

Checkpoint::maybeSetupDeferredDeletion

Line:452, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Potentially - it doesn't seem likely that there would be issues dynamically changing eager->lazy, but I'd like to do more testing on lazy->eager to make sure nothing goes wrong, so for now leaving non-dynamic

Line:126, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Done

Line:457, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> also called in removeCursor

Line:564, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> renamed - it'd be nice to make it a property of the checkpoint itself, but atm the checkpoint is not aware of if it is the oldest checkpoint

Line:571, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> renamed

Line:637, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Done

Line:88, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> I'd prefer to add an dev assert - there should truly be nothing for it to do any any point, ever, if eager checkpoint removal is configured.
Don't want to make it a plain Expects as it's not free to check all the vbuckets just to find there's nothing to do.

Can stagger removing the scan out into another patch if you'd like an intermediate perf datapoint, but I'm not sure comparing it to no-scan perf will give us a clear "X causes Y perf change"; the scan is both extra work here and extra contention, but at the same time eager may make this scan infrequent occurrence (through memToClear being 0 more of the time)
