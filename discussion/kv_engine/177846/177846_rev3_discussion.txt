DESCRIPTION:

MB-52054: LabelledStatCollector use vector over unordered_map

Use a std::vector over an std::unordered_map for
LabelledStatCollector::defaultLabels as we only ever access the contents
of the object in a linear fashion. Meaning we not need the extra
complexity of O(1) key indexing that a std::unordered_map can provide.
This will allow us to save memory and reduce the number of memory
allocations that might be performed by std::unordered_map.

This patch also removes LabelledStatCollector::hasLabel() as it's unused
and is the only reason that LabelledStatCollector::defaultLabels should
be a std::unordered_map apposed to a std::vector of std::pairs.

Line:107, include/statistics/labelled_collector.h -> IIRC the original intent was to allow codepaths to ensure the caller has already provided appropriate labels (e.g., "bucket")... obviously didn't put it to use :badpokerface:

Line:31, statistics/labelled_collector.cc -> This won't ensure labels are unique at this stage, nor does ClientMetric down the line.

I'd recommend testing what happens if you add a label twice. It might "just work" if prometheus-cpp has well defined behaviour in that case (e.g., takes the last instance of the label), but if it happily writes out two instances of a label in the scrape result, then the output likely won't be valid.

Though, the docs at https://github.com/prometheus/docs/blob/main/content/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats.md#text-format-details don't specifically call out uniqueness of labels...

And going another layer deeper, if it's out of spec, Prometheus _might_ still accept it, but we'd possibly be in undefined/implementation defined behaviour and open to future breakage.

OTOH, if Prometheus is strict about it, a duplicate label might wreck metric collection from KV (again, don't know, would need testing)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:31, statistics/labelled_collector.cc -> Ack replaced with boost::flat_map which has the same semantics as an unordered_map
