DESCRIPTION:

[RocksDB] Re-enable support for RocksDB as default

When we enabled RocksDB the first time, we had the MB-26142 issue caused
by the use of a non-portable RocksDB library. Then we instructed CBDeps
and the Build scripts to respectively build a portable RocksDB library
and use it (MB-26158). So now with this change we can re-enable RocksDB.
