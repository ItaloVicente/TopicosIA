DESCRIPTION:

Add DummyCookie and DummyConnection

The statistics tests just need a Cookie to be passed along
(and it could be that we'll create more tests like that
in the future so it makes sense to make them "reusable")

This removes the dependeny to mock_server (and link with
both memcached_daemon and mock_server which provides
a different version of the server API which makes it hard
to move that to free functions: MB-55137)
