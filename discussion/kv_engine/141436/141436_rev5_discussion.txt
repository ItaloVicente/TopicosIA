DESCRIPTION:

MB-32670 [4/4]: Allow clients supporting Snappy to bgFetch items as compressed

When scheduling a bgFetch for a cookie which supports Snappy
compression, request that the bgFetch uses
ValueFilter::COMPRESSED_VALUE, to avoid unnecessarily decompressing
the item.

This results in both the item restored to the HashTable and the item
returned to the client being in Snappy-compressed format.

Line:1930, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> This feels bit like mixing in passive mode... The bucket setting is set to off, but still we allow fetching of objects from disk with compression if the client have it enabled (next check) and those will stay in memory as compressed (and inflated to other connections "on the fly" every time they're accessed.

Line:1930, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Note the next check only _disables_ fetching as compressed, if it was previously enabled (and the client doesn't support Snappy).

As such, we shouldn't have anything in memory compressed if bucket compression is off.

Line:1930, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Sorry.. I hadn't had my coffee yet so I didn't see the tiny ! before engine and read ValueFilter::VALUES_COMPRESSED ...

note to self, don't read code before coffee in the morning...
