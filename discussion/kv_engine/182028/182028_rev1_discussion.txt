DESCRIPTION:

MB-53304: Enforce holding of stateLock in VBucket::queueItem [8/n]

MB-53304 suggests we ensure that the stateLock is held by passing a ref
to it in queueItem (and the call hierarchy of queueItem).

This change ensures that we hold the VBucket state lock when creating a
pending SyncWrite.

In a future change I will pass this ref down to queueItem.
