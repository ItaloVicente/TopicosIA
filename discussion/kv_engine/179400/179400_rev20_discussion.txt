DESCRIPTION:

MB-53052: Update frequencies for all Buckets when unified caching

We want the frequency counters of items in buckets sharing memory to
relate to one another such that we can make eviction decisions across
buckets.

This change adds a new BucketItemFreqDecayerTask which orchestrates the
execution of the per-item ItemFreqDecayerTask for all buckets sharing
memory. By running the ItemFreqDecayerTask the same number of times for
unified caching buckets, the resulting frequency counters will have
been decremented the same number of times, which will make
cross-bucket frequency counter comparisons make sense.
