DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Refactor how we split checkpoints for collections

The old by-name mode of collections required that the create/drop events
were split into separate checkpoints as they could be de-duplicated and
lead to clients seeing mutations to a collection without ever seeing a
collection create marker.

E.g.

seq1: $create:beer
seq2: mutation beer::x
seq3: $create:beer - deleted
seq4: $create:beer (a new generation of beer)

Without the code adding the new checkpoint, that sequence can become

seq2: mutation beer::x
seq4: $create:beer

The client can correctly see that sequence as invalid.

With the change to by-id collections, this is no longer required but we
do still need to put the collection/scope delete into a separate
checkpoint.

E.g.

seq1: $create:8 (collection 8 is beer)
seq2: mutation cid:8 key:x
seq3: $create:8 - deleted
seq4: $create:9 (a new generation of beer)

We create a new CP for the collection drop so that we don't end up with:

seq2: mutation cid:8 key:x
seq3: $create:8 - deleted
seq4: $create:9 (a new generation of beer)

We instead end up with:

seq1: $create:8 (collection 8 is beer)
seq2: mutation cid:8 key:x
..... new cp ....
seq3: $create:8 - deleted
seq4: $create:9 (a new generation of beer)
