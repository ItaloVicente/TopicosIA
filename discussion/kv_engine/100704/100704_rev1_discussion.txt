DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Convert expiration to same parameters as deletion_v2

This change is due to the requirement that if DCP control has been
set to output expiry opcodes, it should also have delete times
enabled which is the trigger for using deletion_v2.

Change-Id: I9a5e2a8747249b91408258b1103d3a77ac6238d8

Line:930, daemon/connection.h -> if we are going to make these have identical signatures; might be simpler to just have a single method; and then add a deleteSource parameter to it.

Line:930, daemon/connection.h -> I don't particularly agree with this, as this would require a change to the dcp header file. Seeming as we are implementing the expiry opcode having expiration as a separate function both signifies that its opcode is different and makes it easier to find.

Line:930, daemon/connection.h -> Well, by that rationale we should have a single method for deletion & deletion_v2 given they are the same opcode ;)

I don't see any issue with changing the dcp_header file; it's an internal interface.

Perhaps consider if we can share more of the deletion and expiration code - perhaps implementing them both using a single common function?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:930, daemon/connection.h -> The next patch (Introduce usage of Expiration event for DCP) unifies the majority of the code between deletion_v2 and expiration inside Connection::deletionOrExpirationV2. Although not making any changes to the function structure, it does reduce the amount of code duplication. 
Does this meet the requirements? ;) If so, I can move it into this patch to simplify the amount of code repetition.
