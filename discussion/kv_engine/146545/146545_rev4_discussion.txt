DESCRIPTION:

Use the sendbuffer for items > 256 bytes

Previously we would copy all data into temporary objects if the
payload was less than 4k, but given that the sendbuffer objects will
be allocated and released by the same thread it should be available
in jemallocs tcache and cheap to allocate.

Note that if we _don't_ use the sendbuffer there may still be
memory allocation as that cause copying into buffevents own buffers
and it may not be room for the data we want to add in the current
buffer (the buffers in libevent starts by 1k and then double in
size (and that 1k include the internal overhead of libevent)) so
for a typical get of a document in our system we'll do the following
allocations:

Document < ~900 bytes

1 Allocate a chunk to keep track of the 24 byte protocol header.
  A 1k buffer gets allocated.

The documents payload fits within the already allocated buffer
so no further allocations is needed

Document > 900 bytes && < 4k

1 Allocate a chunk to keep track of the 24 byte protocol header.
  A 1k buffer gets allocated.
2 Allocate a chunk to keep track of the payload (size 2/4/8k)

Document > 4k

1 Allocate a chunk to keep track of the 24 byte protocol header.
  A 1k buffer gets allocated.
2 Allocate a chain to keep track of the referenced unit
  It looks like another 1k buffer gets allocated.

From this it looks like we might just as well put the limit ~900
bytes... Then again if there is a pipeline of commands we may
be better off allocating a bigger chunk and put data into
that :S
