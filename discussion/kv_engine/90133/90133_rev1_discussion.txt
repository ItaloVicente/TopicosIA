DESCRIPTION:

CouchRocks: Control space amplification under Universal Compaction

Under Universal Compaction we can control (relax/narrow) the space
amplification constraint using an internal RocksDB option. From RocksDB
documentation:

  "The size amplification is defined as the amount (in percentage) of
   additional storage needed to store a single byte of data in the
   database.
   For example, a size amplification of 2% means that a database
   that contains 100 bytes of user-data may occupy upto 102 bytes of
   physical storage. By this definition, a fully compacted database
   has a size amplification of 0%.
   Default: 200, which means that a 100 byte database could require
   upto 300 bytes of storage."

With this change we introduce the new
'rocksdb_uc_max_size_amplification_percent' parameter in configuration.
We keep the RocksDB default as baseline value.
