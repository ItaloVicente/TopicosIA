DESCRIPTION:

MB-51805: Pass persistedPrepareSeqno(maxPrepareSeqno) into Checkpoint

We set the value of the first Checkpoint to this value to ensure
that the on disk HPS is correctly updated if we partially persist
a snapshot, restart, and find on streaming the rest of the snapshot
that it does not contain any prepares.
