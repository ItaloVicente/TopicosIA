DESCRIPTION:

MB-26972: JSON DCP Filter must also accept name and uid format

If a client wants to re-connect a DCP stream (non-zero) they must
be specific about the collection so they don't miss a intermediate
collection delete during their downtime.

This commit updates Collections::Filter so two formats of JSON are
valid and updates Collections::VB::Filter to use the strict name/uid
checks when the client uses the name:uid format.

A subsequent patch will ensure that the client does a name:uid request
when the start-seqno is non-zero.
