DESCRIPTION:

MB-41138: Simplify magma dynamic wal buffer size algorithm

Change configuration.json magma_initial_wal_buffer_size to
magma_default_wal_buffer_size and use that as the wal buffer size unless
magma detects a low memory scenario in which case magma will resize the
wal buffer to 64KB.

Just a couple small things/questions
Line:1099, engines/ep/configuration.json -> what's the justification for 2MB over the previous max of 4MB?

Line:1101, engines/ep/configuration.json -> might be worth a brief explanation of what magma considers to be a "low memory scenario" here (if it's easy to explain)

Line:60, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> you might want to add this smaller default to the default magma config in test_helpers too.

Line:1099, engines/ep/configuration.json -> The original wal buffer size was 2MB. We then tried to have a dynamic wal buffer size with a range of 64KB to 4MB. Since that doesn't work, we are going back to a fixed size of 2MB. In almost all scenarios, we use considerably less than 2MB of wal buffer size.
We most likely will attempt to revisit dynamic wal buffer size but its quite difficult given that every kv txn is really 2 txns... 1 with items (random size) and 1 with vbstate (fixed size). The vbstate updates tend to skew the size we really want but its difficult to identify the vbstate updates.

Line:1101, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I updated magma_write_cache_ratio to define what a low memory scenario is.

Line:60, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> This might end up getting really complicated because different tests require different sets of configuration parameters in order to run. You'll notice that we have 2 sets of configuration parameters which currently do not overlap and therefore can be combined if necessary. But this combination overlaps and cannot be combined. I'd prefer to leave as is.
