DESCRIPTION:

MB-34906: Make PDM seqnoAck highest persisted snapshotEnd

Problem:
The PDM seqnoAcks immediately if only Majority or
MajorityAndPersistToMaster prepares are encountered, but once a
PersistToMajority Prepare is found it must wait for the entire snapshot
to persist.

To do this, the PDM waits for the current persistedSeqno to exceed the
snapshotEnd, *but* the PDM only tracked the latest snapshotEnd seqno -
updated each time a snapshot end is received.

If a new snapshotEnd is received before persistence "catches up", the
PDM will wait until the end of the new snapshot. If this happens
continuously (i.e., under continuous load), the PDM might never ack.

Rejected Solution:
Add a "last prepare in snapshot" flag which is set on the last prepare
when notified of snapshotEnd. Rejected because persistence and
snapshotEnd notifications both call updateHighPreparedSeqno which would
have to scan the entire trackedWrites list to determine if a snapshot
had ended yet - this might lead to poor performance.

Solution:
Track a queue of snapshotEnd seqnos, and seqnoAck the highest
persisted, rather than waiting to persist the latest

Line:64, engines/ep/src/monotonic_queue.h -> Quick question Dave - IIRC Monotonic only has a const l-value operator= , so one level deeper there will still be a copy will there not?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:64, engines/ep/src/monotonic_queue.h -> That's true - I didn't check Monotonic<>. However it's good practice if you're adding a rvalue-reference overload to do the right thing here (at least) :)

Although having said that, you actually want the std::move when it's finally consumed - i.e. queue.push().
