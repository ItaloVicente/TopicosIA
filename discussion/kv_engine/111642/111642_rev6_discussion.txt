DESCRIPTION:

MB-34906: Make PDM seqnoAck at each received snapEnd

Problem:
The PDM seqnoAcks immediately if only Majority or
MajorityAndPersistToMaster prepares are encountered, but once a
PersistToMajority Prepare is found it must wait for the entire snapshot
to persist.

To do this, the PDM waits for the current persistedSeqno to exceed the
snapshotEnd, *but* the PDM only tracked the latest snapshotEnd seqno -
updated each time a snapshot end is received.

If a new snapshotEnd is received before persistence "catches up", the
PDM will wait until the end of the new snapshot. If this happens
continuously (i.e., under continuous load), the PDM might never ack.

Rejected Solution:
Add a "last prepare in snapshot" flag which is set on the last prepare
when notified of snapshotEnd. Rejected because persistence and
snapshotEnd notifications both call updateHighPreparedSeqno which would
have to scan the entire trackedWrites list to determine if a snapshot
had ended yet - this might lead to poor performance.

Solution:
Track a queue of snapshotEnd seqnos, and seqnoAck at each one.

Line:353, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> This is evil - you're capturing (by reference) a non-const variable which is modified throughout the course of the function (and where the lambda is called). 

To the reader looking at the main while loop below it's totally invisible that the (moving) snapshotEndSeqno is being used here.

Just pass it as an argument to the lambda.

Also - you only need trackedWrites.end() from this; simply copy that into a local variable and capture that in the lambda.

Line:363, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> This can have much smaller scope (i.e. put it in the block it's used).

Furthermore, once you do that I think you'll see it really doesn't add that much - with all the boilerplate it's arguably less terse than just inlining it:

 advanceHPSWhile([&](auto sw) {
     return inSnapshot(sw) &&
     sw->getDurabilityReqs().getLevel() != cb::durability::Level::PersistToMajority;
 });

Line:367, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> This also feels over complex - your two predicates are the same apart from the fact that in case 2 you also check if it's not a persist-to-majority write.

I don't think the added indirection is helping the readability (or potentially perforce - you're coping lambdas all over the place).

Just do something like the following:

 while (...) {
    const level maxLevelCanAdvance = 
    (pdm.vb.getPersistenceSeqno() >= snapshotEndSeqno)
     ? PersistMajority : MajorityAndPersistActive;
     for (next = getIteratorNext(highPreparedSeqno.it);
           inSnapshot && next->getDurabilityReqs().getlevel < maxLevelCanAdvance;
next = getIteratorNext(highPreparedSeqno.it)) {
          // Now in body of for loop, update highPrepared...
     }
 }

Line:363, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Definitely - it used to be more widely used, will tidy
