DESCRIPTION:

MB-34906: Make PDM seqnoAck highest persisted snapshotEnd

Problem:
The PDM seqnoAcks immediately if only Majority or
MajorityAndPersistToMaster prepares are encountered, but once a
PersistToMajority Prepare is found it must wait for the entire snapshot
to persist.

To do this, the PDM waits for the current persistedSeqno to exceed the
snapshotEnd, *but* the PDM only tracked the latest snapshotEnd seqno -
updated each time a snapshot end is received.

If a new snapshotEnd is received before persistence "catches up", the
PDM will wait until the end of the new snapshot. If this happens
continuously (i.e., under continuous load), the PDM might never ack.

Rejected Solution:
Add a "last prepare in snapshot" flag which is set on the last prepare
when notified of snapshotEnd. Rejected because persistence and
snapshotEnd notifications both call updateHighPreparedSeqno which would
have to scan the entire trackedWrites list to determine if a snapshot
had ended yet - this might lead to poor performance.

Solution:
Track a queue of snapshotEnd seqnos, and seqnoAck the highest
persisted, rather than waiting to persist the latest

(5 comments)
Line:378, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> You don't really have two cases now in the code below - or at least it's somewhat implicit in the for loop.

Please re-write this comment - it's fine to keep the discussion of the two cases, but suggest you re-phrase based on how it's implemented by checking maxLevelCanAdvance (and explain what that variable is used for).

Line:266, engines/ep/src/monotonic.h -> Needs documenting.

Line:270, engines/ep/src/monotonic.h -> You should have a non-const overload of this (otherwise a user has no way to obtain a mutable version of the item which is removed by pop()).

Line:284, engines/ep/src/monotonic.h -> You should also implement the rvalue-reference overload to avoid unnecessary copies (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/queue/push).

Line:292, engines/ep/src/monotonic.h -> This is polluting the monotonic.h header somewhat. This is already a relatively slow header to compile, you're now forcing all users or it to pull in <queue> even if they dont' need it.

Please move this to it's own monotonic_queue.h file.
