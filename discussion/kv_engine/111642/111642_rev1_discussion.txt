DESCRIPTION:

MB-34906: Make PDM seqnoAck at each received snapEnd

Problem:
The PDM seqnoAcks immediately if only Majority or
MajorityAndPersistToMaster prepares are encountered, but once a
PersistToMajority Prepare is found it must wait for the entire snapshot
to persist.

To do this, the PDM waits for the current persistedSeqno to exceed the
snapshotEnd, *but* the PDM only tracked the latest snapshotEnd seqno -
updated each time a snapshot end is received.

If a new snapshotEnd is received before persistence "catches up", the
PDM will wait until the end of the new snapshot. If this happens
continuously (i.e., under continuous load), the PDM might never ack.

Solution:
Track a queue of snapshotEnd seqnos, and seqnoAck at each one.

I recognise this has a bit more refactoring that is strictly necessary for the change, but it will simplify the following patch, and is functionally the same (... according to the passing tests)
