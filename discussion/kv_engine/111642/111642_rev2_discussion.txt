DESCRIPTION:

MB-34906: Make PDM seqnoAck at each received snapEnd

Problem:
The PDM seqnoAcks immediately if only Majority or
MajorityAndPersistToMaster prepares are encountered, but once a
PersistToMajority Prepare is found it must wait for the entire snapshot
to persist.

To do this, the PDM waits for the current persistedSeqno to exceed the
snapshotEnd, *but* the PDM only tracked the latest snapshotEnd seqno -
updated each time a snapshot end is received.

If a new snapshotEnd is received before persistence "catches up", the
PDM will wait until the end of the new snapshot. If this happens
continuously (i.e., under continuous load), the PDM might never ack.

Solution:
Track a queue of snapshotEnd seqnos, and seqnoAck at each one.

(6 comments)
Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> Worth elaborating why we decided not to put a snapshot end in the trackedWrites

Line:379, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> don't think we need this given we don't ack until after this function has completed. Could we just move the HPS instead of assigning it later?

Line:384, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> not sure we need this either but if it is more readable then fine

Line:418, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> TODO with why you added (for your future change) please

Line:424, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> same comment as above

Line:438, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> as discussed, not clear that if we break here then we also break at the below bread (line 457). needs refactor or comment

Line:344, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> Might be worth wrapping the std::queue in a mini class which asserts the seqnos are monotonic on enqueue (see CompletedQueue)

Line:360, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Avoid a wildcard capture - makes it harder to determine exactly what state is access / modified by the lambda.

Line:388, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Stye - prefer a for() loop as that's more idiomatic for an iteration which has a single known termination clause. It also constrains the scope of the nextPrepare variable.

Line:418, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> There's duplication here - both of the overall while loop and of some of the checks inside.

Consider restructuring this so we don't duplicate code - for example maybe extract some of the code inside each loop into helper functions; I believe we should be able to simplify the code here.
