DESCRIPTION:

Avoid recreating MetricServer with same config

If the same config is set repeatedly, there is no need to recreate the
Prometheus exporter each time.

This is relevant when setting the port to 0:

* config port set to zero
* MetricServer created on random port X
* config port set to X
* MetricServer recreated on port X explicitly

This avoids potential issues around encountering the socket in
TIME_WAIT.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

This should be checked in Settings::updateSettings. If you look at the other variables in there they only set them (and fire the callback) if the configuration differs from the current configuration.

I agree that it that would be much more consistent, but in the specific case of port=0, from updateSettings' perspective the config _does_ differ. The server is already listening on some port X, but updating the config from port=0 to port=X doesn't need to recreate the server.

I raised this from testing around http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/139369 , but that patch actually introduced a bug around the order of recreating the metric server (unrelated to the crash which lead to it being reverted).

Before that change (or after it was reverted) the change listener can always destroy the current instance in the singleton, even if this is a nested change listener call (triggered for setting port=0, then _again_ for setting port=X). _With_ the above change, which moved to returning a unique_ptr, the nested call could _not_ destroy the running instance in the nested call case because it hadn't been returned from create yet.

So, the change listener tried to create a second metric server on port X, which failed because the MetricServer just created with port=0 is still listening on the port it selected, X.

In general it seems worth avoiding destroying and recreating it on the same port.

Also, as the config is changed to port=X by cb::prometheus::initialize using setPrometheusConfig, I assume updateSettings wouldn't be in play at that point in time?

_personally_ I think that it should work like this:
* If the new family is different than the current family we should reconfigure
* If the port in the new configuration is different than the port in the current configuration we should reconfigure (there is one exception here and that is if the current configuration had '0' and the kernel returned the port which is now in the new configuration).

I tried to run this code (with the one you had in testapp) and sent some reconfigure and saw:

    2020-11-05T12:06:07.911700+01:00 INFO Change prometheus port to IPv4 port 0
    2020-11-05T12:06:08.073099+01:00 INFO Prometheus Exporter started, listening on family:inet port:34439

    2020-11-05T12:06:08.687343+01:00 INFO Prometheus Exporter started, listening on family:inet port:42191

Given that the one providing the configuration didn't have any specific requests for the port I don't see why we need to switch to another port.

One comment I would add here. If I understand correctly, if port==0 then we create a socket (letting the kernel assign a port) and then _update_ the same config key with the kernel-selected port. Personally that feels incorrect - the _configuration_ hasn't changed, we just have a result of that config. I.e. we should leave port=0 in the config, but say expose the chosen port number via a stats metric or similar. That way the behaviour you request above should be automatic.

I agree that leaving port=0 in the config seems reasonable, and means there's no special logic needed to avoid recreating the MetricServer. Trond, you requested the config be updated with the port the MetricServer listens on if port=0 is set, is that needed for a specific purpose that would break if it is not done?

I've flipped to not storing the port number back in the config for now, but awaiting Trond's feedback. Easy to go back to the earlier version if needed :)
