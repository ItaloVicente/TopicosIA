DESCRIPTION:

Avoid recreating MetricServer when setting same config

If the same config is set repeatedly, normally a new MetricServer will
not be created because the config has not changed.

However, when setting the port to 0 this was not previously the case.
Instead, the config would be updated with the allocated port the
MetricServer was actually listening on. As a result, setting the
original config (with port=0) again _did_ recreate the MetricServer, as
the config no longer matched the original.

> I agree that leaving port=0 in the config seems reasonable, and means there's no special logic needed to avoid recreating the MetricServer. Trond, you requested the config be updated with the port the MetricServer listens on if port=0 is set, is that needed for a specific purpose that would break if it is not done?


We don't need that to be stored in the settings object, but when I added the dump to the interface file (before you had done all of the work and got prometheus in there) I picked the info from Settings in NetworkInterfaceManager::writeInterfaceFile. If you just grab the info there we should be good to go (so that people may pick up the port being used)
