DESCRIPTION:

MB-55520: Ensure != ckpt types not merged at CM::getItemsForCursor

Issue introduced at https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/185612
(MB-55337).
That patch introduces some code in CM::getItemsForCursor() that might
lead to merging checkpoints of different types.

That might lead to a state where ActiveStream gets returned for
streaming a Disk snapshot with missing HCS.

Details covered in the unit tests and comments in this fic patch.
