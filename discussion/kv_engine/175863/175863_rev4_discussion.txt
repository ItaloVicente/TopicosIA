DESCRIPTION:

MB-52276: Fix CheckpointCursor::getRemainingItemsCount

In previous pacthes Checkpoint::numItems has been changed from
accounting only non-meta items to accouting all items in the checkpoint
(empty item excluded).
After that change CheckpointCursor::getRemainingItemsCount() provides a
wrong/hybrid count of meta/non-meta items, so we fix that here.
With this patch "remaining items for cursor" accounts for all items
remaining, same as Checkpoint::numItems.
