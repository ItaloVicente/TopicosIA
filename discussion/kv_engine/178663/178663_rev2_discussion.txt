DESCRIPTION:

MB-52953: Use mutation_mem_threshold in ReplicationThrottleEP::hasSomeMemory

We are removing replication_throttle_threshold by extending the usage
of mutation_mem_threshold. This is the final step.

Tests are also converted to use mutation_mem_threshold.
replication_throttle_threshold is now unused and will be removed in a
follow-up change.
