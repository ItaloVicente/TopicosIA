DESCRIPTION:

MB-44452: Modify HashTableBench/Clear to delete Blob

To better model the typical usage of HashTable::clear (e.g. Bucket
Flush or Deletion), modify HashTableBench/Clear so each Blob is only
owned by the StoredValue (i.e no Item object remains in a vector
keeping the Blob alive).

This means that when StoredValue is deleted, then Blob will be also be
deleted and that is captured by the benchmark.

This unsurprisingly increaes the benchmark runtime to any results will
need to be re-baselined.
