DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Improve leb128 input checking

Before this change there were certain inputs which would
of decoded without error, but are invalid. E.g.

    0x8x.8x.8x.8x.8x.8x.8x.8x.8x.00  (10 bytes)

Passed into the uint32_t decode (which is what KV uses everywhere)
would of produced a result, however it is invalid input. The
decoder loop would of been shifting by greater than 32 for some
of the bytes (and ASAN complains about that, which lead to this
commit).

Really we want to treat such input as invalid, each leb128<T> has
a maximum length, each byte in the stream is  increasing in
magnitude for what it represents in the final value.

This patch uses the existing getMaxSize() constant to ensure that
the decode function only consumes up to the maximum number
of bytes, which is 5 for uint32_t. The buffer itself can still be
larger, but the decoder stops for a stop-byte or the max.

Simply put, if no-stop byte is found in the leb128 bytes, the
input is invalid and an exception or detectable error return
is produced.

Patch Set 1:

i should update protocol markdown with some of this, e.g. previously you could encode 0 (the default collection) using any number of bytes, non-canonical form. 0x80.<repeat-n>.0x00. The decoder would of been doing invalid shifts, but it was just shifting and or 0, and produced 0 with the .second buffer correctl pointing at the folowing data

We do allow non-canonical forms still (see tests), but capped by maxSize (i.e. 5bytes), e.g. 0 can be represented as 0x80.80.00 (should really be just be 1 byte of 0).

A second important note is that leb128 exists in mad-hatter (keys on disk/memory are collection prefixed), but we only ever used canonical forms, and only the reserved values, e.g. default collection and prepare namespace. If we were dumb enough to generate 100-byte leb prefixes and stik them on disk, ths would break, but our lebs are 1 byte :)

Line:117, include/mcbp/protocol/unsigned_leb128.h -> Is there a reason this code has been moved? Makes it much harder to understand what has changed when reviewing.
