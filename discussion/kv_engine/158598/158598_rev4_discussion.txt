DESCRIPTION:

MB-47604: Split KVStoreIFace::commit in two - delete me

To support AB testing we need to only run postCommitMakeStatsVisible()
once per flush (or we overcount stats in the VBucket). This is a
post-flush step so separate it from the rest of commit() so that
the ABKVStore can skip it.

Definitely not necessary now that we have two manifests, remove
