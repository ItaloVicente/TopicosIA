DESCRIPTION:

Remove test timeout from engine_testapp

engine_testapp had support for specifying a test timeout
by using -t command line option. Over the years it's
been modified and in it's current form it no longer works
as all it does is to set a variable we never check.

These days we run the automated builds under Jenkins
which monitors the timeout outside the binary so we
can just remove the code.
