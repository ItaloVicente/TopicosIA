DESCRIPTION:

MB-30552: Use tagging class UserDataView for username inside User

By changing the class used inside User.h and User.cc, we can
ensure that the user data will always be tagged and not have to
rely on the tagging to occur at the other end. This also allows
the removal of tagUserData as it is made obsolete. The seperate
class UserData controls the ownership of user data.

The two classes UserData and UserDataView could possibly be combined. The main deciding factor in this is whether to use String (which would copy) or const_char_buffer (which wouldn't as much). If we could discuss this tomorrow @Dave that would be great.

Line:61, utilities/logtags.h -> Can you check the formatting on this - I believe it's incorrect.

(If you haven't already, recommend installing the git-clang-format hook - see https://hub.internal.couchbase.com/confluence/display/cbeng/Using+the+git+clang-format+pre-commit+hook

Line:65, utilities/logtags.h -> Please add brief (single sentence) comments to all the new methods. You can skip the constructors and stream operator as they are standard.

Line:77, utilities/logtags.h -> Now you have the description of what to use this for, I'd probably drop this sentence (IMHO it's a little confusing...)

Line:81, utilities/logtags.h -> A const Rvalue-reference doesn't really make much sense. What's your reasoning for this?

Line:93, utilities/logtags.h -> There's still inconsistency in the naming between UserDataView and UserData.

Pick two method names for:
1.  accessing the data in the original, unsanitized form.
2. Accessing the data in a sanitized form

and use the same two names in each class.

Note that in connection.cc:449, tagUserData is still used for a getUsername(). This is because that specific getUsername links into connection.h and further, which uses a separate username instance. This should be converted into this type class in a future update.
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:415, daemon/cookie.cc -> In this case, true. It's essentially changing a line to do exactly the same, which isn't necessary in this commit.

Line:123, protocol/mcbp/libmcbp/dump.cc -> The addition of the << operator overload within the class simplifies this output with tags, so is linked to the extension of this class. tagUserData should become more an more obsolete as more user data is stored in an appropriate class, rather than relying on remembering to tag it at the end.

Line:61, utilities/logtags.h -> clang-format seems happy with it, and I get the warning "attribute 'visibility' is ignored, place it after "class" to apply attribute to type declaration" if placed above the class.
