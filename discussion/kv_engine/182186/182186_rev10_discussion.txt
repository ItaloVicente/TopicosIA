DESCRIPTION:

MB-54386: Allow for configuring a pool of "free" connections

Allow the administrator to configure a "pool" of connection objects
we want to try to keep available. If the number of connections
exceeds this number we'll try to shut down the least recently
used idle connection (which isn't an internal connection)

If the incoming rate of new connections is higher than we're
able to disconnect the least recently used connections we'll
end up hitting the hard limit where the new connection gets
dropped immediately.
