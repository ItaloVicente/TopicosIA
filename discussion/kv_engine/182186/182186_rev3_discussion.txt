DESCRIPTION:

MB-54386: Allow for configuring a pool of "free" connections

This patch adds (and maintains) a per-thread LRU of the
connections bound to the front end thread. It allows the
administrator to configure a "pool" of connection objects
we want to try to keep available. If the number of connections
exceeds this number we'll try to shut down the least recently
used idle connection (which isn't an internal connection)

If the incoming rate of new connections is higher than we're
able to disconnect the least recently used connections we'll
end up hitting the hard limit where the new connection gets
dropped immediately.

Blocking the dispatcher thread adds a bunch of new problems:
   1) The clock tick is also bound to this thread
   2) Reconfigure of network interface would hang
   3) Shutdown is also driven from this thread

We could "disable" the listen callback and enable it again
once we're getting below a threshold.

@todo Add unit test
@todo should we prioritize a given bucket
@todo the lru list should not be public from the connection ;)
