DESCRIPTION:

MB-53859: Support per-document compression at persistence in magma

Couchstore always snappy compresses items before persisting them, even
if they were stored uncompressed. Magma does not require this, as it
applies block-level compression at a later stage.

However, it is desired that KV track the total compressed data size as
a predictor of how much memory a dataset would require to be fully
resident (active compression).

A later improvement may use this compressed document to update the
HashTable, as a re-implementation of active compression for persistent
buckets which is not dependent on walking the HT.

This also has the benefit that bgfetched/warmed up documents start out
compressed, rather than initially taking more memory until the
compressor visits them.

To support these goals, add support for having magma compress
individual documents, consistent with couchstore.

Line:420, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_xdcr.cc -> Because couchstore doesn't change the datatype when compressing a doc, instead it does |= Snappy in `makeItemFromDocInfo` iff VALUES_COMPRESSED when _reading_.

For get_meta its KEYS_ONLY, so Snappy doesn't get added to the datatype (and the value isn't needed).

With this patch, magma modifies the datatype "on the way down" to disk, so get_meta finds that snappy _is_ set. Magma _could_ match couchstore by tracking "I compressed this" somewhere else without touching the datatype, but I'd avoided that for expediency - less worries about upgrade and where to put it and what not.

Line:3092, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> This is the fun aspect of VALUES_COMPRESSED vs VALUES_DECOMPRESSED and couchstore "knowing" if it compressed a doc - get defaults to VALUES_DECOMPRESSED, but couchstore doesn't decompress the read items _unless_ it was also the actor who _compressed_ them.

I.e., if you give it non-snappy and ask to read uncompressed you get non-snappy
if you give it snappy, and ask to read uncompressed you get snappy anyway.

when writing, meta decided here:

 CouchRequest::getContentMeta
 
    if (it.getNBytes() > 0 &&
        !cb::mcbp::datatype::is_snappy(it.getDataType())) {
        //Compress only if a value exists and is not already compressed
        rval |= COUCH_DOC_IS_COMPRESSED;
    }

when reading, whether to _decompress_ is requested here:

 CouchKVStore::fetchDoc
 
    const bool fetchCompressed = (filter == ValueFilter::VALUES_COMPRESSED);
    const couchstore_open_options openOptions =
            fetchCompressed ? 0 : DECOMPRESS_DOC_BODIES;

but is overriden here if couchstore didn't do the compression itself, because COUCH_DOC_IS_COMPRESSED wouldn't be set above:

 couchstore_open_doc_with_docinfo
 
    if (!(docinfo->content_meta & COUCH_DOC_IS_COMPRESSED)) {
       options &= ~DECOMPRESS_DOC_BODIES;
    }

So this test passed in the compressed=true case for couchstore because VALUES_DECOMPRESSED was "overriden", and the item still had datatype & Snappy.

The current impl for magma doesn't have the info to distinguish "was given snappy" vs "magma made this snappy" which would be required to exactly match couchstores behaviour, so would fail by returning a decompressed document with !Snappy.

changing couchstore semantics doesn't seem prudent to fix a stat under magma, and making magma match is a larger change to track the info somewhere, just to meet the observed behaviour of couchstore (even if it wasn't specifically the _intended_ behaviour).

Shortest path to passing tests which can still guard the intended code was to make it request compressed if it's going to expect a compressed datatype.

Line:1128, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> IIRC (I'll recheck), couchstore will return the datatype _as stored by KV_. So if given a snappy compressed document, and asked to read KEYS_ONLY, it will report snappy.

As elsewhere, magma doesn't currently distinguish "given snappy" from "I compressed this when persisting".

It's feeling like magma is going to have to recreate the couchstore behaviour if we think this quirk is being depended on... V2 metadata time?

Line:1710, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Added :vaultboy:

Line:1745, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Yes but no - 

if you store an document which is not made smaller by compression, currently magma stores the original doc. Couchstore will store the compressed doc, and notes that it compressed it in the doc meta (not the datatype).

If asked for VALUES_COMPRESSED, magma reads the doc, sees it's uncompressed, and returns it as-is.

couchstore reads the doc, sees it is compressed, and returns it as-is.

To make magma match the couchstore behaviour will need a new meta field to track "did magma compress this", and mandatory snappy even if it _increases_ the document size; given the number of places it's come up that's a bullet I'm growing more inclined to bite.

Line:1774, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Fixed

So primarily I think we should make the external behaviour of KV-Engine be as similar as possible for Couchstore and Magma (given now Magma /can/ compress values when they hit disk) - it's going to be a potential source of bugs / confusing behaviour if they behave differently with the same data.

Secondly, this sounds like a bug in Couchstore / CouchKVStore - or at the very least an efficiency - the client asked for the document to be uncompressed (which is cheaper for the bg thread to do than the FE as that would affect other connections' latency) - and hence the BG thread should uncompress it - it shouldn't matter who compressed it in the first place.

Agreed that this is achievable with a change in couchstore - the extra metadata _would_ be required to make magma match current couchstore, because without it we're throwing away information which is crucial to the current couchstore behaviour

On it (the couchstore change) :vaultboy:


... though, the couchstore change _could_ be a followup :philosoraptor:

Again, I think we have them have the same behaviour - either have Magma blindly compress it, or make Couchstore only compress if smaller.
