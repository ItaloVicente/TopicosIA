DESCRIPTION:

MB-53859: Support per-document compression at persistence in magma

Couchstore always snappy compresses items before persisting them, even
if they were stored uncompressed. Magma does not require this, as it
applies block-level compression at a later stage.

However, it is desired that KV track the total compressed data size as
a predictor of how much memory a dataset would require to be fully
resident (active compression).

A later improvement may use this compressed document to update the
HashTable, as a re-implementation of active compression for persistent
buckets which is not dependent on walking the HT.

This also has the benefit that bgfetched/warmed up documents start out
compressed, rather than initially taking more memory until the
compressor visits them.

To support these goals, add support for having magma compress
individual documents, consistent with couchstore.
