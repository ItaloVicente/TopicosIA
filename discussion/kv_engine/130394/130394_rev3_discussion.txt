DESCRIPTION:

MB-39594: Change VBucket::manifest container to F14map

Changing the VBucket::Manifest map from std::unordered_map to
folly::F14 is giving a small, but noticable 'operations per second'
improvement to collection tests that use many collections.

Result from 1000 collection, 50/50 r/w test:

7.0.0-2462:           3,077,285
toy with this change: 3,125,687

Line:78, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Not sure if it would make much of a difference but ManifestEntry looks like it has some holes in the struct due to layout - if you re-order I think you can save 8 Bytes.

Additionally if we can use a fixed value for "no expiration" instead of wrapping std::chrono::seconds in an optional, that would be another 8 Bytes I think. 


For a large number of collections that might help to reduce the memory footprint (and cache misses)

Line:78, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Some data:

ManifestEntry is currently 88 bytes.

Re-ordering everything so larger items first (all but scope are u64) we are still 88 bytes, presume trailing padding is forcing to 88 despite the re-order.

Next change, quick hack to make the maxTtl not optional got us to 80
