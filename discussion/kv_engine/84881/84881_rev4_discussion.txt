DESCRIPTION:

MB-266567: Don't over-count VBucket item counts

TODO: Check what happens in FE if an item is created and deleted in
the same flusher step - I believe the create will be de-duplicated
with the delete; so only the delete persistence callback will run. In
that case I think the item count may be incorrect - or at the very
least it may require newCacheItem to handle it correctly.
