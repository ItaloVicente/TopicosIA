Line:900, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> None of these would need a stringified version as they typically (with one exception) is in the range 0-15. and if they ever go really big you'd have a way bigger problem.... The "bytes" parameter could potentially go up in the MB range, but still don't need a strigify..

Line:908, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> why did we change this? The previous one would print it as:

    snappy,xattr

and now we're printing the numeric limit?

Line:353, protocol/connection/client_connection.cc -> Given that you've already created a method to add an int64 you could probably just use that?

Line:908, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> This was probably a mistake on my part, will revert back to the original :-)

Line:900, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> So the issue here is, all of these are size_t, and there is no cJSON API call which handles them hence the compiler warnings about data type conversion. Obviously we can't change the return type of things like .size(), so I think maybe the best thing to do here would be add another cJSON method which takes a size_t/uint64_t and adds it as a numerical value if it can, or stringifies it as per your previous suggestion?

Line:353, protocol/connection/client_connection.cc -> The reason I was doing this was because the method which adds an int_64 will silently narrow and can lead to data loss, keeping it this way means we don't experience this behaviour, and if we can't narrow 'val' then we just add it as a string

Line:900, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> For all of these I'd guess that your cJSON_AddInteger64ToObject would be enough.

If I where to do this I guess I would have just replaced the macro doing the cJSON_AddNumberToObject() with a function which accepts an integer and then take a look how many places we actually _do_ add double. I doubt that there is a lot of places compared to integers...
