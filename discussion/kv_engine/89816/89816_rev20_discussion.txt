Patch Set 20: Code-Review+2

(I still think it would have been better to fix cJSON_AddNumberToObject to accept a uint64_t and create a new method to add a double, as we don't really use a lot of floating points in our code.. that would most likely be a smaller diff and easier to maintain in the future (without having to upload a patch and see it fail on one of the builders and then figure out which version of the cjson things we want to call)

(I took a look at our code, and we never try to programatically add a double/float to our code, and we only "read" the doubles as part of our config validator code. To me it looks easier to just add a cJSON_Double in addition to the cJSON_Number and a separate method to create such objects... That would make all of the "dataloss" problems go away, and we don't need to think about if we want to print it as a string or not for integral values.)
