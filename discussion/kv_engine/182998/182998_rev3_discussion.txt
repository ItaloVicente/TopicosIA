DESCRIPTION:

MB-54666: Introduce the vbucket_history_retention_bytes config param

Max bytes of history an individual vbucket should aim to retain on
disk.
"0 bytes" means no history generated on a size-based manner.
Other configuration parameter (eg vbucket_history_retention_seconds)
might enable history independently.

Here:
- Add vbucket_history_retention_bytes param
- Make it dynamic
- Ensure validation/requirement rules apply to both static and dynamic
  configuration changes
- Expose param to the SetParam API
- Expose param to cbepctl
- Cache the param in KVBucket

Param not used in any production logic yet.
