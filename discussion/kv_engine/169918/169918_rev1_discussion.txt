Revert back to AtomicQueue to resolve.

Overriding Build Bot:

- The clang-format and clang-tidy failures are due to us restoring some older code which didn't meet the current standards when originally written. This code is functionally fine (and was present up until a few weeks ago in master branch).
- ASan/UBSan failure is known unrelated intermittent failure.
