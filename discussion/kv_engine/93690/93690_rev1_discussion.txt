DESCRIPTION:

MB-29480, MB-29512: Fail backfills that go below purge-seqno

If a backfill is requested and it is not a backfill of everything
the start must be below the purge-seqno, otherwise a DCP client
may miss deletions which have been purged.

This is achieved by loading the purgeSeqno into the ScanContext
and getting backfill create to abort (setting the stream as dead)

The initScanContext method will have opened the data file (and kept
it open) so that the purge-seqno used in the final check won't
change again.
