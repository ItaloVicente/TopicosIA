DESCRIPTION:

MB-30913: Add Scopes to VBucket Filters

Add the ability to filter a stream by scope.

A stream filtered by scope should include all collections, and
their assoicated system events, that belong to any given scope.
Adding a collection to a scope should add it to the filter,
and removing a collection should similarly remove it.

Line:231, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_filter.cc -> If systemEventsAllowed == false then the filter should be empty?

Line:251, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_filter.cc -> If this was a delete of the default collection, count will probably return 0 (i don't think we add default to the set, although we could)

However ::remove uses unordered_set::erase which returns how many items were removed (1 or 0) - https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_set/erase

We can modify remove() to return true/false to provide the existedBefore return value (rather than calling count)

Line:253, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_filter.cc -> nit: us

Line:303, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> processManifest can trigger a failure (see ::update) in that case we will abort set_collections however processManifest is now mutating the vbucket_manifest state

We really need to only update vbucket_manifest if we're going to apply the Manifest

Line:865, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> nit: for scope 2

Line:892, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> nit: comment could be clearer as to the expected collection

Line:231, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_filter.cc -> Yes, but default allowed will be true which remove then sets to false

Line:251, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_filter.cc -> Ahh cool! Done. Yeah default gets handled a bit differently, but I've left it as it is (bool and not included in the set). No need to change for this but would make things a little simpler if it was just a set element like other collections

Line:253, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_filter.cc -> Done

Line:303, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Might have gone overboard on the pairs of things... Could use a vector instead and address things by index if you think that would be clearer

Line:865, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> Done

Line:892, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> Done
