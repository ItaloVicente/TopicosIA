DESCRIPTION:

MB-39292: 2/n Add a 'SharedMetaDataTable'

To be able to correctly identify legal or illegal changes to a
collection's metadata we need a place to store and access
the metadata (primarily the name, but other metadata will be included).

To avoid unnecessary memory increases, we need a place in memory where
the VB::ManifestEntry objects will be able to reference the data. The
data will then be stored once per KVBucket.

This patch introduces a custom container type for the storage and
retrieval of the metadata to be associated with collections (and
scopes).

The intention is that the name, scope-id and ttl of a collection will
not be stored in the VB::ManifestEntry, but referenced (and
ref-counted).

This container deliberately does not make use of std::shared_ptr as
memory profiling during the development already highlights that
collections/scopes can give a noticeable increase to mem_used. A
version of this patch series which used std::shared_ptr resulted
in a net increase to VB::ManifestEntry (and the scopes map).
Although probably a fraction of a real deployment, keeping mem_used
increases low may help users evaluating (when vbuckets per node
could be high). The use of a plain reference achieves a net reduction
in the VB::ManifestEntry (see patch 3/n).  As VB::Manifest and
VB::ManifestEntry are tightly coupled it isn't too problematic to
use a reference and explicit calls to reference and dereference the
shared metadata.

The container uses a multimap for storage because we need to support
the possibility that different id->meta mappings could exist.

* vbucket 0 has collection:x with name:fruit
* vbucket 1 has collection:x with name:vegetable

This can happen in failure circumstances when the vbuckets see
different state time-lines (which is intended to be force corrected).

Note the SharedMetaDataTable will be used by VB::Manifest for scope
name storage too, hence the full templating of key and value allow
the container to be reused.
