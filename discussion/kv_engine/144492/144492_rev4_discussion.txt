DESCRIPTION:

MB-39292: 2/n Add a 'SharedMetaDataTable'

To be able to correctly identify legal or illegal changes to a
collection's metadata we need a location to store and access
the metadata (primarily the name, but other metadata will be included).

To avoid unnecessary memory increases, we need a place in memory where
the VB::ManifestEntry objects will be able to 'reference' the and not
own it.

This patch introduces a custom container type for the storage and
retrieval of the metadata to be associated with collections (and
scopes).

The intention is that the name, scope-id and ttl of a collection will
not be stored in the VB::ManifestEntry, but referenced.

This container deliberately does not make use of std::shared_ptr as
memory profiling during the development already highlights that
collections/scopes can give a noticeable increase to mem_used. With
shared_ptr holding two pointers and a desire to decrease the
collections mem_used foot-print the container uses our own
SingleThreadedRCPtr. The use of SingleThreadedRCPtr allows
VB::ManifestEntry to reduce in-size by scope-id/ttl, benefit from
the later inclusion of the name and only then increase by 1 pointer.
This result in a net reduction memory required to store each
vbucket's collection data.

The container uses a multimap for storage because we need to support
the possibility that different id->meta mappings are permitted.

E.g.
* vbucket 0 has collection:x with name:fruit
* vbucket 1 has collection:x with name:vegetable

This can happen in failure circumstances when the vbuckets see
different state time-lines (which is intended to be later force
corrected).

Note the SharedMetaDataTable will be used by VB::Manifest for scope
name storage too, hence the full templating of key and value allow
the container to be reused.

Line:88, engines/ep/src/collections/shared_metadata_table.h -> Not sure this API is the best choice now we are using ref-counted ptr, given the RCPtr object itself will manage reference counts and trigger the dtor of the Value when it reaches zero. Do we actually need this method at all now?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:88, engines/ep/src/collections/shared_metadata_table.h -> Makes sense.

If we supported weak ownership with STRCPtr, I think that would (mostly) automatically handle it; given the actual owned object (Manifest?) would be deleted on last strong owner. We'd still have the actual element in the map + the shared_ptr control block; but that would probably be livable with - assuing the next time the metadata table is updated it would be cleaned up.

How much does a full-on std::shared_ptr actually cost us here? I believe it's only going to be ~2 words per item in the SharedMetaDataTable, i.e. 32Bytes per collection (across all vbuckets). An upper limit of 32.000Bytes per bucket assuming 1000 collections doesn't sound _that_ bad...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:88, engines/ep/src/collections/shared_metadata_table.h -> I think we do, there has to be some way to get the table's multimap to erase stale items.

This container is destined to store *all* of the collection-id to meta mappings. Overtime calls to createOrRefernce populate the map, and begin returning new data or reused data, over time a collection X in vb:0..n all refer to the same object. T

without making this call, as collections come and go (and so do vbuckets) the container begins to gather stale data (with it being the only owner), so deference is the trigger for the container to check "am i the sole owner" and then erase if so.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:88, engines/ep/src/collections/shared_metadata_table.h -> It wasn't the sizeof this table I was concerned with, it's the resulting sizeof VB::ManifestEntry (which in general i was trying to shrink down), and that object is 1 per collection per VB, then we have the scope map which also needs a similar pattern, again 1 per scope per VB. It all became quite noticable when deploying the max config, and even going from 88 bytes for VB::ManifestEntry (current) to 72 (this patch series with STRCPtr) it could be seen. Switching to shared_ptr keeps us at 88, but I like the 72
