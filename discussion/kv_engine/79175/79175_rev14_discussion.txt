DESCRIPTION:

Use cbsocket wrapping library to allow for logging

cbsocket provides a BSD socket interface which (by default)
wraps directly into the corresponding socket call. It may however
be put in a mode where all socket operations would be written to
a log file.

One tool doesn't eliminate the need for another tool... The "close hook" allow me to look at the network traffic as part of shutting down the connection. Yes, one could always create a TCP dump and open wireshark to do filtering, but if I'm searching for something which happens very inferequently  can keep this code running for weeks and it'll drop (and release) the data which isn't interesting. you can't normally run a full tcpdump capture for 24 hours when trying to reproduce a situation...

Note tcpdump does support a rotating buffer (-W). 

Agreed, one tool doesn't necessarily eliminate the need for another; but if one tool is a superset of the other (or sufficiently close) then it often does.

If you think this is of sufficient value to outweigh the cost of maintaining it then I'm ok with you putting it in, but personally I don't think it's worth it.
