Line:75, engines/ep/src/vb_filter.h -> I take it this is unused? It might be nice to keep it anyway as it's part of a set of operations. If we felt cheeky we could add a test just to confirm all the filter_* methods work and give it a usage :P

I guess it could just be re-added later if it is used, but then either someone needs to know it was removed to bring it back or they'd just re-implement it which is a little dev-time-inefficient if we already have it here.

Line:147, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> This seems curious as well - ACTIVE and REPLICA might be unused but we might want the full set for consistency, they'd just need to be re-added if needed otherwise.

Plus this adds the moment of "oh, are active and replica not used like this for a reason? <small rabbit hole> Ah, no it's fine to do that" if someone does find they need ACTIVE but it isn't there.

Line:2305, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I see that this is the only usage of state, but the comment suggests repeatedly reading the state would be not good™. Having state already declared might help someone in the future avoid introducing a bug, or at least the comment gives a hint to be aware that calling getState() again could cause issues. Though of course it doesn't _prevent_ the potential bug.

Line:179, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> I know this is a clang tidy commit, but it's recommended that the move ones be declared too (rule of 5) https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c21-if-you-define-or-delete-any-copy-move-or-destructor-function-define-or-delete-them-all
