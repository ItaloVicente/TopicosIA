DESCRIPTION:

MB-55173: add kv_conflicts_resolved metric

Exposes the number of set with meta/del with meta ops which required
conflict resolution, broken down by the result.

The possible results are:

* The incoming mutation was accepted
* The incoming mutation was rejected as it is "older"/"behind"
  as decided by the chosen conflict resolution method
* The incoming mutation was rejected as it appears to be
  identical to the existing value, based on:
  cas, revSeqno, Expiry time, flags, xattr datatype
  (as these are the fields conflict resolution considers)

Example metrics exposed for Prometheus:

 kv_conflicts_resolved{bucket="default",op="set",result="accepted"} 478.000000 1676471117000
 kv_conflicts_resolved{bucket="default",op="del",result="accepted"} 2824.000000 1676471117000
 kv_conflicts_resolved{bucket="default",op="set",result="rejected_behind"} 4103.000000 1676471117000
 kv_conflicts_resolved{bucket="default",op="del",result="rejected_behind"} 6026.000000 1676471117000
 kv_conflicts_resolved{bucket="default",op="set",result="rejected_identical"} 503.000000 1676471117000
 kv_conflicts_resolved{bucket="default",op="del",result="rejected_identical"} 7515.000000 1676471117000
