DESCRIPTION:

MB-43550 Get specific stats in bulk from KVBucket, KVStore

Currently we gather kvstore stats for engine stats reporting by calling
KVStore individually for each stat. This is inefficient for MagmaKVStore
since for every such call, it fetches all its stats and only returns the
one asked for. It has to do this because Magma only supports getting all
stats at once and has no provision to get individual stats.

To help with such cases, this change adds a method to KVBucket and
KVStore to get specific stats in bulk.

Line:394, engines/ep/src/kvstore.cc -> Ah - so string_view isn't guaranteed to be null-terminated; which means it's not safe to call .data() and pass to something taking `const char*`.

I see two options:

1) change the various std::string_view to `const char*`, or 
2) change getStat (and possibly some code under it) to take std::string_view.

1) is the simpler option and technically given we never need sub-strings or similar is sufficient for the current use-case 2) is arguably a nicer, more flexible API, but it's even more feature-creep on this patch. 

I'll let you decide, but if (2) ends up quite large you might want to split into it's own patch beforehand.

Line:2386, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Not sure this is going to work / be safe in the general-case. gsl::span is non-owning (it's basically just a pointer and a size internally), so you don't have the ability to modify it - including rearranging items.

If you need to sort I think you need to create your own storage here - which somewhat negates the other changes made to minimise temporaries etc. Given theres's only ~30 or so actual stats it might be fine to just perform a liner search of `keys` then checking if the user requested that key.

Line:394, engines/ep/src/kvstore.cc -> Good catch! 

Let's go ahead with the 2nd suggestion. Another benefit would be in faster string comparisons. Since string_view knows its size, it can terminate quickly if the other string doesn't equal its size.

Here you go: http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/144764

Line:2386, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> > so you don't have the ability to modify it - including rearranging items

I think gsl::span allows for modification of the elements since operator[], data() return non-const references? Sorting using such a mutable view seems fine, just like old C style qsort would work with base pointer and size? Also the iterators meet std::sort requirements.

> If you need to sort I think you need to create your own storage here - which somewhat negates the other changes made to minimise temporaries

Good point. Though I believe std::sort (implemented as IntroSort) is in-place not needing any dynamic allocations.

> Given theres's only ~30 or so actual stats it might be fine to just perform a liner search of `keys` then checking if the user requested that key.

Sure, will remove the sorting. I was in two minds, but wondered if sorting routines have special handling for smaller array sizes, it might be beneficial.

Sorting using such a mutable view seems fine, just like old C style qsort would work with base pointer and size? Also the iterators meet std::sort requirements.

You're correct, gsl::span (and std::span) does allow modification in general, but in our use-case here we cannot assume modification is allowed - the actual sequence of  strings could be read-only; for example something like:

 constexpr std::array<std::string_view, N> = {...};

Could end up in read-only memory in the binary. As such, we should ideally change the argument type to gsl::span<const std::string_view>
