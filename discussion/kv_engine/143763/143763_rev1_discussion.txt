DESCRIPTION:

Add method to get specified stats in bulk from KVBucket, KVStore

Currently we gather kvstore stats for engine stats by calling KVStore
individually for each stat. This is inefficient for MagmaKVStore since
for every such call, it fetches all its stats and only returns the one
asked for. It has to do this because Magma only supports getting all
stats at once and has no provision to get individual stats.

To help with such cases, this change adds a method to KVBucket and
KVStore to get specified stats in bulk. This will be used in near future
when we add Magma stats to engine stats.
