Line:21, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Not sure you need this now if you're using chrono.

Line:193, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Style: Meaningless to use `const` on a pass-by-value argument.

Line:266, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Bit nasty this causes us to pull in unordered_set (and exposes extra test-only interface). Can you not do this with a mock class which inherits?

Line:21, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> again, I don't think you need this now.

Line:21, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Done

Line:193, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Meaningless from the caller PoV, useful to prevent the implementation code from accidentally changing that value.
But fine to remove the const if that's considered the preferred style in KV.

Line:266, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> That's what I would do, but the inner tracked-list contains objects of type SyncWrite, which is defined in durability_monitor.cc and only forward-declared in durability_monitor.h.
So for doing that I would need to move the definition of SyncWrite into the header.
So far I prevented exposing DM's internal data-types to the public interface..

Line:21, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Done
