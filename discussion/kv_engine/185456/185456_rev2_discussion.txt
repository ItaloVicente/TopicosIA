DESCRIPTION:

MB-55251: Always deduplicate if no retention window configured

Both in memory (Checkpoint) and at persistence (Flusher).
That avoids that we unnecessarily process and persist to disk mutations
that would be discarded at magma as soon as compaction runs.

Change-Id: I259d1c2f257f643a2fb8daa93b41fd67e3663f0b
