DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: Add "history" key to Collection's Manifest

Adds a new boolean member to the Scope/Collection objects of
the manifest.

With this commit the value is now accepted in the manifest and becomes
readable via Manifest and VB::Manifest but it does not yet affect any
actual deduplication/history retention.
