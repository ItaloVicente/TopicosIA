DESCRIPTION:

MB-31581: Fix incorrect formatting of 'vbucket-seqno' stats

As part of the Vbid refactoring (MB-30552), VBucket::getId()'s return
type was changed from uint16_t to the strong type Vbid. However,
EventuallyPersistentEngine::addSeqnoVbStats() was not updated to
extract the raw uint16_t from the Vbid when printing. When building in
Debug mode, this results in a corrupt vbid - for example see the
following test failure:

    [ RUN      ] StatTest.vbucket_seqno_stats_test
    ../kv_engine/engines/ep/tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc:96: Failure
    Value of: vals
    Expected: has 7 elements and there exists some permutation of elements such that:
     - element #0 has a key that is equal to "vb_0:uuid", and
     - element #1 has a first field that is equal to "vb_0:high_seqno", and has a second field that is equal to "0", and
     - element #2 has a first field that is equal to "vb_0:abs_high_seqno", and has a second field that is equal to "0", and
     - element #3 has a first field that is equal to "vb_0:last_persisted_seqno", and has a second field that is equal to "0", and
     - element #4 has a first field that is equal to "vb_0:purge_seqno", and has a second field that is equal to "0", and
     - element #5 has a first field that is equal to "vb_0:last_persisted_snap_start", and has a second field that is equal to "0", and
     - element #6 has a first field that is equal to "vb_0:last_persisted_snap_end", and has a second field that is equal to "0"
      Actual: { ("vb_0:high_seqno", "0"),
                ("vb_0:last_persisted_snap_start", "0"),
                ("vb_258146304:abs_high_seqno", "0"),
                ("vb_258146304:last_persisted_seqno", "0"),
                ("vb_258146304:last_persisted_snap_end", "0"),
                ("vb_258146304:purge_seqno", "0"),
                ("vb_258146304:uuid", "87176786588641") }
    [  FAILED  ] StatTest.vbucket_seqno_stats_test (4 ms)

Note this doesn't manifest under a release build (hence CV passing) -
mostly likely because the address of the raw uint16_t is the same as
the Vbid object itself; and the optimizer effectively hides the bug.

Fix by adding the missing .get() call.
