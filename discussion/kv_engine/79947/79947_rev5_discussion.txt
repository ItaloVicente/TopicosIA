DESCRIPTION:

MB-24983: Don't prune when an item as no value

It is possible for an item to have no value.  Therefore when we are
performing pruning we need to first check that it has a value
(i.e data and/or xattrs).

Line:331, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> Sorry - I left these changes, as they were a result of me running format on the code, and it highlighted some places where I must have got the formatting wrong originally so I thought is was worth keeping these changes.  However I have undone them so the code change is now much smaller.

Line:331, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> My preferred rule of thumb here is to only reformat lines which are getting touched already - and as such you're not making the patch any larger / adding whitespace-only changes to the history.

Having said that, `clang-format` will generally reformat the paragraph which is touched, so sometimes the extent is slightly more than the lines touched. However in this case these are well outside the touched paragraphs, hence asking to revert.

Hope that makes sense.
