DESCRIPTION:

MB-36372: 3/4 Return durability ambiguous when set state away from active

One cause of the issue is that a transition to replica is can leave
connections waiting for resolution of a sync-write. Address this cause
by ensuring that connections waiting for sync-writes to complete are
notified with durability ambiguous.
