DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor] Create standalone unit test for GetRandomKey

There is something "strange" with the implementation of GetRandomKey
on the server as it seems to be a delay until the key gets available
after being stored on the server.

After storing a document you may immediately fetch it through a
call with get, but that doesn't seem to be the case with GetRandomKey
as I had to add a few retries until it got available.
