DESCRIPTION:

MB-30302: Correct ep-engine_ep_unit_tests and remove old Logger class

Correct an issue in ep-engine_ep_unit_tests caused by creating
blackhole loggers instead of console loggers, and not correctly
setting the log levels. The BucketLogger class should store a
global log level, similar to that of the old log class, to do so.

Remove the old Logger class in EP Engine now that is no longer
necessary.

Remove the old logger descriptor and log level now that they are
no longer necessary.

Correct an issue with some log messages created in a recent patch
that prints LOG ERROR due to incorrect formatting (a '{' that is not
escaped).

There's quite a mix of things in this patch - I suggest you split it up into individual patches for each of the chunks of work - maybe:

* Fix to ep-engine_ep_unit_tests logging (so for example other team-members can get cherry pick and get the logging working; while the other changes are prepped)
* Misc fixes to log formatting
* Removal of old logger; final migration of enums etc.
Line:94, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> not be?

Line:95, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> Do we actually need an extra variable? Can't we just update the globalBucketLogger's own level argument in the callback above?

Line:61, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/ep_unit_tests_main.cc -> I think you can drop this (and just create the console one) - if we actually do have any critical log messages when setting up the mock; it's probably worth seeing those.

Line:1640, engines/ewouldblock_engine/ewouldblock_engine.cc -> Given you're here suggest bumping this up to critical; given if we failed to create the engine we won't get far (and it's worth printing by default).

Line:402, engines/nobucket/nobucket.cc -> as previous
