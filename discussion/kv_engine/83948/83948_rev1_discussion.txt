DESCRIPTION:

Use std::atomic::compare_exchange_strong for changing audit

Earlier we had log entries like:

Audit changed from: disabled to: disabled
Audit descriptor 20480 changed from: disabled to: enabled
Audit descriptor 20481 changed from: disabled to: enabled
Audit descriptor 20482 changed from: disabled to: enabled
Audit descriptor 20483 changed from: disabled to: enabled
Audit descriptor 20484 changed from: disabled to: enabled
Audit descriptor 20485 changed from: disabled to: disabled
Audit descriptor 20486 changed from: disabled to: enabled
Audit descriptor 20487 changed from: disabled to: enabled
Audit descriptor 20488 changed from: disabled to: disabled
Audit descriptor 20489 changed from: disabled to: disabled
Audit descriptor 20490 changed from: disabled to: disabled
Audit descriptor 20491 changed from: disabled to: disabled

Due to the fact that we unconditionally logged and changed
the variable. This could easily be fixed by using existing
features provided by the atomics.
