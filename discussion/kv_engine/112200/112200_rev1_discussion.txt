DESCRIPTION:

MB-35096: Restore tests checking seqnoAck above lastTrackedWrite

Add back tests covering seqnoAck above lastTrackedWrite, but now expect
that the seqnoAck *will* be allowed, as the upper bound for seqnoAcks
is now the last sent seqno, checked in the DcpProducer. Tests for that
check were added in an earlier patch.
