DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117, MB-33077 [SR]: DM tracks StoredValue in place of queued_item

So far the DurabilityMonitor used to store a RefCount'ed queued_item for
every Pending SyncWrite tracked.

But, by doing that we have a RefCount'ed Blob alive even when the
StoredValue has been value-ejected, which prevents memory from being
freed.

Note that the current behaviour is equivalent (in terms of memory
management) to completely skipping Pendings at ejection, which is
something we don't want.

So, with this pacth we stop with storing queued_items into the
DurabilityMonitors.
