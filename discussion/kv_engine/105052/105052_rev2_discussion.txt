DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117, MB-33077 [SR]: DM tracks StoredValue in place of queued_item

So far the DurabilityMonitor used to store a RefCount'ed queued_item for
every Pending SyncWrite tracked.

But, by doing that we have a RefCount'ed Blob alive even when the
StoredValue has been value-ejected, which prevents memory from being
freed.

Note that the current behaviour is equivalent (in terms of memory
management) to completely skipping Pendings at ejection, which is
something we don't want.

So, with this pacth the DurabilityMonitor tracks StoredValue (reference)
rather than queued_item (RefCount'ed). Note that from
http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/105047/ we ensure that the Key and
Metadata for a Pending are always resident, so StoredValues referenced
by the DurabilityMonitor are valid by logic.
