DESCRIPTION:

Migrate to waitForPredicate from platform

waitForPredicate() et al have been added to platform so they can be
more widely used. Update all uses of waitForPredicate and
decayingSleep to use the new cb:: namespaced one, simplifying code
where possible to use waitForPredicate() instead of manually calling
decayingSleep.
