DESCRIPTION:

RocksDB: Implement RocksDBKVStore::scan basics

Lays the initial groundwork for iterating all keys by seqno.

At the moment, the ColumnFamily mapping seqno=>key will grow forever; we
do not ever remove old mappings. This could be done in a compaction
filter, or a periodic task etc. The main costs currently are slower
scans as time is wasted ignoring seqno=>key mappings where the seqno is
no longer current, and ever growing storage usage.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> I guess at present one must only select the highest seqno-> key mapping; as older ones are stale?

Line:660, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Crappy API (I know it existed before you got here) - should just pass a reference!

Line:675, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> unique_ptr

Line:706, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Trying to think how this works for stale seqnos - for example we have the following mutations (seqno -> Key)

 1, A
 2, B
 3, A

If a client asks for a backfill from 0->INF; we should only return seqnos 2 and 3. Is this handled correctly?

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Indeed - currently scan selects the seqno=>key entry which matches the seqno in the item, if it exists - quite inefficient as it is doing a get for an item for every seqno, to check if this is the current seqno.

IIRC, iterators do keep a consistent view of the DB, so I *think* this will be functionally correct...

Line:660, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Aye :P

Line:706, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Yes - not in the nicest of manners currently - see below around

if (itm->getBySeqno() != seqno)

- we have already fetched the item, and it exists, so we check that the seqno matches the seqno=>key entry the iterator is currently on, if so we are on the latest entry for this key, and can proceed.

That is, we skip a seqno=>key if the key=>item is not present, or the item has a different seqno now.

This is probably terrible efficiency-wise, as this is a get for every single seqno=>key, including the stale ones.
in your example,

iterator at 1=>A
 get A, it exists
 itm->getBySeqno()!=1 - skip!
..
iterator at 3=>A
 get A, it exists
 itm->getBySeqno()==3, proceed!

Line:719, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> As a sanity-check you verify the seqno from the index isn't greater than the one found in the Document - as that would imply the index was updated without the Document.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:719, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Done - with a corresponding addition to the seqno mapping commit to delete the mappings in delVBucket
