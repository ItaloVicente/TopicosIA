DESCRIPTION:

MB-47460: Correctly handle replay of collection drop + doc shrink

During compaction, if mutations were flushed concurrently requiring a
compaction replay, then if a collection has a doucment's value shrink
and the collection is dropped the diskSize stat would go negative,
resulting in an exception being thrown and compaction being aborted:

    WARNING (GleamBookUsers0) CouchKVStore::replayPrecommitHook failed saveCollectionStats what:ThrowExceptionUnderflowPolicy current:0 arg:-1061
    ERROR (GleamBookUsers0) CouchKVStore::compactDB: exception while performing compaction for vb:0 - Details: cb::couchstore::replay() - precommit hook Failed: error cancel

The issue is that the local collection cardinality doc (|<CID>|) is
not alive during this replay batch (as the collection has been
dropped), hence when the replayPreCopyHook is passed the mutation
which reduces the value size, we record a negative diskSize in
StatisticsUpdate for the affected collection.

Later in CouchKVStore::replayPrecommitHook when
FlushAccounting::forEachCollection is called to calculate new local
docs to write to disk, we attempt to construct a PersistedStats with a
negative diskSize; which isn't permitted (given it's a
NonNegativeCounter) and hence an exception is thrown, and compaciton
aborted.

Note this issue appears relatively benign - while this compaction is
aborted, a subsequent compaction will process the collection drop in
the initial compaction phase and hence the negative diskSize code path
isn't run.

Solution

When the system event encoding the collection drop is replayed (in
seqno order), add it to the set of droppedCollections in this
FlushAccounting. Then later in FlushAccounting::forEachCollection,
skip any updates for collections which are present in
droppedCollections.

Line:166, engines/ep/src/collections/flush_accounting.cc -> Do we ever hit this? I suspect we don't because we should generally have the collection start on disk to consider this an update rather than an insert. It could probably happen on a replica though if it just received a collection drop (tombstone) and neither the start nor any of the items so probably worth testing.

Line:203, engines/ep/src/collections/flush_accounting.cc -> I don't think we need one

Line:370, engines/ep/src/collections/flush_accounting.cc -> probably worth a "why" comment

Line:166, engines/ep/src/collections/flush_accounting.cc -> This (the insert variant) is the case I hit with the current unit-test - because `di` is null. This is possibly due to me testing with the default collection, which IIRC doesn't have a create event on disk.

I'll modify the test to use a different collection and re-check - but we probably need both cases; to handle default.

Line:203, engines/ep/src/collections/flush_accounting.cc -> As per above comment, might hit this with non-default collection; will confirm.

Line:370, engines/ep/src/collections/flush_accounting.cc -> It's the same reason as the above check for droppedInStore; maybe I'll pull them into the same paragraph?

I've spotted the issue, it's quite subtle and a clear lack of test coverage (which your test now adds).

I was looking at your test, and I knew we had some code which *should* mean your test works, but clearly it hits an error.

The following code is of interest

http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kvstore/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc#1885-1900

Here my expectation was that the droppedCollection vector loaded at line 1885 should contain the collection dropped in the pre-hook, but clearly it isn't...

The problem is because we've used couchstore::seek before this call and we cannot see the changes made by the flushes in the pre-hook.

Moving 

http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kvstore/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc#1885-1892

To here

http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kvstore/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc#1854

Should fix, i.e. after we've seeked to the end of the source, that way FlushAccounting should get populated with the newly flushed metadata from the source
