DESCRIPTION:

MB-47460: Correctly handle replay of collection drop + doc shrink

During compaction, if mutations were flushed concurrently requiring a
compaction replay, then if a collection has a doucment's value shrink
and the collection is dropped the diskSize stat would go negative,
resulting in an exception being thrown and compaction being aborted:

    WARNING (GleamBookUsers0) CouchKVStore::replayPrecommitHook failed saveCollectionStats what:ThrowExceptionUnderflowPolicy current:0 arg:-1061
    ERROR (GleamBookUsers0) CouchKVStore::compactDB: exception while performing compaction for vb:0 - Details: cb::couchstore::replay() - precommit hook Failed: error cancel

The issue is that the local collection cardinality doc (|<CID>|) is
not alive during this replay batch (as the collection has been
dropped), hence when the replayPreCopyHook is passed the mutation
which reduces the value size, we record a negative diskSize in
StatisticsUpdate for the affected collection.

Later in CouchKVStore::replayPrecommitHook when
FlushAccounting::forEachCollection is called to calculate new local
docs to write to disk, we attempt to construct a PersistedStats with a
negative diskSize; which isn't permitted (given it's a
NonNegativeCounter) and hence an exception is thrown, and compaciton
aborted.

Note this issue appears relatively benign - while this compaction is
aborted, a subsequent compaction will process the collection drop in
the initial compaction phase and hence the negative diskSize code path
isn't run.

Solution

The bug is in tryToCatchUpDbFile() - we read the dropped collections
from the source Db too late, after we have seeked back to the original
header. As such the changes made in the pre-hook are not observed.

By hoisting the read of the collections earlier we observe all dropped
collections - including the ones dropped during this iteration.

Patch Set 2:

Note this fails the check were the local collection stats docs shouldn't be present (or if they are should have zeros for all values).

However it _does_ correctly record the collections which have been dropped (_local/collections/dropped) and this is read correctly.
