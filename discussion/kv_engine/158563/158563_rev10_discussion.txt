DESCRIPTION:

MB-47460: Correctly handle replay of collection drop + doc size decrease

During compaction and when the flusher runs concurrently (triggering a
replay) where the changes copied during replay:

(1) Includes mutations that replace a document and decrease its size
(2) Where the documents of (1) are to a collection that is also
    subsequently dropped in the replay.

The diskSize stat of the dropped collection is then allowed to go
negative resulting in an exception being thrown and compaction being
aborted:

    WARNING (GleamBookUsers0) CouchKVStore::replayPrecommitHook failed saveCollectionStats what:ThrowExceptionUnderflowPolicy current:0 arg:-1061
    ERROR (GleamBookUsers0) CouchKVStore::compactDB: exception while performing compaction for vb:0 - Details: cb::couchstore::replay() - precommit hook Failed: error cancel

The issue is that the local collection cardinality doc (|<CID>|) is
not alive during this replay batch (as the collection has been
dropped), hence when the replayPreCopyHook is passed the mutation
which reduces the value size, we record a negative diskSize in
StatisticsUpdate for the affected collection.

Later in CouchKVStore::replayPrecommitHook when
FlushAccounting::forEachCollection is called to calculate new local
docs to write to disk, we attempt to construct a PersistedStats with a
negative diskSize; which isn't permitted (given it's a
NonNegativeCounter) and hence an exception is thrown, and compaction
aborted.

Note this issue appears relatively benign - while this compaction is
aborted, a subsequent compaction will process the collection drop in
the initial compaction phase and hence the negative diskSize code path
isn't run.

Solution

The bug is in tryToCatchUpDbFile() - we read the dropped collections
from the source Db too late, after we have seeked back to the original
header. As such the vbucket metadata changes (critically the fact the
collection is dropped) made in the pre-hook are not observed allowing
the negative size to be computed.

By hoisting the read of the collections earlier we observe all dropped
collections - including the ones dropped during this iteration.
