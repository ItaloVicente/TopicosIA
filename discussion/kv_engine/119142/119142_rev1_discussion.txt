DESCRIPTION:

MB-37161: Check if SyncRepl enabled after DCP Control negoatiation complete

When processing a SnapshotMarker from a Producer which doesn't support
SyncReplication, we must set the HCS to zero. To determine if SyncRepl
is enabled, the PassiveStream checks the Consumer's SyncRepl
negotiation status in the PassiveStreeam ctor.

However, this incorrectly assumes that DCP control negotiation has
been completed by the time the PassiveStream object is created. This
isn't the case, as ns_server asynchronously sends AddStream requests
to the Consumer, potentially before the Consumer has completed feature
negotiation with the Producer. As a result, PassiveStream objects can
be created before SyncReplicaiton has been negotiated, and
PassiveStream::supportsSyncReplication is incorrectly false.

Fix this by deferring setting PassiveStream::supportsSyncReplication
until acceptStream() - which can only be called /after/ DCP Control
has been completed - due to the Consumer step() order:

    1. Negotiate DCP control features with Producer.
    2. Send StreamRequest message(s) to Producer

Only after (2) are any StreamRequestResponse message received by the
Consumer, and it is those which result in acceptStream() being called.
