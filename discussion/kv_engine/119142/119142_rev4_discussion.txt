DESCRIPTION:

MB-37161: Check if SyncRepl enabled after DCP Control negoatiation complete

When processing a SnapshotMarker from a Producer which doesn't support
SyncReplication, we must set the HCS to zero. To determine if SyncRepl
is enabled, the PassiveStream checks the Consumer's SyncRepl
negotiation status in the PassiveStreeam ctor.

However, as MB-37204 highlighted, this incorrectly assumes that DCP
control negotiation has been completed by the time the PassiveStream
object is created. This isn't the case, as ns_server asynchronously
sends AddStream requests to the Consumer, potentially before the
Consumer has completed feature negotiation with the Producer. As a
result, PassiveStream objects can be created before SyncReplicaiton
has been negotiated, and PassiveStream::supportsSyncReplication is
incorrectly false.

Fix this by deferring setting PassiveStream::supportsSyncReplication
until acceptStream() - which can only be called /after/ DCP Control
has been completed - due to the Consumer step() order:

    1. Negotiate DCP control features with Producer.
    2. Send StreamRequest message(s) to Producer

Only after (2) are any StreamRequestResponse message received by the
Consumer, and it is those which result in acceptStream() being called.
