DESCRIPTION:

MB-35415: Change Connection::datatype to be atomic

The TSAN output demonstrates that we have unlocked reads of
the Connection::datatype 'bitset' from various threads.

For example the ep-engine backfill thread calls into
the ActiveStream which then queries what datatypes are
enabled by the DCP connection, this results in a read
of datatype with no locks held (or unrelated locks held).

Changing the datatype to be std::atomic allows for safe write
read by our threads.
