DESCRIPTION:

Simplify DCP handling in the core

This patch marks the connection as a DCP connection as part of
DCP Open instead of delaying that until the first Add Stream
or Stream Request.

Future refactoring of the core needs this in order to correctly
identify DCP connections as part of notify_io_complete (test
that the cookie is in a blocked state when it is notified, and
that's not true for DCP connections).
