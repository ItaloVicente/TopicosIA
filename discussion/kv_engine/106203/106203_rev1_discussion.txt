DESCRIPTION:

HashTableBench: Recalibrate and improve

- Modify Insert() benchmark to only clear the HashTable when all
  threads are paused; so we don't inadvertantly measure the time spent
  waiting on clear() - which has to acquire all mutexes.

- Modify Delete() in a similar way - only re-populate when all threads
  are paused.

- Shrink key names so they are under ~20 bytes and hence fit in the
  small-string-optimization inline storage (mainly to just make the
  benchmark setup faster).

- Fix the Iterations to the number of items in the test set, to ensure
  that we test all data points. Helps stabilize test results (given a
  larger number of items will likely cache miss more).

- Add extra variant of Find which tests performance of findForWrite().

- (Optionally) add a percentage of extra Prepared SyncWrite Items, to
  measure any impact their presence have on find() performance. Use
  this in FindForRead & FindForWrite.

- Record the number of items processed so the benchmark results
  include item/s (makes easier to track in CBNT).

As a result of these changes we can bump the item / iteration count by
10x to 100,000 and still run each benchmark in ~1s:

Comments on above results:

- interesting that FindForRead seems ~20% slower than FindForWrite -
  this is due tot he fact that findforRead() updates the frequency
  counter (TrackReference::Yes) by default; whereas findForWrite()
  doesn't (any update of freq counter happens later when the
  StoredValue is actually updated).
