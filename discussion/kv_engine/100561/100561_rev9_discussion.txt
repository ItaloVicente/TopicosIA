DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Introduce usage of Expiration event for DCP

This commit introduces implementation of Expiration event within
DCP, which in turn triggers the Expiration code path instead of
the deletion path.
This also implements the ability to output an expiry opcode, as
demonstrated by the test included in this patch.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:218, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> I don't think this is the right approach, ep_real_time could go backwards

So the ExpiryPager may have chosen to expire something, but when it reaches here the clock could of shifted meaning this code now says it was an Explicit delete, which is wrong.

We also have the inverse where an explicit delete occurred of an Item which has not yet expired, but when we get here ep_real_time has ticked forward (into the range which makes the Item expire) and suddenly we generate an expiry, again technically incorrect.

We should be passing the delete source down as a parameter, if we are coming from deleteExpiredItem or processExpiredItem the source should be Expiry, otherwise Explicit

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:218, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> In at least one of these patch sets (see 4 and 6), I did have an expiry parameter passed through but changed to the time approach in response to Dave's comments. Both seem somewhat viable options with various pros and cons, although I agree that this approach here could create some crazy edge cases.
