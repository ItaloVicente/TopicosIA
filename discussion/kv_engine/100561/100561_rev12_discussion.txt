DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Introduce usage of Expiration event for DCP

This commit introduces implementation of Expiration event within
DCP, which in turn triggers the Expiration code path instead of
the deletion path. This is done by passing the DeleteSource to
'toItem' from any code that expires a document.
This also implements the ability to output an expiry opcode from
both memory and backfill, as demonstrated by the tests included
in this patch.

Reverted the time check element of this patch to as it was in patch set 6. As far as I can see, there's no simple way of reducing the amount of functions that DeleteSource needs to be passed into, as queueDirty uses toItem so needs to know the source of the deletion.
