DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Introduce usage of Expiration event for DCP

This commit introduces implementation of Expiration event within
DCP, which in turn triggers the Expiration code path instead of
the deletion path. This is done by passing the DeleteSource to
'toItem' from any code that expires a document.
This also implements the ability to output an expiry opcode from
both memory and backfill, as demonstrated by the tests included
in this patch.

Line:610, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> nit: clang-format broken the line wrap? same issue on line 624

Line:3646, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> you could probably always turn noop on and the test would work fine
