DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Introduce usage of Expiration event for DCP

This commit introduces implementation of Expiration event within
DCP, which in turn triggers the Expiration code path instead of
the deletion path. This also introduces the assumption that if the
expiry path is being used, then deletion_v2 is also enabled.
Furthermore, the enum DeleteSrc has been capitalised and moved (I'll
move this to the appropriate patch rather than having it's refactor
in another commit)
