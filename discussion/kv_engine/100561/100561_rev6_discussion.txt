DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Introduce usage of Expiration event for DCP

This commit introduces implementation of Expiration event within
DCP, which in turn triggers the Expiration code path instead of
the deletion path.
This also implements the ability to output an expiry opcode, as
demonstrated by the test included in this patch.

Line:1037, daemon/connection.h -> Might as well use the stronger-typed DeleteSource - easier to read from call-sites (does 'true' mean Deletion or Expiration?)

Line:253, daemon/protocol/mcbp/engine_wrapper.h -> Looks like you've removed the `meta` argument - so the docstring also should be deleted.

Line:573, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Suggest making this part of the constructor; that way we ensure an Item object is always consistent.

Perhaps consider a helper (static) method - makeDeletedItem() which ensures the various fields are set correctly.

Line:615, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> This feels wrong - StoredValue itself should /know/ how it was deleted (assuming it has been deleted already) - we shouldn't have to tell it.

If we logically just copying a StoredValue to an Item; /then/ deleting it then I'd suggest coding it in that fashion.

Line:1433, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> As previous comment, we shouldn't need to carry this around; the StoredValue should know itself how it's been deleted.

Line:615, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> I don't think we should increase the size of StoredValue for this.

You're right we need to check isExpired (passing in the current time); but I wouldn't say it's racy given that our internal clock only advances (it's not based on real-time). As such, I don't think it's a problem to have to made additional calls to the current time in ep-engine to check expired or not - given that you're going to have to do something similar whenever you call toItem to figure it out from the caller's pov.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:615, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Does this hold enough justification to increase the size of StoredValue to store the deletion source then? Even though delete time and expiry time are separate in StoredValue, using exptime == 0 to suggest explicit deletion doesn't account for the case that an object with a future expiry time has been deleted explicitly (before it can expire). That also discounts the use of current time as that would incur a possible race condition. Passing this source through initially appears to me to be the simplest option without increasing StoredValue's size, but there may well be another method I'm missing.
