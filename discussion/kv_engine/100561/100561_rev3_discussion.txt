DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Introduce usage of Expiration event for DCP

This commit introduces implementation of Expiration event within
DCP, which in turn triggers the Expiration code path instead of
the deletion path. This also introduces the assumption that if the
expiry path is being used, then deletion_v2 is also enabled.
This also implements the ability to output an expiry opcode, as
demonstrated by the test included in this patch.
