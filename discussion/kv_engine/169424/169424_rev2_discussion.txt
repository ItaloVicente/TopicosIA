DESCRIPTION:

MB-50461: Ensure bgfetcher never changes non-temp item -> temp item

Before the fix for MB-50423, there could be a non-temp, deleted,
non-resident StoredValue in the HashTable, with no matching value on
disk. In this case, if a bgfetch tried to load the deleted value from
disk, it would get status `no_such_key` and would convert the non-temp
item into a temp non-existent item.

This transition would alter values in the HT without updating the
relevant stats - curr_items should have been decremented, and
curr_temp_items should have been incremented.

However, now that MB-50423 has been resolved, there is no (intentional)
route to having a non-resident deleted SV in the HT. Rather than
changing bgfetch code to update stats in a situation which should now
never happen, instead explicitly refuse to change non-temp items to
temp.

This patch is not strictly necessary to resolve MB-50461, but will
ensure no future bugs can lead to the same stats issue.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> What about metaBgFetch?

Line:220, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> suggest also including the vbid, otherwise the seqno by itself is of limited value.

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> leads to a non-resident, temp-deleted SV - expanded the commit message.
So a later bgfetch for the value finding nothing would lead to temp deleted->temp non-existent.

Though, that can still get us to temp-non-existent with other attributes that aren't always expected - like datatype=xattr but also temp non-existent...

Line:220, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Done
