DESCRIPTION:

MB-50461: Ensure bgfetcher never changes non-temp item -> temp item

Before the fix for MB-50423, there could be a non-temp, deleted,
non-resident StoredValue in the HashTable, with no matching value on
disk. In this case, if a bgfetch tried to load the deleted value from
disk, it would get status `no_such_key` and would convert the non-temp
item into a temp non-existent item.

This transition would alter values in the HT without updating the
relevant stats - curr_items should have been decremented, and
curr_temp_items should have been incremented.

However, now that MB-50423 has been resolved, there is no (intentional)
route to having a non-resident non-temp deleted SV in the HT. Rather
than changing bgfetch code to update stats in a situation which should
now never happen, instead explicitly refuse to change non-temp items to
temp.

Note that a meta BGFetch for deleted item _metadata_ leads to a
non-resident, *temp deleted* SV. This is already temp, so a subsequent
bgfetch for the value can transition it to temp non-existent without
breaking stats.

This patch is not strictly necessary to resolve MB-50461, but will
ensure no future bugs can lead to the same stats issue.
