DESCRIPTION:

MB-32734 [SR]: Add SyncDelete support to HashTable

Update HashTable::unlocked_softDelete() to take a SyncDelete argument
which specifies if the delete should be performed durably. Similar to
SyncWrites, this will stage an additional pending Item in the
HashTable with the proposed deleted state. Upon commit() this will
replace the existing item.

Expand HashTablePerspectiveTest to cover the basic use-cases of this.
