Use the xattr::Blob class to safely access the data (as it may
decompress).

Line:223, daemon/protocol/mcbp/remove_context.cc -> Nit: missing trailing )

Line:227, daemon/protocol/mcbp/remove_context.cc -> To check my understanding here:

- in the case the input isn't compressed; `existingData` is just a view on the underlying value (i.e. no copy needed); but `blob` /will/ create a copy.
- in the case the input is compressed; `existingData` will decompress and make a copy of the underlying data, and then `blob` will in turn be a second copy - i.e. we have an extra copy in here?

I think this is ok (certainly for now), but might be worthy of a quick MB improvement to track it so we can refactor in future.

Line:227, daemon/protocol/mcbp/remove_context.cc -> Yes, but i've spotted a bigger issue which i'll work on here, we're going to point xattr at blob, which will go out of scope. I'll see if I can address both points
