DESCRIPTION:

MB-34316 [SR]: Use VBucket::fetchValueForWrite for lock/unlock/GAT

Add a new method to VBucket::fetchValueForWrite() which is a sibling
to the existing fetchValidValue().

fetchValueForWrite() is intended when the caller wants to acquire an
item to perform a modification - with the advent of prepared items for
SyncWrites, the caller needs to speficy their intent to be directed to
the correct StoredValue.

Update existing callers of fetchValidValue() which were incorrect -
they were actually fetching an item with write intent, which is
incorrect to use fetchValidValue for.
