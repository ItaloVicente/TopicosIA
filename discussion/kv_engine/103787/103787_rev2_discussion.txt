DESCRIPTION:

MB-32712: Don't account spdlog message memory to bucket

Whenever a long (>176 characters) log message from ep-engine is
printed to the memcached.log, the size of that message is not
correctly accounted (decremented) against the Bucket's mem_used.

The effect of this is that the amount of available memory for that
bucket is permanently reduced by the log message size.

(Note this isn't an actual memory leak - all temporary memory is freed
correctly, it's just the usage is incorrectly accounted
internally. The process RSS / VSZ does not increase.)

Details
=======

KV-Engine uses the spdlog library for logging, running in asynchronous
mode. In ep-engine this is implemented in the BucketLogger class,
which amongst other things prefixes the log message with the current
bucket's name.

When a log message is to be printed it is formatted by the calling
thread, then the formatted message pushed onto a queue, to be _sunk_
(written to memcached.log / stderr) by a background thread.

Messages which are longer than 176 bytes after formatting must be
allocated on the heap, which is done in the context of the logging
thread. These messages are freed by the asynchronous background
thread, which is shared between all bucket instances (and hence isn't
associated with any particular bucket).

As such there is a mismatch in the memory accounting for these large
log messages - when created their memory usage is counted against the
given bucket (increasing mem_used); but when freed their memory usage
is essentially ignored as _no_ bucket is associated with the
background thread.

As a consequence the mem_used}for the bucket grows each time such a
log message is printed, eating into the available bucket memory.

Solution
========

Change how memory is tracked in BucketLogger - don't account any
temporary memory allocations to the current bucket. This means that
when the memory is subsequently by the background thread (also not
associated with a bucket), then the alloc / free matches up.

Add new test suite 'ObjectRegistrySpdlogTest' which creates an
enviroment with an ObjectRegistry alongside an async spdlog instance
(the same as used in production). This is then used to verify that
memory is correctly tracked for different log message variants.
