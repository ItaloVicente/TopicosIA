DESCRIPTION:

Add experimental support for gRPC

Very WIP experimental support for gRPC

  * No Auth, but running "privilege" checks for a user provided
    as an extra x-couchbase-user header field (not good)
  * _BLOCKING_ the gRPC call for the duration of an operation
    (intentionally as we've not even tried to plug it into
    our async mode (thread is just waiting for the notification)
  * Only partly implementing the protocol spec'd from
    stellar-nebula (that protocol should probably get some
    love as it duplicates a lot of structs; have some "weird"
    parts etc)
  * Does not deal with all datatypes in all cases, copying over
    xattrs etc

  I've created a bucket named bucket; with the scope foo and
  collection bar. Then created a user named trond which I
  gave access and:

    $ ./grpc_test --user trond Insert '{"key":"User", "content":"blah blah", "scope_name":"foo", "collection_name":"bar", "bucket_name":"bucket"}'
    {
      "cas": 1674136582885998592
    }

    $ ./grpc_test --user trond Remove '{"key":"User", "cas":1674136582885998592, "scope_name":"foo", "collection_name":"bar", "bucket_name":"bucket"}'
    {
      "cas": 1674136637161078784,
      "mutation_token": {
        "bucket_name": "bucket",
        "seq_no": 7,
        "vbucket_id": 417,
        "vbucket_uuid": 214189525548037
      }
    }
