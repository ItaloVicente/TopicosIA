DESCRIPTION:

Add experimental support for gRPC

Very WIP experimental support for gRPC

  * No Auth, No privilege checks :O
  * _BLOCKING_ the gRPC call for the duration of an operation
  * Only partly implementing the protocol spec'd from
    stellar-nebula (that protocol should probably get some
    love as it duplicates a lot of structs; have some "weird"
    parts etc)
  * Some of the call paths may cause the server to crash
    as the "server api" expects a Cookie in production
    and now we're supplying an RpcCookie...
