DESCRIPTION:

Add experimental support for gRPC

Very WIP experimental support for gRPC

  * No Auth, but running "privilege" checks for a user provided
    as an extra x-couchbase-user header field (not good)
  * _BLOCKING_ the gRPC call for the duration of an operation
    (intentionally as we've not even tried to plug it into
    our async mode (thread is just waiting for the notification)
  * Only partly implementing the protocol spec'd from
    stellar-nebula (that protocol should probably get some
    love as it duplicates a lot of structs; have some "weird"
    parts etc)
