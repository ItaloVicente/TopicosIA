@Ceej / build team: What's the "correct" method to deal with the fact that the Well-Formed check is upset here?

These are essentially all forward merges of bugs previously approved for 5.5.3 into 6.0.1 - I don't want to perform 6 separate merges (with 6 new MBs for each forward-merge) just to keep "Well-Formed" happy. 

What do you propose?

Note - I've split the merge into two chunks - the first (this one) is just a no-op as it's a merge of patches which already exist in alice. The second (http://review.couchbase.org/101742) does contain "real" new patches; but again these are things which have previously been approved for 5.5.3 and hence should automatically go into 6.0.1.
