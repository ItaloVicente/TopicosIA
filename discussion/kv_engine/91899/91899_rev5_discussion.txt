DESCRIPTION:

Log transition from one compression mode to another

The KV-engine compression mode has a bearing on the nature of data
that gets stored and it would be useful to log the transition
from one mode to the other

Line:101, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h -> This still has the same problem that the function isn't a member of any class and so is likely to conflict (as it already has previously) with other objects trying to use a similar named method. As suggested, I would move this to be within the BucketCompressionMode class as a static method so that access is something more like BucketCompressionMode::to_string(someVal) which aids readability and also keeps code properly compartmentalised.

Line:101, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h -> BucketCompressionMode is an enum class though. Don't think I can add a method to it unless it is converted to a separate class.

The effort involved in trying to convert BucketCompressionMode to a regular class to have a log message doesn't seem worth it. People who care would probably find it from the ns_server logs.
