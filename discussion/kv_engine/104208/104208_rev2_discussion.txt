DESCRIPTION:

MB-32431: Remove costly checks from TaskQueue::_moveReadyTasks()

As part of the fixes for MB-32181, extra sanity checks were added to
TaskQueue::_moveReadyTasks() to check the futureQueue's
invariants. These were guarded under CB_DEVELOPMENT_ASSERTS so will be
disabled when we branch for release; however they are unfortunately
very costly - a 10% regresssion in replicateTo=1 throughput was
observed when this change was made.

As such, remove the call to futureQueue.assertInvariants - we haven't
actually seen it fire since was added ~2 months ago, so it's probalby
not worth the cost of the check anyway.
