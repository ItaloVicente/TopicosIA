DESCRIPTION:

MB-37944: Prefer cb::const_char_buffer::data() / size()

In preparation for replacing cb::const_char_buffer with C++17's
std::string_view, use the acceessor functions data() and size()
instead of direct access to .buf and .len.

Not _every_ instance has been changed, for example some modified .buf
/ .len directly - those will be cleaned up in a subsequent patch. This
patch however covers the simpl usages, clearing the decks for the more
complex ones for their own patch.
