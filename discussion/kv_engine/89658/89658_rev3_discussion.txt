DESCRIPTION:

MB-25822: Shorten the scope of the lock when releasing a dead connection

The ConnManager is the task responsible for notifying paused connections
to send a NOOP message. Also, the ConnManager releases dead connections.
Both the operations happens in DcpConnMap::manageConnections().
Currently we lock on the 'releaseMutex' before notifying paused
connections, which is not necessary. So, with this change we lock on the
'releaseMutex' just to guard the release of dead connections.
