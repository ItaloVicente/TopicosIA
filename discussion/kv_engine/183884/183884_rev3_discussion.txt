DESCRIPTION:

MB-53053: Add EPEngineGroup type and group quota sharing engines

Add a type which represents a set of ep-engine instances and provides
safe access to them via the tryAssociateBucket API.

Use this type to group together quota sharing engines, such that we can
access them when paging.

Line:7016, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Suggest explicitly removing it in the pause() method (and handling cancellation which should re-add it to the sharing manager group).

I would also suggest expanding the pause/resume cancellation tests (PauseResumeEPTest) to check that the bucket is correctly in the group in the various cancellation cases.

Line:99, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h -> Please document this method.

Line:21, engines/ep/src/ep_engine_group.h -> Might be helpful to the reader to give some example(s) of the common characteristics engines currently share?

Line:39, engines/ep/src/ep_engine_group.h -> Suggest documenting that the returned Handles retain a reference count on the Bucket and hence they should not be stored anywhere long-term as that would inhibit deleting those buckets.

Line:48, engines/ep/src/ep_engine_group.h -> Why? I believe we should be able to update this container when an instance of EventuallyPersistentEngine is deleted?

Line:63, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/ep_engine_group_test.cc -> Can you also test what happens if a deleteBucket occurs when the result of getAll() is still in scope (i.e. the associate correctly updates client count), and then what happens when we delete the getAll() result?

Line:7016, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> I think that should be fine - although we should have a test which checks Paused buckets are not visited by the shared pager.

Line:7016, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> This code was racy. To address this, I've changed the contract of the EPEngineGroup a bit: Inactive engines no longer get dropped from the group. Instead, they must be removed explicitly (and are, as you suggested, removed when the engine is destroyed). So there is no need to add/remove *this from pause/resume. 

Given that's the case now, I believe such a test becomes unnecessary? (Paused engines remain in the EPEngineGroup, but will not be associated with, until the engine is resumed and the bucket state changes to Ready).

Line:63, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/ep_engine_group_test.cc -> I believe this is covered by BucketManagerTest::AssociateBucket? I check whether a bucket handle prevents the bucket (and thereby engine) from being destroyed there. The Handle type returned by getAll() is what is returned by tryAssociateBucket, with the element type rebound to EventuallyPersistentEngine (from EngineIface).
