DESCRIPTION:

MB-37144: Don't set AuxIO & NonIO thread pri to lowest

When setting the priority of Writer threads to lowest,
ExecutorThread::start() was incorrectly setting the priority of the
_current_ thread, not the thread just created. As a result this:

- Didn't lower the priority of the first writer thread

- Also lowered the priority of all threads created afterwards
  (i.e. the AuxIO and NonIO threads).

Fix by moving the setpriority() call to after the thread has been
created, to ExecutorThread::run().
