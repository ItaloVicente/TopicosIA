DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Track disk-seqno in DurabilityMonitor

This patch adds support for disk-seqno tracking, which enables
Level::PersistToMajority in the DurabilityMonitor.

Note that at this stage the test coverage is poor. Here I add just a
basic test for checking the new logic, but the new feature introduces
a much wider set of test case scenarios that require some refactor in
the DurabilityMonitor test classes. I defer this refactor to a dedicated
patch. I will improve the test coverage on top of that.
