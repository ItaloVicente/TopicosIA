DESCRIPTION:

MB-51681: ChkptManager::getMemUsage should include sizeof(Checkpoint)

Checkpoint::getMemUsage includes the size of the Checkpoint structure,
but CheckpointManager::getMemUsage (and subsequently
checkpointManagerEstimatedMemUsage) does not. Update this and any
tests to account for this.
