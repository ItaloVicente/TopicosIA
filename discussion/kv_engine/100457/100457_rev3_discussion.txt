DESCRIPTION:

MB-30854: Add support for Required IPv4/IPv6 listeners

+Problem+

Currently memcached attempts to bind IPv4 and IPv6 listening ports
based on the "ipv4" & "ipv6" parameters for each interface listed in
the config file, with the following values:

    true  - Attempt to listen on the given port/protocol.
    false - Don't attempt to listen on the given port/protocol.

If we fail to bind on a given protocol, it is only considered a fatal
error if _no_ protocol could be bound. For example; if IPv4 fails but
IPv6 succeeds then that's treated as a warning and memcached will
continue to startup.

This can be problematic in some deployments - consider an environment
using IPv4, but which has IPv6 present on the system. If memcached
fails to listen on IPv4 then memcached will still start, even though
this node is not accessible.

This is particulary troublesome if the management port (11209) *is*
successful in listening, as ns_server will consider the memcached
process healthy (and potentially distribute vBuckets to it) - even
through clients (using port 11210) cannot connect.

+Solution+

This patch changes the ipv4 & ipv6 interface parameters, adding a new
"required" value which allows ns_server to specify that this
port/protocol *must* bind. There are now three possible values:

* required - The specified protocol must be enabled on this
             interface. If it cannot be enabled, then memcached will
             fail to start.

* optional - The specified protocol should be enabled on this
             interface. If it cannot be enabled, then permit memcached
             to still start.

* off      - Do not attempt to enable the specified protocol on this
             interface.

(The previous boolean values of true and false are still supported for
backwards compatibility; mapping to "optional" and "off"
respectively).

This patch also adds additional logging around the creation of the
listening sockets; to make it more explicit when a listening socket
fails.

Note: the default value for both ipv4 & ipv6 is "optional" - this is
      /close/ to the previous behaviour - a failure to bind is not
      considered fatal - however it *does* mean that failing to bind
      any protocols on a given interface is no longer fatal. The
      expectation is that ns_server should be specifying at least one
      protocol as "required" going forward.

Dave - I wanted to check the behavior of this and Abhi's patch (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/100485/) prior to merging. I think I found one problem - can I ask you to look at it and if you believe I'm mistaken then fine to merge the patches on my behalf.

The memcached.json file looks fine. Memcached restarts constantly if it's in IPv4 required and the IPv4 port is not available. However, if I start a separate process (nc) listening on the same port but an IPv6 socket, memcached still restarts constantly.

Can you try this and see if you see the same behavior. If indeed this is a problem, better to address now rather than let this get to QE.

Hi Dave,

So I restested - TL;DR: the code is ok, but out-of-the-box netcat doesn't actually do what we want (bind to only IPv6); we need to use another method (I chose "netcat6"

---

Attempting to block IPv6 using netcat with the arguments:

    $ nc -6 -l 12000

This indeed does result in memcached failing to start - as it reports it cannot bind IPv6 (expected), but *also* cannot bind IPv4 (not expected!):

    2018-10-11T10:05:37.110110Z INFO Enable user port(s)
    2018-10-11T10:05:37.111212Z WARNING Failed to bind to [::]:12000 - Address already in use
    2018-10-11T10:05:37.111304Z WARNING Failed to bind to 0.0.0.0:12000 - Address already in use
    2018-10-11T10:05:37.111326Z CRITICAL Failed to create required IPv4 socket for "*:12000"
    2018-10-11T10:05:37.111328Z WARNING Failed to create optional IPv6 socket for "*:12000"

Why can memcached not bind IPv4 here? Examining the state of listening sockets, we see something curious - netcat is listening on "tcp46" protocol socket:

    $ netstat -lna|grep "Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local\|12000"
    Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
    tcp46      0      0  *.12000                *.*                    LISTEN

Some Googling suggests this is because of IPv6 dual-stack - unless the socket is bound with the IPV6_V6ONLY socket option, an AF_INET6 socket will also bind the IPv4 variant. From http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/ipv6.7.html :

       IPV6_V6ONLY (since Linux 2.4.21 and 2.6)
              If this flag is set to true (nonzero), then the socket is re‐
              stricted to sending and receiving IPv6 packets only.  In this
              case, an IPv4 and an IPv6 application can bind to a single
              port at the same time.

              If this flag is set to false (zero), then the socket can be
              used to send and receive packets to and from an IPv6 address
              or an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address.

              The argument is a pointer to a boolean value in an integer.

              The default value for this flag is defined by the contents of
              the file /proc/sys/net/ipv6/bindv6only.  The default value for
              that file is 0 (false).

Indeed, in memcached we do set IPV6_V6ONLY when binding our IPv6 listening socket.

Instead of "nc", I tested using nc6 ("brew install netcat6" on macOS), which does set IPV6_V6ONLY:

    $ nc6 -6 -l -p 12000

Checking via netstat, note proto is now "tcp6" (not dual-stack):

    $ netstat -lna|grep "Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local\|12000"
    Proto Recv-Q Send-Q  Local Address          Foreign Address        (state)
    tcp6       0      0  *.12000                                       *.*                                           LISTEN

Now if we re-test memcached we see the expected result: IPv4 (required) succeeds, IPv6 (optional) fails and memcached successfully starts:
