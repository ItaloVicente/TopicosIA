DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Remove verified SyncWrites at commit

With this patch we remove a SyncWrite from the tracked container as soon
as it is committed.

Note that in general a SyncWrite could be referenced by some (only 1 for
now) replica iterator. That is why some enhancement to our tracking
model is necessary, so that it is resilient to the remival of referenced
SyncWrites.
