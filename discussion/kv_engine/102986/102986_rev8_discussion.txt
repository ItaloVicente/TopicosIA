DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Remove verified SyncWrites at commit

With this patch we remove a SyncWrite from the tracked container as soon
as it is committed.

Note that in general a SyncWrite could be referenced by some (only 1 for
now) replica iterator. That is why some enhancement to our tracking
model is necessary, so that it is resilient to the removal of referenced
SyncWrites.

Note that with the new tracking we always keep for a replica:
- the seqno of the last SyncWrite ack'ed
- the last ack'ed seqno
Those are useful for both validating the internal DurabilityMonitor
state and exposing for stats. I will add the latter in a follow-up
patch.

Line:47, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Maybe rename to lastSyncWriteSeqno or similar - something to make the difference more explicit between the two variables.

Line:282, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> What if pos_.it is begin()? Won't `prev` be invalid?

Line:286, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Nit: Should use Ensures() for post-conditions (Expects is for preconditions).

Line:124, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Returning references to internal state can get a little tricky once we have multiple threads working - we cannot drop the lock before we finish with Position as the reference could be invalidated. Given the size of Position is small, I think the cost of copying it isn't a problem so you could just return by copy.

Line:139, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> What's the next position - just the next element, or something related to seqnos.

Line:179, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> This and `getReplicaMemorySeqno` have similar names, but subtly-different purposes. Could you see if you can rename one / both so their names are more different / obvious?

Line:47, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Done

Line:282, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> std::prev returns Container::end() if pos is at Container::begin. 
Setting Position::it = Container::end() is fine

Line:286, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Done

Line:124, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> I agree.
If you look at the implementation you'll see that the purpose of this function is only validation:

const Position& getReplicaMemoryPosition(replica) {
    if (replica-not-valid) { throw; }
    return replica-pos;
}

Also, returning a reference is strictly necessary only from the callers that want to modify the DurabilityMonitor internal state.

So my plan is:
- move the validation in a dedicated helper-function and call it whenever the validation is useful
- return a copy here, so this function will be used only by callers that don't modify the internal DM state
- do all the internal state modification where needed by accessing directly chain->memoryPosition.at(replica), so there's no need to return any reference

I planned to resolved that in a follow-up patch to avoid too much noise here, are you happy with that?
But we can do the change here if you prefer

Line:282, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> I didn't think that was true in the general case for STL containers - is std::list a special case?

Might be cleaner if you explicitly check for already being at begin().

Line:124, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Thanks for the explanation. A follow-up patch is fine.

Line:282, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> I assumed that and it is for what I see on local env, but (strangely enough) I couldn't find any exact info on std::prev docs.
That doesn't even ensure that this is not portable, so I'll check if pos is at begin().
