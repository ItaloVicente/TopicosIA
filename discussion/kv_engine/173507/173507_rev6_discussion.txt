DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Add SnapshotRequirements and checks

RangeScans can be created with optional parameters that state a
vbucket uuid and sequence number.

This commit adds:

* in-memory uuid check on the frontend worker, failing the create
  with "not_my_vbucket"
* snapshot "must-contain" seqno check in the I/O task (optional at
  the request of the caller).

A future commit will add checks that the seqno was at least persisted
with a wait+timeout if not.
