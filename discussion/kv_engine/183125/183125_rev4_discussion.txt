DESCRIPTION:

kv_slow_ops_2_gtrace: Prefer opaque from packet field

clientID /should/ be a tuple of "connectionID/opaque", but not all
clients obey this convention. As such, if the trace has the
packet.opaque field (newer server versions added it), use that
instead.

(Also include worker_tid in the output as I spotted that was missed
out when added to the server output).
