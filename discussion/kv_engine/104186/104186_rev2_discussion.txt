DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Use a single packet validator

The packet validator consists of an array of 256 function pointers,
where each entry provides the validator for the opcode with the
value of the index into the array. This results in a memory
footprint of 2k. Given that the validator doesn't keep any
internal state there is no point of adding a 2k payload
to the bucket metadata (The pre-allocated bucket array is
set to 100 entries).

Gah, mobile Gerrit seemed to have dropped my comment :(. I’d asked why you were using a heap-allocated object owned via unique_ptr and not just a statically allocated object.

clang-tidy normally prints out a warning from those (that if it throws an exception it won't be caught etc). We don't catch those exceptions here either (and there isn't much to do else than crash if we fail to create it), but it does remove the clang-tidy warning..

Hmm, what exception does it say would be thrown?
