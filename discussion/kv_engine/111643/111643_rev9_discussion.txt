DESCRIPTION:

MB-34873: Ack prepares from disk snapshots after persisting snapEnd

Any prepare received by a replica from a disk snapshot may have deduped
an earlier prepare of a higher level.

For example, the following ops (for the same key)

PRE(l=PersistToMajority) CMT PRE(l=Majority) CMT

May be deduped to

PRE(l=Majority) CMT

If we acked this prepare immediately, were we to (say) be promoted to
active and immediately crash, we may be left with no value on disk for
the key BUT the PersistToMajority op may have returned SUCCESS to the
client (it was committed) - we have broken the durability agreement for
that op.

Solution: we cannot ack any prepare until the full snapshot is
persisted *just in case* a PersistToMajority prepare was deduped.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might also be worth mentioning the degenerate case:

 PRE(l=PersistToMajority) CMT PRE(l=Majority) SET

is de-duped to:

 SET

And as such, even if there's not any prepares explicitly listed we must defer updating HPS until complete disk snapshot is persisted.

Line:394, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> I think this is unnecessary here - we shouldn't have ever added any SyncWrites to trackedWrites with an invalid (None) level. 

If there isn't already a precondition along these lines in addSyncWrite, that would be the place to check this.

Line:1957, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Prefer non-wildcard captures (esp for such a simple function) - just capture the variables you need.

Line:1959, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Can you add similar calls to this at the various stages below to ensure we advance HPS / HCS correctly.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Definitely - will catch up with you and ben re: if *every* dur op in a disk snapshot is reduced to a set tomorrow
Will keep as a TODO

Line:394, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Done

Line:1957, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Done

Line:1959, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> HPS/HCS are checked in addSyncWrite, notify{Persistence,snapEnd} too - will add asserts for trackedWrites
