DESCRIPTION:

MB-34873: Ack prepares from disk snapshots after persisting snapEnd

Any prepare received by a replica from a disk snapshot may have deduped
an earlier prepare of a higher level.

For example, the following ops (for the same key)

PRE(l=PersistToMajority) CMT PRE(l=Majority) CMT

May be deduped to

PRE(l=Majority) CMT

If we acked this prepare immediately, were we to (say) be promoted to
active and immediately crash, we may be left with no value on disk for
the key BUT the PersistToMajority op may have returned SUCCESS to the
client (it was committed) - we have broken the durability agreement for
that op.

Solution: we cannot ack any prepare until the full snapshot is
persisted *just in case* a PersistToMajority prepare was deduped.
