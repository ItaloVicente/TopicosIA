Line:97, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> This is problematic - as you're requiring that the target is installed before you test it - and IIRC this isn't what `make test` currently does.

Line:97, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> At a high level I think adding couchbase-cli to PYTHONPATH is the correct approach.

Note that there's a CMake variable (something like CouchbaseClient_SOURCE_DIR) which points to where the couchbase-cli project is checked-out so you don't have to hard-code it.

BTW currently one can run cbstats directly from the source directory (handy during development as you don't have to invoke make at-all) - it would be highly desirable if this could be maintained - or at least provide a convenience CMake target or similar which adds the appropriate paths before running.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:97, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> True, but it seems to be difficult to get natsort in scope otherwise. 

The alternatives would be to use code within cbstats to force it to expand its PYTHONPATH (which I have tried and it both did not work and essentially hardwires an assumption that couchbase-cli is in the same directory as kv-engine, which really doesn't seem like a good approach). 

The other alternative would be to use the Cmakelist to somehow copy over the natsort library into KV directly, which to me seems unnecessary when install can reference it properly without having to duplicate it. 

Is there another alternative I'm missing cause I know by having this it potentially breaks the straight out usage of cbstats without installing first (unless the user already has the natsort package installed)
