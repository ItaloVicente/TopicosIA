DESCRIPTION:

RocksDB: Prevent delVBucket racing with the flusher

Accessing the WriteBatch from both the flusher and delVBucket can lead
to corruption, but writing two batches to the DB concurrently is safe.

*However*, delVBucket needs synchronisation to prevent the flusher
committing its batch while delVBucket is in progress, to prevent writes
which occur during a vBucket being recreated being lost.
