DESCRIPTION:

MB-29377: Add logger benchmark to CBNT testing

Refactor the benchmark code to have a base class, this is so
that the results are easily identifiable as to what they belong
to. Add the benchmark to the CBNT suite definition.

File Comment: logger/benchmark_fixture.h -> Style this filename is ambiguous outside the context of the directory - i.e. if I was searching for this in an IDE I'd have to remember that the _logger_ fixture was just called `benchmark_fixture.h`. I'd suggest renaming it - something like `logger_bench_fixture`.

*Edit:* looking at the rest of the change; it seems a bit overkill to even put this in it's own header given it's only ever used by logger_benchmark.cc - suggest you just declare the class there.
Line:30, logger/logger_benchmark.cc -> Technically this message isn't correct - it didn't fail to shutdown; it actually was never initialised in the first place. Can you re-word?
