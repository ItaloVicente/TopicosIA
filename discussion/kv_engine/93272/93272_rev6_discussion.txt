DESCRIPTION:

MB-29377: Add logger benchmark to CBNT testing

Refactor the benchmark code to have a base class, this is so
that the results are easily identifiable as to what they belong
to.

Add two further benchmark tests which log a message for a set
number of times on each thread.

Add the benchmark to the CBNT suite definition.
