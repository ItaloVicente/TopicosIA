DESCRIPTION:

MB-30137: Decrement total on-disk items for deletes for full eviction

In in the case of full eviction, the total number of on-disk items
is the source of truth about the total number of items in the
database. Consider the following scenario for a key K:

(i)  store(K, V1): onDiskItems - 1 after persistence
(ii) delete(K): onDiskItems - 1 (before persistence)
(iii) Before persistence of (ii) store(K, V2): onDiskItems - 2

Persistence Callback of (ii) will notice that the rev seqno has
changed because of (iii) and hence will not decrement the
on-disk items. Solution is to decrement the on-disk items on
persistence of a deleted item even if the rev seqno has been
updated

(3 comments)
Line:701, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_test.cc -> Nit: make_pair() should deduce types for you, shouldn't need the explicit <X, Y>

Line:718, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_test.cc -> worth expanding this to also invoke the callback for the second store, checking numItems is back up to 1 ?

Line:746, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_test.cc -> "only Full eviction" ?
