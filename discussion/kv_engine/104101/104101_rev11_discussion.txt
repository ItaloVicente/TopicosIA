DESCRIPTION:

MB-32807 [SR]: Enable Multiple-Replicas

With this patch we switch on Multiple-Replicas for Durability.
Two main changes here:

1) We remove the hard-coded node names in ReplicationChain and we set
the chain dynamically with what is passed by ns_server through
set-vbucket-state.

2) Given that ns_server doesn't pass the topology information yet, we
temporarily update the Replication Chain at master when the Producer
receives the 'cunsumer_name' via DcpControl.
Note that this is just a workaround, we'll remove it as soon as
ns_server provides the topology via set-vbucket-state.
