DESCRIPTION:

MB-51877: Add a command to set the throttle limits

Allow for an external component to set the limits used for
throttling for a given bucket:

    // Configure the bucket "default" to throttle when
    // we exceed 5k RCU/s or 1k WCU/s
    adminConnection->execute(
        SetBucketComputeUnitThrottleLimitsCommand{"default",
                                                  5 * 1024,
                                                  1024});
