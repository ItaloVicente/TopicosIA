DESCRIPTION:

MB-33549: Ensure reset() resets all of EPStats' stats

Previously, not all stats were reset by calls to
EPStats::reset. Add the missing stats to the
call.

Also add these stats to the initialization/reset
tests.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:284, engines/ep/src/stats.cc -> +1 to Ben's comments. To phrase a different way; we broadly have three classes of fields in EPStats:

1) Derived configuration settings (watermarks in bytes, etc). These should not be reset (by users or anyone else) as that would break various things. Arguably these should not be in EPStats but in a different `EPConfig` or similar class.

2) Counter statistics - i.e. things which are only ever incremented (ops performed, items evicted, etc). Other things downstream (prometheus) may sample them and derive rates from them, but at the kv-engine these are just increasing values. These can be reset back to an initial value.

3) Guage statistics - i.e. things which increase _and_ decrease - outstanding bg fetch items, flusher queue sizes. These should _not_ be reset to zero, as they would likely then show invalid values in future (e.g. go negative).

The types of (1,2,3) are not entirely explicit in EPStats, so they do currently need handling on a per-instance basis.

To the point about the original MB - I would interpret it more as we had some Counter-type stats (e.g. ep_item_commit_failed ) which were not reset originally (for valid reasons), so it's functionally correct to reset them here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:284, engines/ep/src/stats.cc -> It's probably a good idea to initialize them somewhere, be it in the constructor or on the declaration. I think everything in Stats is initialized in the constructor so that's probably better for consistency.

---

I'm not sure if we'd need a new privilege level, but I think that it should at least be done via some other mechanism. You can always refer back to the original MB and discussion here for whoever looks at it in the future.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:284, engines/ep/src/stats.cc -> Good catch, I'd assumed all Counters would be safe but checked through any operator-- uses and found a few more:

- stats.numRemainingBgJobs
- stats.pendingCompactions (times two)

fetch_sub uses:
- stats.numRemainingBgItems
- stats.pendingOps

These are all currently not reset, and maybe should be.

There was also uses of -=:
- stats.replicaCheckpointOverhead
- stats.replicaHTMemory

Both of which are not currently explicitly initialized in the EPStats ctor.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:284, engines/ep/src/stats.cc -> Sorry, I wrote the wrong thing and meant the opposite 😄 - those stats are all currently reset, and *shouldn't* be, because of the same reasons as you pointed out with diskQueueSize.

The non-initialized ones, they definitely shouldn't be reset, but would we prefer they were initialized in the constructor for completeness?

---

Good idea on the extra privilege side, will create another MB to track I think.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:284, engines/ep/src/stats.cc -> Those stats should all quiesce to 0 under normal operation, and a reset of them could cause "negative" values (Counter is actually unsigned so we'd underflow to a huge value). I think a normal reset should not reset these values.

replicaCheckpointOverhead and replicaHTMemory are both used by the ItemPager for ephemeral buckets to work out how much memory we can page out. If we were to reset those and they go negative then we'd potentially screw up the ItemPager and I suspect run too much/evict too much (but I didn't look that deeply at the code). Given we use those to make actual operational decisions I don't think they should ever be reset.

All of that being said, looking at the motivation for this MB, it looks to me as though support wanted the ability to reset bugged stats back to 0 to avoid alarms going off. If one of these stats were to bug out then we'd be in the same place as we currently are. I think without these few stats that we decrement this change is in a good place, but we might want to reconsider one of the other proposed solutions as a followup change:

> Add an extra privilege - ResetAllStats or similar which is required to reset the "special" stats.

Whilst a normal user can't reset stats anyway, it's still not desirable for support to risk "breaking" other stats by hitting reset, so I think by default we don't want to reset these counters that quiesce to 0, but having some other "I really do know what I'm doing and I've really made sure the system is quiesced already" reset method might still be useful for these extra stats such as pendingCompactions and diskQueueSize. Perhaps that would be a good followup change or spin-off MB for the future.
