DESCRIPTION:

MB-33549: Ensure reset() resets all of EPStats' stats

Previously, not all stats were reset by calls to
EPStats::reset. Add the missing stats to the
call.

Additionally, enable initialization and reset tests
for the missing stats.

ep_testsuite's test_value_eviction will cause
diskQueueSize, a non-negative integer, to
underflow through the now removed call to
reset_stats. The AggregatedFlushStats' line
  `stats.diskQueueSize -= numItems;`
causes the underflow, likely because reset_stats
was called just before, resetting diskQueueSize
to zero.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why lines aren't taking advantage of the full allowed size?

Line:4086, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I think that removing this call might "fix" indeed the diskQueueSize underflow test failure that you see with this patch, but the real issue is still there.

The problem with underflows is that we spot them only when things like NonNegativeCounter goes negative (which is what I think is happening before you remove this call).
But, some stats might be underflowing silently without going negative, which is what it might still be happening on diskQueueSize after removing this call.

I think that first we should fully understand what's the problem on diskQueueSize in this patch. Then we'll be able to fix without removing the reset_stats() call here.

Line:4086, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> There's a similar issue with totalPersistVBState, and wait_for_stat_to_be_gte(1, ep_persist_vbstate_total) timing out because it's been reset to zero after being incremented, and before the waiting function has woken up and checked the value.

In this case it's not so clear that it shouldn't be reset - it does seem more like a stat that is expected to always increase - but it is used in one of the tests, and causes timeouts currently (without a wait_for_flusher or other change).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:4086, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I think that you're going to hit the same issue on other quantities too, eg things like flusher_todo etc.., all quantities that fall in category (2) as per Ben's comment.

Let's step back 1 second. The scope of the related MB is well defined:

 > cbstats reset does not reset stats for "ep_item_commit_failed" and "ep_item_flush_failed" and currently, the only way to reset these stats is to restart couchbase-server. Restarting nodes is too heavy-handed for the sole purpose of clearing stats.
As some monitoring systems may report false alarms due to these values staying non-zero after resolving the underlying issue, it would be useful to be able to clear these stats with cbstats reset.

Is all this refactor necessary?
It feels a bit out-of-scope to me.. ep_item_commit_failed / ep_item_flush_failed are special quantities that I think some compenent (eg ns_server) uses for detecting unhealthy nodes, so I see the reason behaind the MB.
So we could just touch those for now rather then moving a bunch of stuff around

Line:4086, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Resetting that stat seems fine to me, we can probably just fix the issue with the tests. How exactly did that manifest? I can see the wait on the stat to be 1 in the test_setup function, but where are the stats being reset?

Line:4086, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> That's a really good point. Now you've pointed it out it seems obvious that it shouldn't be reset. Will revert the test and reset changes, and check if any of the other stats fall into the same category.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:4086, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Good point. I checked it out further, and as you suggested it seems to be a (logical) race between EPStats::reset() and VBucket::doAggregatedFlushStats.

Since the flusher is executing in a background thread, and some tests follow this with a call to reset the stats, the variable diskQueueSize may be reset to zero and *then* have the numItems subtracted from it - leading to an underflow error.

This is only an issue in the tests, since production builds have the underflow policy for non-negative counters set to "clamp".

These errors have been resolved by adding `wait_for_flusher_to_settle` inside reset's test fixture, reset_stats, which should address all usages in the tests.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:4086, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> I think that this raises an interesting point, and that working around the issue here might be the wrong thing to do.

Whilst you're right that production (e.g. 7.1.0) builds do have the underflow policy set to clamp, development builds, the ones that QE use to test all but the final release candidates, do not. They use the throwing policy, with the intent that we find bugs in the stat implementations early on.

Personally I think that there are two categories of stat here:

1) Counters that we expect to always increase (e.g. warmedUpKeys)
2) Stats that quiesce to 0 (e.g. diskQueueSize)

I think that resetting stats in the first category is fine, but resetting stats in the second category is not. The stats in the first category typically reflect something that happened in the past, and the stats in the second category typically reflect the current state of the system. I'd argue that we shouldn't be resetting stats in the second category because:

a) They'll eventually become 0
b) We may not be able to rely on these stats for debug information (especially if we aren't logging when stats are reset)
c) If QE reset stats under normal operation and we throw due to underflow then we'll waste time debugging the stat and find it harder to reason about whether or not the stat is correct
