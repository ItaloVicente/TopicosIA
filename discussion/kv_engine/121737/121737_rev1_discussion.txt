DESCRIPTION:

Build nobucket as a static library

We don't need nobucket to be a shared library. In theory all of our
engines could be linked statically as we no longer load them
dynamically at link time. By keeping some of them as shared objects
we get better integration with perf (as it can split the CPU time
into shared objects), but perf analysis have a limited value
for nobucket ;-)

Is it really worth doing this? This means that some engines are built differently to others, which I suspect could potentially cause confusion. I think we should keep them all the same type (which as you highlight is probably best as shared for things like perf integration etc).

We've already got a huge mix of shared libraries vs archives so I really don't see why this would cause more confusion than other places? Moving forward we'll get rid of the memcached buckets and the only bucket we've got left would be couchbase bucket...

Well, we'll still have ewouldblock_engine, and being able to split ep.so, ewouldblock_engine.so from memcached.exe in perf is useful. 

What's the actual benefit of this change?

Simplicity and cleanup (just like when we stopped building the other shared objects).

Note I don't know qualitatively how large ep.so is (esp in debug builds etc), but if we (statically) link it into every exe which needs it (memcached.exe, engine_testapp, ...?) then we might end up bloating the build directory a bit (IIRC this was why we merged the various memcached_testapp binaries into one). Do you know how many programs link ep.so?

Additionally, this will increase the (compile-time) linking duration, again that will depend on how many things link ep.so.

I guess I'd rather have all the engines as shared (or none of them) - I think that consistency will be clearer. Assuming symbols are sensibly prefixed I _guess_ the `linux perf` argument isn't that strong compared to the simplification in linking etc.

I have no plans of changing ep.so. nobucket was created to that I didn't have to add "if engine == null return ENGINE_NOBUCKET" every time we touched an engine in some context so to me it is an internal piece of memcached core just like "enginemap"
