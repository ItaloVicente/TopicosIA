DESCRIPTION:

Build nobucket as a static library

We don't need nobucket to be a shared library. In theory all of our
engines could be linked statically as we no longer load them
dynamically at link time. By keeping some of them as shared objects
we get better integration with perf (as it can split the CPU time
into shared objects), but perf analysis have a limited value
for nobucket ;-)
