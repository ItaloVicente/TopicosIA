DESCRIPTION:

Refactor keyIndexAllocatorAccountsForKey

In line with other uses in the tests:
 * Use 'x' as padding character for keys
 * Use star instead of dash for formatting to avoid confusion with
  subtraction when comments include math

Change before/after tests of keyIndexAllocatorBytes to avoid
transitively relying on previous EXPECTs to be true.
