DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor] Use a single nlohmann::json for cookie errors

Use nlohmann::json for the cookie error context instead
of 3 different variables.

Allow the caller to inject more information into the
"error" blob of the returned JSON as long as they
don't try to override "ref" and "context" which is
the two entries that the core inserts.
