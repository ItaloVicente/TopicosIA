DESCRIPTION:

[2/N] Use chrono-based UptimeClock instead of rel_time_t

Update the remaining uses of rel_time_t in ep-engine to use either
time_t or UptimeLock as appropriate. Also update some uses of raw
(untyped) durations not directly associated with a clock to use
std::chrono::{milli,micro,}seconds.
