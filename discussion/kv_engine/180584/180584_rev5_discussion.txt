DESCRIPTION:

MB-46740: CM::getItemsForCursor() allows to specify a byte-limit

The function already accepts 'approxLimit' in input, whose metric is
'num items'.
The new CursorMoveLimitType arg allows the user to specify whether the
approxLimit is expressed in num-items or bytes.

The semantic of approxLimit stays unchanged. Apart from some exception,
in general the function always moves the cursor at checkpoint
boundaries for generating consistent snapshots. So, the function moves
the cursor to a checkpoint boundary that is greater/equal to
approxLimit.

Feature added with full test coverage but not used yet in he prod code.
We'll start using the new API in DCP in follow-up patches.
