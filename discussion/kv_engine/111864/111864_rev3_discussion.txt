DESCRIPTION:

MB-34910: Trigger commit from warmup

A final new piece of warmup functionality is that ep_vb
restoreOutstandingPreparesFromWarmup now gives the ADM a 'poke'
(checkForCommit) as some of the loaded prepares may actually be
candidates for commit, a new test demonstrates this
(DurabilityWarmupTest.WarmupCommit)
