DESCRIPTION:

MB-36890: Make Observe return tmpfail for sync write in progress

To work with durability, Observe must not treat maybe visible prepares
as present. Rather than adding a new per-key status to the observe
multipart response (complicating backwards compatability) simply fail
the entire observe request.
