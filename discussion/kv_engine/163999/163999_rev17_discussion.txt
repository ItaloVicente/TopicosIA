DESCRIPTION:

MB-49071: Use std::any for engine-specific storage [1/2]

std::any allows us to avoid reinterpret_casts from void* and to use
smart pointers for memory management.

This will be a two-part patch. This first part swaps out the underlying
void* storage with std::any and ensures that memory allocations are
correctly accounted for, but it does not change the interface of the
(get|set)EngineStorage methods we use in EventuallyPersistentEngine to
acccess the stored data.

I will refactor those methods and their callers to std::any in a
follow-up patch.
