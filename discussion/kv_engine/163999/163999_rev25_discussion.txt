DESCRIPTION:

MB-49071: Make engine-specific storage type-safe [1/2]

Using an interface type for the engine-specific storage allows us to
avoid reinterpret_casts from void* and to use smart pointers for
automatic memory management of objects with lifetime bound by the
command context.

This will be a two-part patch. This first part swaps out the underlying
void* storage with EngineStorageIface and ensures that memory
allocations are correctly accounted for, but it does not change the
interface of the (get|set)EngineStorage methods we use in
EventuallyPersistentEngine to acccess the stored data.

I will refactor those methods and their callers to EngineStorageIface
in a follow-up patch.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Generally the approach looks good. Few specific comments below. 
Line:14, engines/ep/src/engine_storage.h -> ep_engine.h and object registry.h appear unused here.

Line:817, include/memcached/engine.h -> Why is this necessary? Assuming EngineStorageIface has a virtual dtor (and any subclasses "do the right thing", the caller should just be able to delete an EngineStorageIface object directly.

Line:249, include/memcached/types.h -> This feels overly complex, and likely brittle. If a cookie outlives an engine which has already been destroyed, there's probably all kinds of Bad Things which could happen (any call into the EngineIface could crash), so I believe we'll just end up having the complexity / cost of a weak_ptr being created for every Cookie instance.

I don't believe you're changing the lifetime model here - Cookies _should_ already only assume a valid engine while they are executing (i.e. while a command returns EWOULDBLOCK). Once a command has returned a final status code, we can consider that command completed - and assert that the cookie's engineStorage has already been cleared by the engine.

Line:32, utilities/engine_storage.cc -> We always build with debug information - CMake build type "RelWithDebInfo" with NDEBUG defined: https://github.com/couchbase/tlm/blob/master/cmake/Modules/CouchbaseGccOptions.cmake#L92

Instead guard with CB_DEVELOPMENT_ASSERTS

Line:14, engines/ep/src/engine_storage.h -> Thanks!

Line:817, include/memcached/engine.h -> I've added this method to allow EngineStorageIface-derived classes, which are heap allocated, to be deallocated correctly. EPEngineStorage is allocated under a BucketAllocationGuard, and releaseEngineStorage just frees it under the same. https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/163999/25/engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc#1848

I see a couple of ways of avoiding adding a method in EngineIface, there might be more. We could use a fatter (possibly type-erased) deleter in cb::unique_engine_storage_ptr, which can store a pointer to the engine and do the same `BucketAllocationGuard g(ptr);` without calling into EngineIface. 

Or to avoid increasing the size of the deleter, we could allocate the EPEngineStorage class under a NonBucketAllocationGuard, deallocate it under the same using a function pointer deleter in cb::unique_engine_storage_ptr. Only then we also need to have the ~EPEngineStorage perform some magic to deallocate the EPEngineStorage members under a BucketAllocationGuard (as my assumption is that data stored in the engine specific is allocated under the engine's memory domain).

I'm thinking the current approach is somewhat simpler, but don't have any strong opinions on the matter.

Line:249, include/memcached/types.h -> >  cost of a weak_ptr being created for every Cookie instance.

Actually, it is created for every EngineStorageIface, which I think makes it mildly better/more measurable. We pay the cost only when using the engine specific. 

It is used such that _if_ we end up calling Cookie::reset() or ~Cookie() and there is some engine storage and the engine has been destroyed, we can "catch" it and not crash. This was my interpretation of what Trond said in a comment above (https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/163999/comments/5d44cf6b_987f6c38), but I might have misunderstood.

Line:32, utilities/engine_storage.cc -> Ack

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:817, include/memcached/engine.h -> So part of my concern of adding releaseEngineStorage() method to the public API is the potential for misuse - one shouldn't go around releasing engine storage unless the object has definable finished use. This is a very C-style API (think free()) - ideally the owner of the storage should be the one responsible for releasing it, and ideally this is symmetric with where the storage is allocated - think paired operator new / delete.

The rationale for having EngineStorageIface is that should encapsulate the lifetime and access to objects stored by the engine and given to the cookie. I think that is a better place to put the actual deallocation code.

For example, have you considered something like a deallocate() virtual method on EngineStorageIface which would be responsible for freeing engine storage subclasses? e.g.

    class EngineStorageIface {
        ...
        virtual void deallocate() = 0;
    };

Then EPEngineStorage::deallocate() would look like the current releaseEngineStorage():

    class EPEngineStorage : public EngineStorageIface {
        ...
        EventuallyPersistentEngine& owner;

        void deallocate() override {
            BucketAllocationGuard guard(&owner);
            delete this;
        }
    }

"delete this" is a bit unusual, but it's legal and I believe safe here as long
as we ensure that deallocate() is only called as part of the unique_ptr's Deleter (perhaps a bit of friend / private can be used to make it harder to misuse). EngineStorageDeleter then simply becomes (ignoring checks):

    class EngineStorageDeleter {
        ...
        void operator()(const EngineStorageIface* engine_storage) const {
            engine_storage->deallocate();
        }
    }

That should not be the case, as the IsValidInstanceFlag is default initialised in the EngineStorageDeleter, in the nullptr cb::unique_engine_storage_ptr that all cookies have. The default initialiser of the weak_ptr assigns nullptr and does not allocate a ref-count block.

I'm happy to remove this monstrosity regardless 😊

In terms of catching lifetime ordering issues, we already have tools like Asan / TSan which I cover this (and many other object relations). I think as long as we assert the cookie's engineSpecific is empty after the command has completed we should have sufficient defence.
