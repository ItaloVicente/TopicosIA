DESCRIPTION:

MB-49071: Make engine-specific storage type-safe [1/2]

Using an interface type for the engine-specific storage allows us to
avoid reinterpret_casts from void* and to use smart pointers for
automatic memory management of objects with lifetime bound by the
command context.

This will be a two-part patch. This first part swaps out the underlying
void* storage with EngineStorageIface and ensures that memory
allocations are correctly accounted for, but it does not change the
interface of the (get|set)EngineStorage methods we use in
EventuallyPersistentEngine to acccess the stored data.

I will refactor those methods and their callers to EngineStorageIface
in a follow-up patch.

Line:741, daemon/cookie.h -> I don't think we want/need shared access to engine_storage (also folly::SharedMutex objects potentially slow down other instances of SharedMutex due to how they implement read looking) - so we can just use a std::mutex for the lock here.

Line:1845, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> It might be worth fixing this - i.e. add the Expect() here as that's how we expect things to work in production, and then fix any instances of storeEngineSpecific in tests where getCurrentEngine is null.

How many tests do you see failing when the check is present?

Line:1236, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Note for later in patch sequence - we should update these to dynamic_cast once everything issuing EpEngineSpecific.

Line:29, include/memcached/engine_storage.h -> What do we use this for?

Line:741, daemon/cookie.h -> Ack

Line:1845, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> I see the following failures if I do the `Expect()`. I believe this is all tests which use storeEngineSpecific (sync writes, range scans, etc.). 

The fix seems to be to add the allocation guard in the body of each individual unit test. GTest doesn't seem to provide a way to control how the generated TestBody is invoked, so it might be a manual process. Do we want those occurrences fixed?

Line:1236, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Ack

Line:29, include/memcached/engine_storage.h -> It is not used, but I thought it might be nice to be able to get to the type that is stored internally, for debug purposes in the future. Should I get rid of it?

Line:1845, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> So any unit test which is modelling a front-end thread calling ep-engine methods _should_ have set the current engine in the same way that the ep_engine "entry" functions do - e.g. acquireEngine() uses in ep_engine.cc

I would suggest looking at the SetUp() (and TearDown) methods for the test fixtures which are failing - it might only need fixing in a small number of parent classes.

Line:1845, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Because of how acquireEngine works, most ep-engine methods effectively end up doing switchToEngine(this) and switchToEngine(nullptr), so after the ep-engine method call is done, the memory domain is unconditionally reset. 

In test cases where we call engine methods and then some internal methods like on https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_durability_collections_dcp_test.cc#L263, the memory domain in VBucket::processResolvedSyncWrites is the non-bucket one. SyncWrites, compaction and range scans all use the engine specific storage, so if we were to assert the memory domain here, we would also need to update some of these tests.

I see 153 failing tests once I do that, but that figure includes test variants so it's not entirely accurate. I also had to guard all uses of the engine specific made directly in tests, which is about a dozen, but these 153 test are failing after those adjustments.

Line:1845, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Nod.

This is a bit tricky. I don't really want to add extra BucketAllocationGuard calls when we /should/ already have a bucket set (in production usage), partly for the cost (although it is small), and also for the complexity as we are not actually crossing between memory arenas here.

However, I also appreciate there's a bunch of tests which are technically "incorrect" (but it didn't matter previously) in that they make calls to the engine without currentEngine being set.

I think the most pragmatic approach is remove the BucketAllocationGuard here and raise a follow-up MB to add in an Expects() and fixup the broken tests.

Line:29, include/memcached/engine_storage.h -> Yeah I think so. One can always get the type in gdb anyway.
