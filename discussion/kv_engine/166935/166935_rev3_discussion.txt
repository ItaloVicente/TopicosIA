DESCRIPTION:

MB-49461: Allow MagmaKVStore to return a file handle even if DiskFull

MB-49461 showed that warmup can fail in a situation that the disk is
full.

This is due to a small window where we're able to successfully
create a MagmaKVStore without needing to be opened it in a ReadOnly
mode. But then the disk becomes full before run
Warmup::loadCollectionStatsForShard(). While running
loadCollectionStatsForShard() we try and create a KVFileHandle using
MagmaKVStore::makeFileHandle().

This fails as we're unable to Sync Magma's in memory state and disk.
This would normally be fine if we had opened Magma in a read only mode
as we would just return a ptr to an in memory snapshot. We should also
do this if Magma::SyncKVStore() returns Status::DiskFull, as we still
want to allow us to warmup so that a client can read data from
memcached.

We will also be okay in the situation the user tries to write data to
memcached as any further writes should fail and thus trigger us to
never enable traffic after we're warmed up. Also the KVFileHandle
returned will only ever be used for reading.

Can we also add a test for this?
Line:2431, engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Style - I think the structuring of this logic is a bit complex (admittedly it was before you got here) - the code is essentially "remembering" that it is allowed to continue here, then (at lines 2442 onwards) we try to reconstruct exactly why we were allowed to continue. 

In addition to being a bit hard to follow, the code is brittle - consider if we added a third case when a non-synced fileHandle is permitted. One would have to update the bool condition at line 2428, then also remember to add a case to lines 2443-2449. If one didn't to the latter the code would still compile but you'd get an incorrect warning message at line 2450.

I would suggest restructuring something along the lines of:

 auto status - magma->SyncKVStore();
 if (status) {
     status = magma->GetDiskSnapshot();
 } else {
     if (status.ErrorCode() == ReadOnly) {
         ... log message about creating in-memory snapst due to RO
         status = magma->GetSnapshot()
     } else if (status.ErrorCode() == DiskFull && !config.isReadOnly()
         ... log message about creating in-memory snap due to diskfull
         status = magma->GetSnapshot()
     } else {
         ... log message about unable to sync
         return nullptr;
     }
 }
 ... continue with checking status is ok; snapshot valid... 

As well as removing the repetition; this code "fails safely" - we explicitly check for the cases we currently support; the else() will return null (and not open anything). If there's an additional case added later where we support some other way of getting a snapshot, it would be much harder to get wrong as one only needs to update one part of the conditional.

Line:2434, engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Nit - I'd suggest adjusting this log message to tell the user what the consequence of this is - i.e say that a the file handle cannot be created.
