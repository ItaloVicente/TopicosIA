DESCRIPTION:

Make sure that the .compact file gets deleted

There is a number of failure paths during compaction failures
and we need to make sure that we delete the temporary file in
all of these cases. This is achieved by creating an instance
of a class which knows the filename and use the destructor
of the object to delete the file.
