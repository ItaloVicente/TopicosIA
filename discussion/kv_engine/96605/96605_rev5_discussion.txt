DESCRIPTION:

MB-30302: Spdlog style formatting for EP Engine (Code Changes)

Modification of SERVER_LOG_API and EP Engine to allow for spdlog style
formatting in EP Engine. Requires passing a pointer to the spdlog logger
object to create a new logger to format the log messages and prepend with
the engine name before using the original spdlog logger to print them.

Approach looks good - few implementation comments below.

I'd also suggest adding some testcases for the new macros - so we have something to test / use in isolation.

Take a look at the ep-engine tests/module_tests/ - you probably want something like a ep_logger_test; which tests the different macro variants.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: I'd probably omit "Code Changes" - pretty much all commits are code change; not changing code is the exception :)

Line:23, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.cc -> Is this constructor useful? Given that without an underlying spdLogger to log do; we can't actually log anything?

I assume you have this because you wanted to declare globalBucketLogger (and hence need a default constructor); but it's probably better to change that to be a pointer to a BucketLogger; and then construct (via the constructor which takes a spdlog::logger to wrap) when the engine is initialised.

Line:35, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.cc -> Similar to above; we probably don't need to handle assignment of BucketLoggers (I expect it shouldn't necessary); so simpler / safer to just delete the assignment operator (and copy constructor).

Line:39, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.cc -> Why is this needed? we are breaking encapsulation if have a public method giving access to the internal (wrapped) logger.

Line:51, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.cc -> Style: personally I'd write this in a more terse fashion - e.g.

 fmtString = "("s + engine->getName() + ')' + msg.raw;

Line:58, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.cc -> This looks like a bug - shouldn't this be `fmtString` ?

Line:20, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> I don't believe you need this #include here (given you don't use a concrete instance of log_msg; only a reference. You can instead just forward-declare log_msg. See https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#include-as-little-as-possible

Line:40, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> Please documenting this constructor; explaining what the `logger` argument is for.

Line:45, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> Style: When overriding virtual methods, use the `override` keyword (and omit `virtual` as it's implied). See http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rh-override

Line:60, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> Probably for a follow-up patch, but given that BucketLogger has it's own log level (by virtue of inheriting from spdlog::logger - see `msg_level`) we could move the Logger::shoudLog functionality into BuckeLogger; and use the base-class spdlog::logger::should_log() to handle whether or not a message should be logged.

Line:125, engines/ep/src/logger.cc -> As per my earlier comment; this is where I'd actually construct a BucketLogger; assigning it to the globalBucketLogger (which you could probably define as a unique_ptr to ensure it's deleted on shutdown).

Line:25, engines/ep/src/logger.h -> I don't think this header should be necessary - there's no new changes in this file which refer to any spdlog types...

Line:3, include/memcached/extension.h -> As previous; I don't think you need this.

Line:25, include/memcached/extension.h -> Whitespace-only change - please revert.

Line:44, include/memcached/extension.h -> I think we can probably come up with a better name for this than "EXTENSION_LOGGER_GETTER" / "loggerRef" which just feels a bit generic.

No harm in including "spdlog" or some variant to make it more explicit / separate from the old one.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:58, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.cc -> Not sure I follow - you're setting fmtString to "(No Engine)" + msg.raw; but then at line 43 you are passing `msg.raw` to log() - doesn't this mean we don't print "No Engine" anywhere?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:60, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> Decided to take this out now as it would also lead to modification of test cases to remove the import required. spdlog->log() overloads call shouldlog() and return early if false so doesn't seem to be much use in calling shouldlog() twice.

Line:3, include/memcached/extension.h -> Pretty sure it should; given you are only referring to a pointer to a type. Have another go; if you still have trouble ping me.
