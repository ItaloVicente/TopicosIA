DESCRIPTION:

MB-33904 Stop logging 'async log: thread pool doesn't exist anymore'

During cb::logger::shutdown() set the log level to level::off before we
call spdlog::details::registry::instance().shutdown() so that we do not
try and log after and during the shut down of an asynchronous spdlogger.
This will help mitigate against 'async log: thread pool doesn't exist
anymore' from being logged.

However, It's important to note that this will not disable logs for
DCPProducer loggers that are used for FTS and View connections.
As they are disconnected from the Spdlog registry straight after
creation. So in some situations "async log: thread pool doesn't
exist anymore" maybe logged by these loggers.

Also, refactor cb::logger::setLogLevels() so it uses spdlog's interface
spdlog::details::registry::instance().set_level() to change the current
log level. As this makes sure that we also modify the log level set in
the spdlog's registry as well as for each logger.

Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> Why do we care about the log level in the spdlog registry?

Line:238, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> if we need this, just make the actual pointer protected

Line:198, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_logger_test.cc -> why don't we just call cb::logger::get()->level? I think it's reasonable to assume that that logger is the underlying one. You can get rid of this entire class then

Line:225, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_logger_test.cc -> just compare the levels/numbers

Line:232, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_logger_test.cc -> if we have shut down then the file logger should be nullptr? I'd expect a heap use after free error here.

Line:234, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_logger_test.cc -> same as above

Line:249, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_logger_test.cc -> same as above

Line:265, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_logger_test.cc -> expect_eq(1,

Line:86, logger/spdlogger.cc -> should check with Dave if we actually want to do this, but could you not just chain into the default error handler after filtering out the "thread pool doesn't exist anymore" message?
