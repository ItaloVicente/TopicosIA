DESCRIPTION:

MB-33904 Stop logging 'async log: thread pool doesn't exist anymore'

During cb::logger::shutdown() set the log level to level::off before we
call spdlog::details::registry::instance().shutdown() so that we do not
try and log after and during the shut down of an asynchronous spdlogger.
This will help prevent the log message 'async log: thread pool doesn't
exist anymore' from being logged.

However, it is important to note that this will not disable logs for
DCPConsumer and DCPProducer loggers as they are disconnected from the
Spdlog registry straight after creation. So in some situations "async
log: thread pool doesn't exist anymore" maybe logged by these loggers.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: "reduce the likelihood of"

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> This doesn't disable logging for Views and FTS DCPProducers. All DCPConsumer logging should be disabled by this.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> may be

Line:220, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_logger_test.cc -> I think you can simplify the test by just calling cb::logger::shutdown then checking the level of the globalBucketLogger

Line:241, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_logger_test.cc -> Should use EXPECT_ instead of ASSERT_ for testing the expected result (so that we test all the conditions). ASSERT should be used for ensuring that the state is valid before testing something (as we break before testing if the assertion fires)

Line:71, logger/spdlogger.cc -> misleading

Line:74, logger/spdlogger.cc -> same comment as commit message

Line:220, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_logger_test.cc -> This unit test better reflects the behavior of the MB and thus provides us with extra checking out our behaviour in this situation. Just checking that the log level has been change seems somewhat doesn't give us the benefit of checking to make sure that this change has the desired change of behaviour that we expect.
