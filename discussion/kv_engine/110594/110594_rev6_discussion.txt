DESCRIPTION:

MB-33904 Stop logging 'async log: thread pool doesn't exist anymore'

During cb::logger::shutdown() set the log level to level::off before we
call spdlog::details::registry::instance().shutdown() so that we do not
try and log after and during the shut down of an asynchronous spdlogger.
This will help mitigate against 'async log: thread pool doesn't exist
anymore' from being logged.

However, It's important to note that this will not disable logs for
DCPProducer loggers that are used for FTS and View connections.
As they are disconnected from the Spdlog registry straight after
creation. So in some situations "async log: thread pool doesn't
exist anymore" maybe logged by these loggers.
