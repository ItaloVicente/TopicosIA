DESCRIPTION:

MB-33637: Fix memcached testapp ChangeVerbosity LoggingTest

This test is currently flawed for multiple reasons.

1) When run in non-embedded mode (every CV run) the test looks will
always pass because the cb::logger::checkLogLevels() call will look
in the registry belonging to the testapp process and not the
memcached process. This means that it will find no loggers to check
the verbosity of, and will always return true.

2) The test log levels are the wrong way around.

3) The test is racey. We might attempt to shut down the memcached
server before the thread that changes verbosity completes execution.
This thread will segfault when it logs if this is the case.

Fix this test by:

a) Forcing the test to run in embedded mode so that we can call
cb::logger::checkLogLevels(). This works without breaking other tests
because the LoggingTests are run as their own testsuite in ctest.

b) Fixing the log level mapping.

c) Runing the verbosity change in the memcached worker thread. It's
a quick operation that will only block if we are registering or
unregistered loggers (creating/destroying buckets/DCP connections).
Verbosity changing is also very infrequently used.
