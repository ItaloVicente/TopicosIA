DESCRIPTION:

MB-51639: Unconditionally persist disk snapshot end for HPS

Currently if we receive a disk snapshot with prepares in it we
persist the snapshot end as the HPS value, if we receive a
disk snapshot without prepares in it then we do not persist a
value for the HPS (i.e. it remains 0). This exposes us to the
following scenario:

1) Create cluster with 2 replicas
2) Perform 2 or more SyncWrites
3) One replica must receive fewer than the total number of SyncWrites
4) Other replica receives all SyncWrites and they are committed
5) Swap rebalance out the replica with all SyncWrites (4)
6) Restart new replica (5)
7) Failover active (behind replica (3) is promoted and the missing
   writes are lost permanently when new replica (5) rolls back on
   reconnection)
