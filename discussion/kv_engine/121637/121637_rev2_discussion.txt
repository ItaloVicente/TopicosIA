DESCRIPTION:

MB-37096: Debug CRT: Reduce ep_testsuite default #vbuckets to 4

ep_testsuite tests run quite slowly under Windows Debug CRT, frequently
hitting the test suite timeout when run on CV machines.

Profiling highlights that one reason for this is initializing and then
destroying each engine instance, specifically data for all 1024 vBuckets
which _could_ be used, however few fests use more than 1 or 2.

Change the default maximum number of vBuckets in ep_testsuite tests from
1024 to 4. This reduces the runtime of the ep_testsuite suite from 197s
to 134s under Windows Debug config.
