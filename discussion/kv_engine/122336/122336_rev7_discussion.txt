DESCRIPTION:

Add schedule_dcp_step to cookie interface

In order to tighten the logic for when cookies get notified
we'll start off by adding a method which should be used by
DCP in order to make sure that the step() method gets called
again.

This allows us to verify the 1:1 mapping between the engine
returning EWOULDBLOCK and a notify_io_complete, and that DCP
consumers stick to the contract that they need to reserve
the cookie before they can call schedule_dcp_step (and that
they don't use it after they've called release).
