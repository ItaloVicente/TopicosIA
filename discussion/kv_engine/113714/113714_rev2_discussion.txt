DESCRIPTION:

Refactor expelUnreferencedCheckpointItems to use min_element

Minor refactor for readability. Not a required change, but as we now
restrict expelling to the oldest checkpoint we can simplify the logic
slightly, shortening the method somewhat without (hopefully) losing any
clarity.

Also avoids some bouncing weak/shared pointers.
