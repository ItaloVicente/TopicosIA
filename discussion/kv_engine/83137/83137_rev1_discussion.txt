DESCRIPTION:

MB-25931: Fetch value when expiring meta only items

If the expiry code encounters an xattr item with no value we must
fetch the value before running the pre_expiry hook. This fetch is done
inline in the deleteExpiredItem function which is running on an AUXIO
background task.

Core of the fix looks good - couple of minor comments on improving how we handle get() failures.
Line:594, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> I believe parameter this is actually fetchDelete; and it already defaults to false so you could emit it if you chose.

Line:599, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Not sure if "warning" is the most suitable level here - in theory you could legitimately see this if the document has been deleted since the pager ran, so we might see a lot of instances in the log.

Two thoughts:

1. Simply drop the level to say NOTICE.
2. Change the get() call above to fetchDeletes=true; and then check if the document was deleted - if true then that's expected and we can just return (without logging a message). If the get fails then that *is* unexpected, and we can log at WARNING.

Line:672, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> Might be worth expanding the comment to give some commentary on the scenario we are trying to setup.

Line:696, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> Not totally clear what the purpose of this call is - to trigger the Expiry Pager?

Line:696, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> inherited from Sriram, I've removed and it still runs/fails
