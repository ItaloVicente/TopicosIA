DESCRIPTION:

MB-44539: More efficient generation of collection stats document ID

Profiling a workload which was writing to 1k collections and it was
noted that CollectionID::to_string was relatively high (top 20)for
the writer threads (as part of the collection stat update). This
function was originally intended for debug use but is used in the
generation of the local document ID, and it's not the most efficient
way to generate 0x<cid>.

For CouchKVStore a new method is added which uses fmt to generate the
entire document name in one call. With this change, the generation of
document names has disappeared from the profile.

Additionally the CollectionID::to_string is updated to use the more
efficient formatter.

Line:209, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> CollectionID to_string() used to return "0xa" but this will return "a" is this a deliberate change?
