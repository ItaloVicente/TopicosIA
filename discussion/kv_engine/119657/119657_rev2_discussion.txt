DESCRIPTION:

MB-37294: Avoid starvation of low-pri VBs in Flusher::flushVB()

+Summary+

Commit 1f64b646719dacba8aa78b1101647a56ae94bbb8 modified the Flusher
to use VBReadyQueue to manage the low-priority VBuckets waiting to be
flushed. However, this change introduced a starvation issue for
low-priority vBuckets if there are outstanding high-priority vBuckets
which are still awaiting seqno_persisence.

+Details+

Consider the following scenario:

1. At least one SEQNO_PERSISTENCE request is outstanding -
   VBucket::hpVBReqs is non-empty for at least one vBucket.

2. This vbucket does not yet have the seqno requested - for example
   it's a replica vBucket and memory usage is high and replication to
   it has been throttled.
3. At least one other (low priority) vBucket is awaiting flushing.

The consequence is that the low-priority vBucket will never get
flushed (not until the high priority vBucket completes it's
seqno_persistence). This can lead to livelock - if we actually _could_
flush the low-priority vBucket(s) then that would allow
CheckpointMemory to be freed (expelling / removing closed,
unreferenced checkpoints).

The actual problem is the logic in Flusher::flushVB(). This is a
(needlessly?) complex function, but the high level logic involves
switching between two modes (Flusher::doHighPriority):

A) While there are no outstanding SEQNO_PERSISTENCE vBuckets for this
   shard, flush the next vBucket in lpVbs (low priority). Reschedule
   (return true) if there's any more low-priority VBs to flush.

B) If there are outstanding SEQNO_PERSISTENCE vBuckets for this shard:
   1) If hpVBs (high priority vbs) is empty, populate the hpVBs queue
      with all vBuckets with outstanding SEQNO_PERSISTENCE requests.

   2) Flush the next vb from hpVBs, Reschdule (return true) if there
      are any more items in hpVBs.

   3) Once all outstanding SEQNO_PERSISTENCE vBuckets have been
      flushed, allow an equal number of low-priority vBuckets to be
      flushed before retrying the outstanding SEQNO_PERSISTENCE vBuckets.

Step B.3 is crucial to avoid starvation of the low-priority queue -
without this step, then a single slow VBucket with an outstanding
SEQNO_PERSISTENCE request can prevent _all_ other vBuckets in the
shard from being flushed.

However, when the aforementioned path to use VBReadyQueue was
introduced, it inadvertantly prevented step B.3 from actually
occurring.

This is because when re-entering Flusher::flushVB after flushing the
last high priority VB from hpVBs (i.e. after step B.2), we incorrectly
only check if hpVbs.empty() is true, and if so set doHighPriority to
false - i.e. going back to mode A.

The fix is restore the logic from before the patch - only switch back
to mode A (doHighPriority=false) when both low and high priority VB
queues are empty.
