DESCRIPTION:

NonStickyList

A variant of std::list where an iterator pointing to end() is not
"sticky" - i.e. if more items are added to the list, then the iterator
can access them if advanced:

    | 1 | 2 | 3 |

    ^           ^
  begin        it (current end)

push_back(4):

    | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |

    ^           ^
  begin        it

This is implemented by adding an extra sentinal element at the start
of the list, and having iterator derefenece actually return the next
item:

    Logical View:

      begin        end
        |           |
        +---+       +---+
            |           |
            v           v

        | S | 1 | 2 | 3 |

        ^           ^
      begin        end

    Physical View:

This means that when the user has an iterator logically end(); it's
the underlying iterator physically still pointing a real element (3 in
the example above). As such, if another element is appended to the
list, then `it` can still be advanced to it.
