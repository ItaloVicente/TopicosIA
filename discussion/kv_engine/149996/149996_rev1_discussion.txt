DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Update vbuckets with collections earlier in warmup

Warmup has code which will ensure that active vbuckets
are equal with the bucket's view collections. This exists
so that if KV has responded success to set_collections
but then warmed-up, vbuckets don't come back with old
collection state.

However this code should be earlier in warmup, before the
vbucket is added to the vbmap. This makes it much easier
to reason about when considering various failure scenarios.

For example in the previous implementation, we may of signalled
success to set_collections and dropped a collection. But then a
window exists in warmup where that collection maybe visible. It
is simpler to reason about failure (especially quorum loss) if
the collection state is synced whilst the vbucket is not visible.

Line:1318, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> hmm, this feels like it should be before the collection call, which i've added before addBucket. Is there a reason why queue comes after addBucket?

Line:1318, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> i think the callback to notify the flusher requires the vb to be in the map

Line:1318, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Ben's right, though I've swiched it around in http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/147349 by creating an unlocked version of the flusher so we can persist the vbstate without having to add it to the vbmap.

Line:1318, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> hmm, but the flusher may not run immediately after dropping the vb lock, I thought it's more important that the vbstate is queued before data. If we need the flusher to run, then we probably need Richard's suggestion and just run the flusher inline

Line:1318, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> For the vbstate we don't need it to run immediately after dropping the lock. We need the vbstate in there with the first mutation (to prevent seqnos increasing without failover entry), but a clean shutdown will guarantee that it gets flushed, and an unclean shutdown will generate another failover entry

Line:1318, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> yep - didn't see his was in flight/not committed. Probably rebase this one then once Richard's is merged
