DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Update vbuckets with collections earlier in warmup

Warmup has code which will ensure that active vbuckets
are equal with the bucket's view collections. This exists
so that if KV has responded success to set_collections
but then warmed-up, vbuckets don't come back with old
collection state.

However this code should be earlier in warmup, before the
vbucket is added to the vbmap. This makes it much easier
to reason about when considering various failure scenarios.

For example in the previous implementation, we may of signalled
success to set_collections and dropped a collection. But then a
window exists in warmup where that collection maybe visible. It
is simpler to reason about failure (especially quorum loss) if
the collection state is synced whilst the vbucket is not visible.

Line:165, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/manifest_update_test.cc -> side effect of this commit (a good one I think) is that now we sync the vbucket's collection state before loading keys. In this test it means the dropped 'apple' key now is not loaded, whereas previously it was loaded into memory, but ignored by "isLogicallyDeleted" check inside VBucket::getInternal. This test now has to do bgFetch for full eviction to show the key is not there
