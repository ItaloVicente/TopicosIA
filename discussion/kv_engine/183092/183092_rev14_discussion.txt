DESCRIPTION:

MB-54640: Add support for client connection information

Allow the administrator to get information of client connections:

    ./mcstat --user Administrator --password asdfasdf \
             --json=pretty client_connection_details

    {
      "127.0.0.1": {
        "last_used": "8904 us",
        "current": 31,
        "disconnect": 0,
        "total": 39
      },
      "172.17.0.1": {
        "last_used": "89 ms",
        "current": 1,
        "disconnect": 0,
        "total": 1
      }
    }

By this functionality is _disabled_ by default and the operator
needs to explicitly enable it by inserting the following entry
with a number != 0 in memcached.json:

    "max_client_connection_details": <number>

The number specifies the maximum number of uniqe IP addresses
each front end thread should keep information about.

Why do you need to worry about that? memory and efficiency.
If we don't set a limit this map could in theory contain all
possible IPv4 AND IPv6 addresses (not very likely, but you get
the point). If we set it to 100 it wouldn't work well for people
who try to use it with 101 app servers etc.

Under the covers each front end thread creates a map looking
like:

   [ip] - [details]

When a connection gets created on the server the front
end thread starts by checking if it has any knowledge
of the connecting IP. If it has that it'll just update
the entry. If this is a new entry it'll check to see
if the number of entries is below the max number it'll
create a new entry. If the map is full it'll try to scan
the map to see if there is an entry with 0 current connections
and replace that entry with the new IP. If there is no
entry to evict it'll simply _IGNORE_ the connection.

As you probably spotted this have few "problems":

1) When we evict an entry what we return is no longer really
   accurate as thread 1 may evict an entry for an IP thread 2
   still has an entry for. The "current" count reported for
   that IP would be correct, but the total and forced disconnect
   is incorrect. (This could have been solved by having a
   shared data structure, but that introduce locking and
   other problems)

2) Scanning the table to find someone to evict is costly
   (and even worse if there is nothing to evict).
