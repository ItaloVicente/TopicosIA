DESCRIPTION:

Add CookieIface::getConnectionId()

The logging in memcached typically put the connection identifier
in the beginning of the log entry, but most of the times we
operate on a cookie and in order to get it we would have to
call:

   getConnection().getId()

Now that we've changed the engine interface to pass along a
CookieIface the underlying engine could also get the connection
identifier without having to go through the "get_log_info" method
in the server API
