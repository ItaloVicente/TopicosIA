DESCRIPTION:

MB-37187: Rethrow a more useful exception in dcp_replicator runloop

Currently if we catch an exception in the dcp_replicator runloop then
we will rethrow it if it was not expected. When we do so we lose both
the exception type and message and rethrow an empty std::exception.

Rethrow a runtime_error exception instead with the message of the
original exception to at least preserve the exception message.
