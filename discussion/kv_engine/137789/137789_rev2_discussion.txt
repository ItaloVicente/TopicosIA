DESCRIPTION:

MB-41857: Track the .compact file against the file cache limit

Currently we don't track the .compact file against the file limit for
CouchKVStores which means we could go above the limit and run out of
files. Track the file against the limit with a simple RAII handle as
changing the couchstore API is a lot more effort.
