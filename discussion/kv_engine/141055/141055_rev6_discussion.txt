Line:892, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_test.cc -> operator[] does not increase the size of the vector to accomodate the new item - emplace_back or push_back might be better.

Could just add an initial call to resize(N) - but then the number of items has to be kept in sync with the actual number of elements added
