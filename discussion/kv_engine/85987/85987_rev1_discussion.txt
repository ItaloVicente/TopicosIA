DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: [3/N] Implement Tagged Pointer for SingleThreadedRCPtr

To improve out hash table eviction algorithm we need to hold more state
regarding when and how often documents in the cache are accessed.

However we do not want to increase the memory usage, especially as the
increase will be multiplied by every entry held in the hash table.

Given we maintain a 64-bit pointer to a StoredValue for each entry in
the hash table, on x86 architectures we can use the top 16-bits for our
own use.  This is because x86 only use the bottom 48 bits for
addressing.

This patch introduces a tagged SingleThreadedRCPtr class, which has the
ability to act as a pointer, as well as hold 16-bit of user data.  This
class is used for the value pointer in a StoredValue.
