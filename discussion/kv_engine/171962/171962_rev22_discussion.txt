File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Over all comment is this patch is quite large atm, I wander if it would make more sense if were where able to split it out on a per-testsuite bases?
Line:36, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/collections_dcp_test.h -> Does it make sense to have two versions of this function, one that just for the helper cusrsor and another that takes any cursor?

Line:58, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> can't you just use flushVBucketToDiskIfPersistent() here?

Line:4495, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Nit: where are we registering the cursor?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might be good to comment on the patten of the sort of things that require being fixed in the patch to get the tests to run as there's quite a few changes that are non obvious why they're needed.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> That's because SingleThreadedKVBucketTest covers many subclasses.
This is always exactly the same test fix everywhere though, so logically the patch isn't big
Line:36, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/collections_dcp_test.h -> Sure, I think we can do that if at some points we need the other version anywhere

Line:58, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> IIRC that one expects at least 1 item to persist, it fails otherwise, that's why this custom call here

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Also note, splitting in multiple patches would mean first spreading the existing (Lazy) test configuration to all the subclasses, and then touching each subclass one by one. That seems unnecessary for what I said before :)
