DESCRIPTION:

MB-51295: SingleThreadedKVBucketTest from Lazy to Eager ckpt removal

That's the first step required for removing Lazy.
This patch addresses SingleThreadedKVBucketTest and all its subclasses.
There's a common pattern through every change here:
 - whether the test verifies a case where the assumption is checkpoints
   aren't removed from CM -> test fixed by preventing checkpoint
   removal (eg, by placing some cursor)
 - or the test makes some unnecessary assumption on the number of
   checkpoints in CM -> those are usally just paranoid/unneeded
   assertions that we can remove.. or fix in some case
