File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Partial review up to dcp_durability_stream_test.cc
Line:739, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> Nit: If this is a precondition for the test it should be ASSERT.

Line:758, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.cc -> has

Line:36, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/collections_dcp_test.h -> Nit: the name of the function doesn't say where it gets moved to, so without the comment it's not very clear.

Perhaps rename to `moveHelperCursorToCkptMgrEnd` or similar?

Line:27, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Nit: If we are including ep_bucket.h we don't need kv_bucket.h

Line:4725, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> I see this pattern in a few places - maybe move into a helper function?
