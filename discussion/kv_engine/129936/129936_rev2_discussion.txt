DESCRIPTION:

MB-39618: Use coarse clock for CappedDurationVBucketVisitor

CappedDurationVBucketVisitor::pauseVisitor() determines if it should
pause by calling steady_clock::now() and comparing it to the start
time, to see if the visitor has run for too long.

For tasks which either (a) run frequently or (b) spend little time per
VBucket, the number of calls to steady_clock::now() can be
significant. In the case of DurabilityTimeoutTask, it runs every 25ms,
and on a cluster with zero SyncWrites currently in progress it will
have little work to do when visiting a VBucket. As such, both (a) and
(b) are true for it.

steady_clock::now() is implemented on Linux using
clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC). This is _normally_ a very fast call,
using the VDSO to return a result without having a make a syscall in
the common case. As such, the large number of steady_clock::now()
calls are not an issue.

However, under certain environments clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) is
*not* fast - for example if the 'HPET' clocksource is in use - a full
syscall is required. This is the case in the original MB linked, where
Docker for Mac was using HPET in it's embedded Linux VM. However HPET
could also be used in other environments - it has been seen in the
past on cloud-based virtualization platforms

This results in a significant increase in the idle CPU of memcached
(specifically the NonIO threads servicing the DurabilityTimeoutTask) -
 the OP's environment 3 idle, empty Buckets went from ~15% CPU to
150% CPU.

To address this, change the clock used by CappedDurationVBucketVisitor
to one backed by clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE) (on
Linux). This is an altenative clock which only gives 1 millisecond
resolution, *but* crucually can always be handled in userspace[1]
without having to make a syscall (even when HPET is in use).

This reduces the CPU overhead back to the original 15%.
