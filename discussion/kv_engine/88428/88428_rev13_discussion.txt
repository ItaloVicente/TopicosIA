DESCRIPTION:

MB-27457: [7/n] Update the dcp_deletion protocol and executors/validators

Update the protocol so that the update to DCP deletion has its own
clear packet definition (v2), update the validators and executor
callbacks so that we can send and receive the new packet definitions.

Note: Externally no client can yet enable 'delete-time' as the
dcp_open command is still stripping that flag from the open command.

(4 comments)

Again, just a few minor comments.
Line:396, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> Nit: can be const.

Line:1683, include/memcached/protocol_binary.h -> Note: We should probably think about moving things like these methods outside of the header and to a .cc in a follow-up; the header is getting pretty big now...

Line:1877, tests/mcbp/mcbp_test.cc -> Perhaps a little misleading to make V2 inherit from Request; given they have different underlying `request` representations. 

What about making a separate RequestV1 sibling, and converting Request to an abstract base class?

Line:1963, tests/mcbp/mcbp_test.cc -> Would be cleaner to have symbolic constants for these two values seeing as they keep popping up in various places.
