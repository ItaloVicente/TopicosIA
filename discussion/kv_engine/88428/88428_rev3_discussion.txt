DESCRIPTION:

MB-27457: [7/n] Update the dcp_deletion protocol and executors/validators

Update the protocol so that the update to DCP deletion has its own
clear packet definition (v2), update the validators and executor
callbacks so that we can send and receive the new packet definitions.

Note: Externally no client can yet enable 'delete-time' as the
dcp_open command is still stripping that flag from the open command.
