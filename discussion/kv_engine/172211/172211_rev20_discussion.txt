Rather than setting stats to their initial values in both
the constructor and in the reset() method, make the constructor call
reset() instead.

Line:261, engines/ep/src/stats.cc -> bgMinWait & bgMinLoad defaults have changed here compared to setting in ctor (where they were zero).

As per previous comments, clearly we cannot have both a single reset and the same behaviour as before, so what to do...?

Given that we already have histograms for bgWait and bgLoad times (and hence min / max are redundant), I propose we just remove these four stats and avoid the issue entirely :).

Can you create a new MB for that (so we can track it separately), and then remove the stats before this patch?
