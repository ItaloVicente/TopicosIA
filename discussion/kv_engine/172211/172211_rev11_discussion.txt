DESCRIPTION:

MB-33549: Refactor cbstats ctor to call reset()

Rather than setting stats to their initial values in both
the constructor and in the reset() method, make the constructor call
reset() instead.

Also standardize itemAllocSizeHisto's definition in line with the
other histograms by moving its definition to hdrhistogram.h.

Line:243, engines/ep/src/stats.cc -> What's the order of these members now? The same as listed in the class declaration?

Line:356, engines/ep/src/stats.cc -> Your editor/ env  seems to have stripped the newline from this file.

Normally `git commit` will add it, so not sure how it's been removed here...

Line:243, engines/ep/src/stats.cc -> Ack.

The existing state obviously isn't ideal. I would suggest keeping the members in the same order as they were before (assuming they were present) - for example move bg_fetched, bgNumOperations etc back to after numNotMyVBuckets.

Line:243, engines/ep/src/stats.cc -> Good point, the ordering of these seems mostly random, whereas the constructor enforced the same ordering as the class declaration.

These can be rearranged, but the change will be more difficult to read.

Line:243, engines/ep/src/stats.cc -> Oops, was meant to be that way initially. Not sure how that happened. Done.
