DESCRIPTION:

MB-33549: refactor cbstats ctor to call reset()

Rather than setting stats to their initial values in both
the constructor and in the reset() method, make the constructor call
reset() instead.

This requires itemAllocSizeHisto's definition to be factored out of
stats.h and into hdrhistogram.h (in line with the other histograms), to
make sure it is initialized properly.
