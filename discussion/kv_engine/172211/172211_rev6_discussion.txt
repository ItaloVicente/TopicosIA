DESCRIPTION:

MB-33549: refactor cbstats ctor to call reset()

Rather than setting stats to their initial values in both
the constructor and in the reset() method, make the constructor call
reset() instead.

Also standardize itemAllocSizeHisto's definition in line with the
other histograms by moving its definition to hdrhistogram.h.
