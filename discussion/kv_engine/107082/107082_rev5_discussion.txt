DESCRIPTION:

MB-33333: Modify SeqnoAcknowledged to take prepared_seqno

Update DCP_SEQNO_ACKNOWLEDGED message and related methods to take a
single prepared_seqno argument instead of the previous in-memory and
on-disk seqnos.

Given the DurabilityMonitor still tracks both in-memory and on-disk
(and doesn't yet have a unified prepared_seqno), temporarily use the
'on_disk_seqno' for prepared_seqno. This is "correct", in that
anything which has been written to disk must have met its (local)
durability requirements, but is a pessimisation for level=majority or
majorityAndPersistActive. However it allows the interface to be
migrated to the new, single prepared_seqno and have the
DurabilityMonitor be updated in parallel / later.

A couple of tests had to be disabled while in this transition phase,
these will be re-enabled once DurabilityMonitor conversion is
complete.
