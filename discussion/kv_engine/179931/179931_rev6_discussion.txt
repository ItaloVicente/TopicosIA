DESCRIPTION:

MB-53657: Notify DCP frontend if cursor jumps into new checkpoint

A new open checkpoint might be created in two code paths:

1. Frontend, queueDirty()
2. Background, checkpoint memory recovery

While at (1) we correctly notify DCP connection, we miss that at (2).
The consequence is that DCP cursors migth get stuck at the empty item
in checkpoints like [e cs), and DCP item remaining stats never dropping
to 0.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> I think it's worth expanding this comment to explain where this bug comes from (i.e. I believe the recent getNumItems... changes) as at the moment the implication is this is something which has been broken for a long time, which I don't believe is the case.
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I'm not sure the way you are currently notifying the ActiveStream is the best way to achieve this.

Repeating a specific comment from active_stream.cc at the top here:

> This logic seems a bit backward - we've called all the way down into ActiveStream passing it a std::function condition which is going to call code on the ActiveStream object itself - i.e. it's nothing that notifySeqnoAvailable couldn't check itself.

> I think this would be better if we just added a new ActiveStream::notifyNewCheckpoint() method or similar, which the stream can decide itself if it wants to act on - i.e. by checking if it's cursor is currently on the empty item at the end of the previous checkpoint or similar.

> That gets rid of the lambda (which you aren't really using for anything other than this specific case), and all the encapsulation breaking between producer & active stream etc.

Line:118, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Can we predicate this on whether we actually created a new checkpoint - to avoid a bunch of unnecessary calls into notifyReplication (and potentially unnecessary stream notifies if for example they were already positioned on the empty item).

Line:1616, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> This logic seems a bit backward - we've called all the way down into ActiveStream passing it a std::function condition which is going to call code on the ActiveStream object itself - i.e. it's nothing that notifySeqnoAvailable couldn't check itself.

I think this would be better if we just added a new ActiveStream::notifyNewCheckpoint() method or similar, which the stream can decide itself if it wants to act on - i.e. by checking if it's cursor is currently on the empty item at the end of the previous checkpoint or similar.

That gets rid of the lambda (which you aren't really using for anything other than this specific case), and all the encapsulation breaking between producer & active stream etc.

Line:14, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.h -> Active stream is not a small header - we should avoid pulling it into other common headers like dcpconnmap to keep compile times down.

Suggest moving ActiveStream::StreamNofifyCondition type elsewhere (you could also forward-declare it if you weren't defining a default value for it - possibly an argument for two overloads of notifyVBConnections() ?

Line:14, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> Producer shouldn't have active_stream.h in the interface; that's breaking encapsulation.

Similar comment to previous; we should move StreamNotifyCondition elsewhere / or overload notifySeqnoAvailable and forward-declare.

Line:393, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> I don't think getNextItem should be public - why the change?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> ... alternatively, if you just want a minimal fix in asap, just call notifyReplication with the existing signature if a new checkpoint is created - it's potentially notifying more than strictly necessary, but we don't recover memory _that_ often (v.s. new items being added via queueDirty) so in the short term it's fine and you can follow up with an optimised version to only wakeup when necessary.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Done
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> > alternatively

Yes I had already thought about putting in that kind of small/quick fix and then optimize the overall thing later. I'm fine with that if that feels the better way to go at this time.
Line:118, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> > Can we predicate this on whether we actually created a new checkpoint - to avoid a bunch of unnecessary calls into notifyReplication

Sure - Just to clarify, that wouldn't completely avoid unnecessary calls as the creation of a new checkpoint doesn't imply that some cursor was moved into it.

> and potentially unnecessary stream notifies if for example they were already positioned on the empty item

We shouldn't have any unnecessary stream notify in that case. If a cursor is already placed on the empty item then:

  1. We are already in the process of running the DCP loop for that stream - In that case our code prevents double notifications
  2. Or, the DCP loop needs to be triggered anyway as we need to jump onto the checkpoint_start item.

Line:1616, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> So yes all the point of this kind of change is reusing the existing notify() API and avoiding adding a second path for the same.

But fine for me on a new ActiveStream::notifyNewCheckpoint() if that feels cleaner.

Line:14, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.h -> Yeah I can move StreamNofifyCondition to some other header.
Or adding a new ActiveStream::notifyNewCheckpoint() as per other comment.

Line:14, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> Same

Line:393, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.h -> Just for testing. Reverted to protected and properly exposed via MockDcpProducer.

Line:1616, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Some extra context here.

The main reason for the structure of this change is the notify() API with a bunch of collateral issues around it.

 1. We need to notify a Producer/Stream pair when the related cursor moves into a new checkpoint
 2. For precise/quick identification of the Prod/Stream pair we would need some Cursor->Stream lookup mechanism that we don't have.
 3. Even if we introduce that, we can't call-back into the Stream from CM as we can't acquire queueLock->streamMutex. That's because the opposite streamMutex->queueLock is the main pattern in the code, so that would introduce potential-lock-by-lock-inversion.
 4. So, whatever we do we need to release the queueLock before notifying the stream.
 5. As a consequence of (4), once we leave the CM code we have lost the information on what's the precise stream to notify. So that information should be returned to the caller.
 6. ..

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> We agreed to put in the quick-fix.
I'm pushing that in a dedicated patch as I want to keep this one alive. At some point I'll revive this one for an optimized/finer-grained notify mechanism.
