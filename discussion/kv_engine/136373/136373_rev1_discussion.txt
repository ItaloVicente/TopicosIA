DESCRIPTION:

MB-31869: Make ConnMap::connNotifier const

At http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/101187 we introduce a code
path that accesses the ConnNotifier from a bgthread.
That leads to a data-race between create-bucket (fethread) and some of
the task executed in bgthreads (eg, PagingVisitor).

The problem is that currently the ConnMap initialization is split in 2
phases: the ctor and the initialize() method. In particular,
ConnMap::connNotifier is contructed in ConnMap::initialize(), which
is executed *after* the EP ExecutorPool and some tasks (eg,
PagingVisitor) are up and running.
When we introduce a call to ConnMap from a bgthread, that races with the
bucket creation on ConnMap::connNotifier.

Given that ConnMap::connNotifier is intrinsically const, then make it
so and construct it in ConnMap ctor. No further synchronization is
required to guard the lifetime of that member.
