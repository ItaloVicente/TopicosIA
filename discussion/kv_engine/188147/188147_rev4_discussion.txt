DESCRIPTION:

MB-55943: Add test for the new default auto_pid configuration

The updated value for the proportional terms was chosen to be the value
which given minSleep for fragmentation at upper_threshold and maxSleep
for fragmentation at lower_threshold when the integral term is 0.

This essentially makes the auto_pid behaviour the same as that of the
auto_linear mode in the initial state of the PID controller.

Add a test to make sure we're always in line with that, to guard against
inconsistent changes to the parameters this value was computed from.
