DESCRIPTION:

MB-51719: CBStatCollector::formatKey Simplify dynamic format args handling

As per comments in CBStatCollector::formatKey helper function
formatFromMap, the handling of dynamic format arguments is signicanlty
simpler with the introduction of dynamic labelled arguments in fmtlib
8 - see https://fmt.dev/latest/api.html#named-arguments

Remove the somewhat complex manual handling of this and delegate to
fmtlib.
