DESCRIPTION:

MB-38031: Update vbstate json parsing to support optional fields

In the MB a specific upgrade path occurs, 4.6.5 -> 5.1.3 -> 6.5.x

Importantly, 5.1.3 is just a stepping stone to 6.5.x and no data is
written. When this occurs the vbstate (_local document) will be
missing fields which were added between 4.6.5 and 6.5.x

* hlc_epoch
* might_contain_xattrs

So these fields should not be treated as required/expected and are
optional.

This patch also makes "namespaces_supported" optional, it is an expected
field but that expectation is handled in warmup.
