DESCRIPTION:

MB-48531: Checkpoint Remover deallocates in place

The Remover is resposible for CursorDrop. When checkpoints are
unreferened they are currently moved to the Destroyer for deallocation.

That is blocker for what I need to do in follow-up patches for allowing
multiple Removers.

When more than one Remover exist, they need some way to synchronize on
the memory-release-target to ensure that we don't start dropping all
cursors with no reason.
There are obviously multiple ways of achieving that synchronization,
but the simples is to just make every Remover reading the state of the
existing/global KVBucket::getRequiredCheckpointMemoryReduction() at
every iteration and yield once that returns 0.

The current problem with KVBucket::getRequiredCheckpointMemoryReduction
is that stats are updated only when checkpoints are actually freed.
Which doens't happen in the Remover currently.
