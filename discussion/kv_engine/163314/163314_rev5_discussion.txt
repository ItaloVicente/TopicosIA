DESCRIPTION:

MB-48531: Checkpoint Remover deallocates in place

The Remover is resposible for CursorDrop. When checkpoints are
unreferened they are currently moved to the Destroyer for deallocation.

That is blocker for what I need to do in follow-up patches for allowing
multiple Removers.

When more than one Remover exist, they need some way to synchronize on
the memory-release-target to ensure that we don't start dropping all
cursors with no reason.
There are obviously multiple ways of achieving that synchronization,
but the simples is to just make every Remover reading the state of the
existing/global KVBucket::getRequiredCheckpointMemoryReduction() at
every iteration and yield once that returns 0.

The current problem with KVBucket::getRequiredCheckpointMemoryReduction
is that stats are updated only when checkpoints are actually freed.
Which doens't happen in the Remover currently.

Line:189, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> @reviewers

This API is used only by (1) CheckpointRemoverTask and (2) PagingVisitor.
(1) wants ImmediateDisposer and (2) wants deferred-disposer.
Plan is to remove any ckpt-logic from (2), so at that point the arg itself can be removed and the func's default/only behaviour will be immediate-disposing.

Also, using a default arg value for avoiding touching many lines in tests

Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not true of all the stats - and you could totally change any stats of interest to update at the time they are detached (detachFromManager(), which occurs under eager and lazy checkpoint removal), if that's becoming inconvenient.

Line:189, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> So we're heading back to multiple actors in charge of checkpoint destruction, and interdependency between config values (i.e., whatever config value scales the CURU task has different behaviour under eager and lazy). This is fine, but just wanting to check that this is the state of play.

Line:189, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> My position here is that we should have a single entity responsible for disposing of checkpoints. 

From what James says, you don't _need_ to dispose of immediately, there's stats available to allow you to account for how much memory will be freed once the Checkpoint is later destroyed. I think that's a better approach in terms of trying to give each task9actor a narrow, well-defined set of roles and responsibilities.

Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> The relevant stat I'm referring to is EPStats::estimatedCheckpointMemory, which is decreased only in when a Checkpoint id destroyed.
Changing that stat to update when the Checkpoints are still around would introduce another level of approximation that I didn't want to add to something that is already an "estimate" by definition.

Line:189, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> As we discussed offline, we all agree on having a single place for deallocation.
But stats work in a way that doesn't allow that today.
See my other comments on stats.

Line:189, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Please note also that the CheckpointRemover is already doing sync deallocation for ItemExpel.
And note that we are not moving deallocation from background to frontend, we are just keeping deallocs in the original bg-task.
Also, the original bg-task is being sharded too, so we aren't losing any concurrent capability.

Not sure I get that, this task will do synch deallocation regardless of eager/lazy

Agreed to make EPStats::checkpointMemUsage to be decremented as soon as a Checkpoint is detached from the original CheckpointManaget. That will allow to use EPStats::checkpointMemUsage as synch-point across concurrent CheckpointRemover Tasks
