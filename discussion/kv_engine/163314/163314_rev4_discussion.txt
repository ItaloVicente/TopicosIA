DESCRIPTION:

MB-48531: Checkpoint Remover deallocates in place

The Remover is resposible for CursorDrop. When checkpoints are
unreferened they are currently moved to the Destroyer for deallocation.

That is blocker for what I need to do in follow-up patches for allowing
multiple Removers.

When more than one Remover exist, they need some way to synchronize on
the memory-release-target to ensure that we don't start dropping all
cursors with no reason.
There are obviously multiple ways of achieving that synchronization,
but the simples is to just make every Remover reading the state of the
existing/global KVBucket::getRequiredCheckpointMemoryReduction() at
every iteration and yield once that returns 0.

The current problem with KVBucket::getRequiredCheckpointMemoryReduction
is that stats are updated only when checkpoints are actually freed.
Which doens't happen in the Remover currently.

Line:103, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Note that this will always return zero under eager checkpoint removal, which is the default going forwards.
When checkpoints are detached (under either checkpoint removal mode) CM::getEstimatedMemUsage()/other stats will change, without having to force destruction of the checkpoints in-line.
With appropriate synchronisation the stats may be a more general way of monitoring changes in the CM.

I know, in fact the only reason for having this is keeping the CB_DEVELOPMENT_ASSERTS below at line 213

#if CB_DEVELOPMENT_ASSERTS
    else {
        // if eager checkpoint removal has been configured, calling
        // attemptCheckpointRemoval here should never, ever, find any
        // checkpoints to remove; they should always be removed as soon
        // as they are made eligible, before the lock is released.
        // This is not cheap to verify, as it requires scanning every
        // vbucket, so is only checked if dev asserts are on.
        Expects(attemptCheckpointRemoval(memToClear) == 0);
    }
#endif

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:103, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Feel free to remove the dev assert if it will simplify things.
