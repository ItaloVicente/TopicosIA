DESCRIPTION:

VBucketFilter::split should not create empty filter objects

Because an empty VBucketFilter matches everything, which doesn't make
much sense if the aim is to create N non-overlapping subsets from a set
of M vBuckets.

Also removed some unused methods which were broken in similar ways.

Line:442, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> Looks suspicious - should this be:

 partFilters.size() - concurrentVisitors
 
?
