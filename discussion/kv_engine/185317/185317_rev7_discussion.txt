DESCRIPTION:

VBucketFilter::split should not create empty filter objects

Because an empty VBucketFilter matches everything, which doesn't make
much sense if the aim is to create N non-overlapping subsets from a set
of M vBuckets.

Also removed some unused methods which were broken in similar ways and
moved the tests to a more appropriate location.
