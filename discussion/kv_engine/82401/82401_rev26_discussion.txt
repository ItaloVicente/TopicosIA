DESCRIPTION:

MB-25427 [1/4] Move GET_META to memcached - New functions in engines.

GET_META command is currently implemented in engines (ep, default,
 ewouldblock) under `unknown_command()`. Memcached does not know
about GET_META, thus the MCBP request/response decoding/encoding
are delegated to the engines.
With this change we want to move all MCBP processing to memcached
and make the engines to peform only the bucket operations (i.e.,
retrieving the item metadata from memory or disk).
This first patch adds the new `get_meta()` functions into engines
and updates the engine testsuites to use the new API.
For now we do not switch the execution to the new implementation,
we will switch in a following patch.

Line:573, engines/default_engine/default_engine.cc -> Could also just use "handle"

Line:581, engines/default_engine/default_engine.cc -> use handle

Line:353, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> we need to make sure that this returns a value which is consistent across the various engines. We do have a "special hack" for this in the case for virtuall xattrs for subdoc as we didn't want to change the normal return value from get_item_info (as it was only used _once_).

I guess the "cleanest" solution is to make it consistent what the exptime in item_info is, so that we need to do the "fixup" in the implementation in GetMetaContext just like we do for the exptime in vattr.

Line:573, engines/default_engine/default_engine.cc -> Done

Line:581, engines/default_engine/default_engine.cc -> Done

Line:353, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> I had a look and it seems that changing the type of `info_item.exptime` to `time_t` does not require many changes around. 
Do we want to put it within thin this change or in a separate patch?

Line:353, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> Also, it is not clear to me what kind of `exptime` default-engine and ep-engine are supposed to return, absolute or relative ? Whatever it is, is not it already "consistent" across engines ?

Line:353, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> Pretty sure that on the wire it needs to be absolute.

Line:353, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> If you look in the comment for item_info it states:

    rel_time_t exptime; /**< When the item will expire (relative to process
                         * startup) */

from history memcached buckets always stored the time in relative time (as it would be gone if the server restarted or the item evicted), but in ep-buckets it was stored in absolute time since it may be read back in from disk. 

We never actually read the data in the core after calling get_item_info on the item (as it was internal to the engine), but the first time we tried to use it was when we added the virtual xattrs in subdoc. 

Given that we call this method a lot of times around in our code, and in 99.999% of the times we don't care about the exptime we don't want to always translate it back to relative time and throw away the result.

I linked to the subdoc code in one of the other patch where we call the function to "translate" it to an absolute time. I personally think it would be best if we continue to return the absolute time for the expiry time from this method _AND_ call the same translation function as we do for the subdoc code where we use the information from item_info (that way we're consistent across the usage of the struct)
