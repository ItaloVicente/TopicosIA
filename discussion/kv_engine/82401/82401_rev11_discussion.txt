DESCRIPTION:

MB-25427 [1/n] Move GET_META to memcached - Add new `get_meta()` into engines.

GET_META command is currently implemented in engines (ep, default,
 ewouldblock) under `unknown_command()`. Memcached does not know
about GET_META, thus the MCBP request/response decoding/encoding
are delegated to the engines.
With this change we want to move all MCBP processing to memcached
and make the engines to peform only the bucket operations (i.e.,
retrieving the item metadata from memory or disk).
This first patch adds the new `get_meta()` functions into engines.
For now we do not switch the execution to the new implementation,
we will switch in a following patch.

(tip.. use git clang-format to reformat the code correctly before committing).
Line:86, engines/default_engine/default_engine.cc -> these should be aligned under ENGINE_HANDLE

Line:562, engines/default_engine/default_engine.cc -> Ditto

Now that everything is in the same git repo, why do we want to split up the commit into multiple pieces rather than have a single commit which introduce the API and contain all of the rewritten unit tests so that we know that the API works as expected?)

This was my suggestion - to keep the change in manageable, easy-to-review sizes. I expect the whole thing will be north of 500 lines which is a chunky change for humans to review accurately.

Then we need to wait to approve and merge this one until we know that the API is usable as we don't have a single user of it, and no tests.

This patch should at least include support for the new API call in engine testapp.
