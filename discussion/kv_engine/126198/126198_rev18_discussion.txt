DESCRIPTION:

MB-39505: Introduce StatCollector interface

StatCollector is an interface which may be implemented by statistics
backends. This is done in preparation for exposing stats to Prometheus.

The existing stat formatting logic has been encapsulated in
CBStatCollector. The add_casted_stat interface has been maintained, and
simply calls into CBStatCollector.

Currently, no stats-adding code directly use the StatCollector
interface. For now, add_casted_stat remains as a stub which internally
uses CBStatCollector. With this, stat groups can be migrated one at a
time.
