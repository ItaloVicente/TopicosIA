DESCRIPTION:

MB-30524: Add collections support to stats key and vkey

Add collections support to stats key and vkey. Do do this refactor
doKeyStats() and doVKeyStats() of EventuallyPersistentEngine to ensure
that a key/vkey stats request checks for a vbucket-id rather than
defaulting to vbucket-id 0. Also expand stats key/vkey to allow the
specification of a collection in the following formats.

key stats:
  key the-key vbid collection-path e.g. key mykey 0 _default._default
  key-byid the-key vbid collection-path e.g. key-byid mykey 0 0x0
vkey stats:
  vkey the-key vbid collection-path e.g. key mykey 0 _default._default
  vkey-byid the-key vbid collection-path e.g. key-byid mykey 0 0x0

Also update cbstats.py to be able to take advantage of these new
collection interfaces.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit

Line:498, engines/ep/management/cbstats -> Nit, it's common to do

 return False, args[0]

which returns an (immutable) tuple rather than a list

Line:499, engines/ep/management/cbstats -> does the case where len(args) == 0 need to be handled prior to this? Or would that not reach this point?

Line:508, engines/ep/management/cbstats -> nit 

 "{:#x}".format(cid)

will add the "0x" prefix itself

(yeah I know I didn't use that in the collection stats but shhhhhh)

Line:540, engines/ep/management/cbstats -> might be more pythonic to start with

 vbs = None

and make the later if

 if vbs is not None:

- unless the result of mc.stats(cmd) can be an empty dict, in which case the current if is fine


Equally, all of the except cases exit, so vbs doesn't need to be initialised here, we'd never reach 558 with a vbs that hasn't been assigned.

Line:57, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Huh - clang format include ordering is case sensitive? Good to know!

Line:4484, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Is this safe? A string_view isn't null terminated, so constructing a std::string implicitly (to pass to stoi) here from .data() will read "past the end" of the string_view.

Might be better to do

 std::stoi(std::string(collectionStr.substr(2)), ...

Is the +2 to skip a 0x prefix? If it is, std::stoi skips the prefix for you

Line:4503, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Doesn't

 Collections::Manager::getCollectionID

return a scope and cid in one go? (or an unknown_scope/unknown_collection error and a manifest uid)

Line:4517, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Is this the same as boost::algorithm::split ?

boost also has an is_space() predicate that might be more efficient than is_any_of(" ") (I have no idea if it is)

Line:4521, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> nit - should this use .at()?

Line:4526, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> .at() here also? Though, might need to check earlier that there are that many elements, otherwise .at() here could throw again

Line:4764, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Hmmm, this made me wonder - looking at the current cb_isPrefix implementation, the key.size() > X checks look to be unnecessary now, but I wonder if they are holdovers from an older impl.

e.g.,

 cb_isPrefix("s"s, "str"s)
 cb_isPrefix(""s, "str"s)

are both false, and "safe" as .compare() is used underneath

No need to change - that's how it was before, and this is basically tangential to the patch, just thought I'd mention is as it came to mind 😊

Line:508, engines/ep/management/cbstats -> Though tbh manual 0x does avoid some magic, and makes it clearer at a glance what it will do

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:498, engines/ep/management/cbstats -> thanks for the tip

Line:499, engines/ep/management/cbstats -> Done

Line:508, engines/ep/management/cbstats -> Done

Line:57, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Might be a slip-up from me will sort it out
Update: Yes indeed clang-format is case sensitive

Line:4484, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> the +2 is for 0x so will change

Line:4503, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Errr do we need to do that? We know the collection ID is valid by the fact we get a scope otherwise we'll receive unknown_scope/unknown_collection?
Plus we don't have a getCollectionID() that takes a cid. getCollectionID(std::string_view path).

Line:4517, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> I believe boost::algorithm::split is the same as boost::split.
is_space() probs a little better as it does not need to create a list

Line:4521, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> garded

Line:4526, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> garded

Line:4764, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Done
