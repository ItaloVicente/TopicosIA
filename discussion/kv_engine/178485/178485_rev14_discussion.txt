DESCRIPTION:

MB-53100: Don't register checkpoint cursors in meta only checkpoints

Problem:
In MB-53100 it was observed that the ActiveStream::curChkSeqno throws
due to its value becoming non weakly monotonic, while it's processing
times from the checkpoint manager. Just after vbucket became active due
to a takeover stream.

Cause:
The reason for this is due an issue in how we register cursors when the
checkpoint manager contains an checkpoint that only contains meta items
(though this can happen with checkpoints that do have non-meta items
in). A meta only checkpoint can occur during a takeover stream, as the
initial active node sends a snapshot with just one meta item which is a
setVbucketState to pending.

Example:
id:2 [ e:5, cs:5, vbs:5, ce:5]
id:3 [ e:5, cs:5, m:5, m:6 )

Using the example above. The meta only checkpoint is problematic for
CheckpointManager::registerCursorBySeqno() as it will walk through the
meta checkpoint trying to find the seqno 5 requested for. However, if
the requested seqno 5 was the same seqno as setVbucketState(e.g. vbs:5),
we would end up walking though the checkpoint without ever finding an
item with a seqno greater than 5. Thus, getting to the
checkpoint_end (ce:5) item, who's seqno is 5. We would then return the
registration seqno as 5 + 1 = 6. This would then set the value of
ActiveStream::curChkSeqno to 6 from 5.

When the active stream wants to process items using the cursor it will
then receive the items from the point where the cursor currently sits,
including the vbucket item but also importantly it will see a non-meta
item with seqno X. This then caused curChkSeqno to from 6 to 5
which a violation and thus we throw.

Fix:
When walking though the checkpoint to find the right item to register
the cursor against, we need to ensure the item is not a meta item. If it
is then we should just continue to the next item. If we don't find a
non-meta item in the checkpoint for the seqno, then we should continue
to the next checkpoint.

In the situation we reach the end of the open checkpoint we need to
register at the end of the checkpoint. This means we need to predict
what the next item's seqno will be. Thus, if the last item isn't a meta
item then we will set the 'result.seqno' to the end item's bySeqno + 1.
If it is a meta item then it will just be set to bySeqno. As the meta
items's seqno hasn't been made visible.
