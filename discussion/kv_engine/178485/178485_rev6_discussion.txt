DESCRIPTION:

MB-53100: Don't register checkpoint cursors in meta only checkpoints

Problem:
In MB-53100 it was observed that the ActiveStream::curChkSeqno throws
due to a it's value becoming non weakly monotonic, while it's processing
times from the checkpoint manager. Just after vbucket became active due
to a takeover stream.

Cause:
The reason for this is due an issue in how we register cursors when the
checkpoint manager contains an checkpoint that only contains meta items.
A meta only checkpoint can occur during a takeover stream, as the
initial active node sens a snapshot with just one meta item which is a
setVbucketState to pending.

This meta only checkpoint is problematic for
CheckpointManager::registerCursorBySeqno() as it will walk thought the
meta checkpoint trying to find the seqno X requested for. However, if
the requested seqno X was the same seqno as setVbucketState, we would
end up talking though the checkpoint ever finding an item with a seqno
greater than X. Thus, getting to the checkpoint_end item, who's seqno is
X. We would then return the registration seqno as X + 1. This would then
set the value of ActiveStream::curChkSeqno to X + 1 from X.

When the active stream wants to process items using the cursor it will
then receive the items from the point where the cursor currently sits,
including the vbucket item but also importantly it will see a non-meta
item with seqno X. This then caused curChkSeqno to from (X + 1) to X
which a violation and thus we throw.

Fix:
Before we walk though a checkpoint trying to find the right place to put
the cursor we should consider if the next checkpoint might contain the
non-meta item with the seqno looking for. We can do this by checking if
the min cursor seqno of the next checkpoint is the same as the one we're
looking for. If so, then we should just skip to the next checkpoint.

Also in the situation we reach the end of the open checkpoint we need to
register at the end of the checkpoint. This means we need to predict
what the next item's seqno will be. Thus, if the last item isn't a meta
item then we will set the 'result.seqno' to the end item's bySeqno + 1.
If it is a meta item then it will just be set to bySeqno. As the meta
items's seqno hasn't been made visible.

due to its

Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit walking

Line:398, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Hmmm - feels like lastBySeqno+1 might simplify this, as that's the next seqno a real item would be assigned

Line:3345, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Mmmm feels a little implicit to rely on this here vs an explicit check.

On that note - won't this use the default policy, so wouldn't throw if dev asserts are off?

Fine in CV (IIRC they're always on now?), but possibly misleading locally - could specify throw policy to clarify
