DESCRIPTION:

MB-53100: Don't register checkpoint cursors in meta only checkpoints

Problem:
In MB-53100 it was observed that the ActiveStream::curChkSeqno throws
due to its value becoming non weakly monotonic, while it's processing
times from the checkpoint manager. Just after vbucket became active due
to a takeover stream.

Cause:
The reason for this is due an issue in how we register cursors when the
checkpoint manager contains an checkpoint that only contains meta items.
A meta only checkpoint can occur during a takeover stream, as the
initial active node sens a snapshot with just one meta item which is a
setVbucketState to pending.

This meta only checkpoint is problematic for
CheckpointManager::registerCursorBySeqno() as it will walk thought the
meta checkpoint trying to find the seqno X requested for. However, if
the requested seqno X was the same seqno as setVbucketState, we would
end up walking though the checkpoint without ever finding an item with
a seqno greater than X. Thus, getting to the checkpoint_end item,
who's seqno is X. We would then return the registration seqno as X + 1.
This would then set the value of ActiveStream::curChkSeqno to X + 1
from X.

When the active stream wants to process items using the cursor it will
then receive the items from the point where the cursor currently sits,
including the vbucket item but also importantly it will see a non-meta
item with seqno X. This then caused curChkSeqno to from (X + 1) to X
which a violation and thus we throw.

Fix:
Before we walk though a checkpoint trying to find the right place to put
the cursor we should consider if the next checkpoint might contain the
non-meta item with the seqno looking for. We can do this by checking if
the min cursor seqno of the next checkpoint is the same as the one we're
looking for. If so, then we should just skip to the next checkpoint.

Also in the situation we reach the end of the open checkpoint we need to
register at the end of the checkpoint. This means we need to predict
what the next item's seqno will be. Thus, if the last item isn't a meta
item then we will set the 'result.seqno' to the end item's bySeqno + 1.
If it is a meta item then it will just be set to bySeqno. As the meta
items's seqno hasn't been made visible.

Line:30, /COMMIT_MSG -> It might be helpful to include a diagram of the problematic Checkpoint / cursor layout here to aid the reader in following along.

Line:40, /COMMIT_MSG -> This feels overly complex / costly - we shouldn't need to "peek" ahead in the Checkpoint list to find where to register something.

It feels like sequence numbering is broken here - from what you describe; an _earlier_ checkpoint has an item with higher seqno (for a meta item?) than a later checkpoint. If that's the case, we need to fix that.

Line:358, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Hmmmmm - having rechecked Checkpoint::getHighSeqno() I'm a little puzzled.

If `en` is the seqno of the last non-meta item (or of the ckpt start, or 0), then a stream request for seqno X where X is also the seqno of a set vbstate at the end of a checkpoint, that shouldn't actually enter the

 } else if (startBySeqno <= en) {

case because en = Checkpoint::getHighSeqno() would be `X-1` as it walks backwards to a non-meta item.

e.g.,

Checkpoint
[mutation 1, .... mutation 99, setvbstate 100]

checkpoint.getHighSeqno() == 99

stream request for 100 should not try to register a cursor in that checkpoint at all?

In which case, it shouldn't need special handling, won't the loop just advance to the next checkpoint as normal?


Caveat: part way through first coffee so I might be having a "duh" moment, but wanted to check anyway :P

Line:40, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's not really that costly to peak given we're just calling std::next() and checking the min seqno of the next checkpoint which is an O(1) method.

Regarding the seqno value, it's not greater seqno value its equal.


id:2 [ e:5, cs:5, vbs:5, ce:5]
id:3 [ e:5, cs:5, m:5, m:6 )

Using the example above, if we had a stream request from seqno:5 we would currently place our cursor at vbs:5 and tell the ActiveStream that the next seqno is seqno:6. However, when we went to process items we would end up process the mutation at seqno:5. Causing us to observer seqnos out of order, as the stream shouldn't observe seqno:5 as it's request everything from then (not including). 

So instead we need to register the cursor at m:5, so that the next item is m:6.

Line:358, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Um so that's not the case I'm trying to cover here, though it does raise an interesting point that I might be able to look into. The issue is when there's a meta only checkpoint that's been closed. See the example in this comment (https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/178485/7//COMMIT_MSG#40).

Line:40, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ok, that makes more sense, thanks.

Given meta items mean we can have more than one item with the same seqno, I think what we want to do is ignore meta-items when selecting where to register a cursor.

So in this example we should ignore vbs:5, ce:5 from checkpoint 2, and then also ignore e:5, and cs:5 from checkpoint 3; placing the cursor on m:5. We shouldn't need a "lookahead" for this, we just keep iterating as per the current logic.


(In terms of "costly / complex" - it's more the latter - checkpoint management is confusing enough, having special cases where we lookahead complicates the logic.)
