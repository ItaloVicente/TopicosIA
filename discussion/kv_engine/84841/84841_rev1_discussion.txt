DESCRIPTION:

MB-25344: [10/n] Logically deleted keys and getMetaData

GetMetaData must ignore keys in deleted collections even if they may
hang around in the HT for some time. If collection deletion was
synchronous, then we would never be able to query a key in a deleted
collection, hence it's cleaner to say this key is gone rather than
return its meta.
