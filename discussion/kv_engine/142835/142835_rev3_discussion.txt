DESCRIPTION:

Make sure that we don't leave a partial compacted file behind

Refactor the compaction code to make sure that we always delete
the temporary file used by compaction if compaction fails.

A new MB would be fine. I'm asking because for MB-43403 I've been trying to find the concurrent flushing + compaction changes to work out the test coverage and being able to use Jira search helps.

I don't see the benefit of creating a bug report (other than just extra work for me) just to simplify the code to ensure that there isn't any failure paths where we could leave a temporary file.
