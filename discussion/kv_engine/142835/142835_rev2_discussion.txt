Make sure that we don't leave a partial compacted file behind

the temporary file used by compaction if compaction fails.

Should probably be comitted under some MB. Perhaps MB-43121?
Line:1072, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> should perhaps expand this comment to include removal of the compact file

Line:712, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> typo

That MB is tracking something else. In that MB we received delete vbucket while compacting was running so the vbucket file got removed as part of the del vbucket command. Then at a later time compaciton completes and renames the file to the new vbucket name. Then it "fails" to unlink the old one as that already exists.
Line:1072, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> We don't really need to hold the lock when removing the file in case of failures?

Line:712, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Done

Line:1072, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Can we move it above the lock then?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1072, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> The reason I put it down there was because of that's where we handle the error situation instead of creating another if (!result). We could alternatively _ALWAYS_ call removeCompactFile as that will try to stat the file first and only try to remove something if the file exists (but that adds an extra io operation for the common path (success).
