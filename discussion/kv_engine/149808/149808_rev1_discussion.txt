Reviewed up to end of daemon/protocol/
Line:5, auditd/generator/CMakeLists.txt -> Similary here.

Line:6, auditd/generator/auditevent_generator.h -> Nit: the current wrapping of these notices (with C++ block comment prefix) puts them over 80 columns in a few places. For consistency with the rest of KV-Engine code can you fix to not exceed 80 columns please?

Line:2, daemon/cmdline.cc -> Could you describe how we are determining the copyright date for files like this which lack a header previously?

Similary, how the files which _do_ have a copyright date don't necessary list the date the file was created by Couchbase - we've made ad-hoc updates to copyright date when files have been modified.

Line:1, CTestCustom.cmake -> Hey Trond does the start date look correct for this one?

Line:1, auditd/generator/CMakeLists.txt -> I think it should be 2018 - as all the files it contain have a 2018 copyright.

Line:1, auditd/tests/CMakeLists.txt -> Think it should be 2016 - as that the oldest copyright for the files in this directory.

Line:2, cbcrypto/cbcrypto_test.cc -> cbcrypto.cc has a copyright of 2016.  So seems strange the test file as a date of 2015.

Line:1, cbsasl/CMakeLists.txt -> We have files in this directory dating back to 2013 e.g. server.cc, therefore not sure whether this file should also be 2013

Line:1, cluster_framework/CMakeLists.txt -> some files in the directory have a copyright date of 2019 - therefore not sure whether this should also have a 2019 start?

Line:1, daemon/CMakeLists.txt -> need to check that should not be 2013

Line:1, daemon/cmdline.cc -> Not sure when date orginated - Trond is it correct?

Line:4, daemon/cmdline.h -> not sure where the date originated - Trond is it correct?

Line:4, daemon/mc_time.cc -> not sure of date - or whether we should have a a licence - Trond?

Line:2, daemon/mc_time.h -> Note sure where the date originated - also whether we should have a licence - Trond?

Line:2, daemon/memcached.h -> not sure of the date - or whether it should have a licence - Trond?

Line:4, daemon/stdin_check.cc -> Trond does the copyright date look correct?

Line:4, daemon/thread.cc -> Trond does this date look correct?

Line:1, engines/CMakeLists.txt -> Trond does this date look correct?

Line:1, engines/crash_engine/CMakeLists.txt -> Trond does this date look correct?

Line:1, engines/default_engine/CMakeLists.txt -> and another...

Line:4, engines/default_engine/assoc.cc -> Trond another date check?

Line:1, engines/default_engine/assoc.h -> Trond another date check?

Line:4, engines/default_engine/default_engine.cc -> and another date check

Line:2, engines/default_engine/default_engine_internal.h -> another date check

Reviewed all files.
Those that have not got a previous copyright - but looks like it can be added, I've added a check date label.  As I'm not sure how the dates were calculated.

Did highlight the following should not be copyrighted.

Line:1, auditd/generator/CMakeLists.txt -> This date came from the first appearance of the file in the repository (http://review.couchbase.org/c/memcached/+/52916/)

If 2018 is more appropriate it's no problem to change.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2, daemon/cmdline.cc -> When injecting a header, we use the year from the output of:

git log --pretty=format:"%as" -- [filename] | tail -n 1

When an existing Couchbase copyright line with a year is present, we stick with that.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2, daemon/cmdline.cc -> If there is an existing copyright year, that should be the number which is used. The date the file was added to git should only be used where no year is present.

If you see dates actually changing from one year to another please point me  at the files in question and I'll look into why it's happening.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2, daemon/cmdline.cc -> So given we've been updating (on an ad-hoc basis) the copyright when files are modified; if we are actually aiming to have the copyright range in the new licence be accurate we probably should take the lower of the one from git and the existing Couchbase copyright year.
