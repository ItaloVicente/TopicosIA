Line:260, docs/CodingStandards.rst -> What's the process for new files? I assume we should start with the current date as when the file is created - as such should this template be modified?

File Comment: engines/default_engine/assoc.h -> "default" engine is basically the original memcache bucket type; the code in this directory mostly pre-dates Couchbase's (or even northscale's) creation. I don't think we should claim blanket copyright on this; plus the memcache bucket type is on the way out so these files will probably be deleted in a release or so.

File Comment: auditd/CMakeLists.txt -> I don't think there's much value in adding copyright to CMakeLists.txt files; given they aren't actually "source code" and adds a lot of noise for such small files.

I spoke to DaveF and he's happy to not add copyright headers to CMakeLists.txt files - can we exclude them all?

General comment here: as confirmed in a meeting today with Dave F and PM, Legal's opinion on the date in copyright notices is "don't care". We could probably drop it entirely, but if it's there, it should have an open-ended date range, which we have by saying "XXXX-Present". The actual value of XXXX is essentially meaningless legally so long as it is at least in the past.

If there are any files here for which we claim a start copyright date that is older than the file itself, then maaaaaybe it's worth fixing that. In any other case, literally any other year that isn't later than 2021 is totally fine and, for all intents and purposes, legally equivalent. So let's not take a bunch of time tweaking dates.

Would it be possible to split this patch in two where we have one patch containing all the files where we replaced an existing Membase/NorthScale/Couchbase header, and a second patch for the rest of the files? Its pretty hard to navigate in a such a huge patch....

(just did a quick scan for some files)
Line:12, daemon/mc_time.cc -> I don't think we can claim copyright on this file

Line:11, daemon/memcached.h -> we should not claim copyright on this file

Line:11, daemon/thread.cc -> we can't claim this file

File Comment: engines/default_engine/assoc.h -> THat is correct 99% of the files here we can't claim

Let's not claim copyright for any of the files in engines/default_engine.
(Including removing any existing Couchbase copyright files)
