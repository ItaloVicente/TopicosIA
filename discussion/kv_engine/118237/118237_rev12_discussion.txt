DESCRIPTION:

MB-36948: End non-sync write backfills on a visible item

Some DCP consumers need to receive the last item in a snapshot to
confirm that it is complete (e.g., indexer).

If these consumers are not sync write aware, they will not be sent
prepares or aborts (and commits will be replaced with mutations).

If such a consumer receives a snapshot from disk which ends on the
seqno of a prepare or abort, it will *not* receive the last item.
(Snapshots from memory do not encounter this issue, prepares and aborts
are filtered out before determining the snap start and end).

To resolve this, adjust the disk snapshot end to the most recent
committed item available from disk.

There are also edge cases where the entire backfill range may not
contain any items.

Line:1564, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> As per other comment, why don't we do this change in a dedicated patch?


Some consideration though.
The original comment above this code (in AS::scheduleBackfill_UNLOCKED) states that we execute this code only after cursor-dropped.
I'm not sure if that is true, here we could put an Expects(!cursor.lock()).

Line:175, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> A bit misleading, it is the seqno of the last completed Prepare

Line:186, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> nit: not documented above

Line:294, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> It seems that this part is dealing specifically with cursor-dropping.
We could address that in a dedicated patch and do here only the minimal change for "send MVS at markDiskSnapshot"
