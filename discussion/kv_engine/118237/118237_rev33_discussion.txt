DESCRIPTION:

MB-36948: End non-sync write backfills on a visible item

Some DCP consumers need to receive the last item in a snapshot to
confirm that it is complete (e.g., indexer).

If these consumers are not sync write aware, they will not be sent
prepares or aborts (and commits will be replaced with mutations).

If such a consumer receives a snapshot from disk which ends on the
seqno of a prepare or abort, it will *not* receive the last item.
(Snapshots from memory do not encounter this issue, prepares and aborts
are filtered out before determining the snap start and end).

To resolve this, adjust the disk snapshot end to the most recent
committed item available from disk.

There are also edge cases where the entire backfill range may not
contain any items.

Lots of TODOs need addressing!
Line:264, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> what's the plan for this and the following TODO on line 307?

Line:1537, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> same

Line:256, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> If the markDiskSnapshot used the maxVisibleSeqno this value would be misleading and may never reach 0?  The issue i'm thinking about is users/support looking at the UI for GSI/XDCR etc.. and wondering why backfill remaining is not 0

Could we set the correct value if markDiskSnapshot informed us of the end it used?

Line:175, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> need a plan for this

Line:177, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> indent

Line:4490, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> can we add expects for items remaining?

Line:4555, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> can this and the others not be enabled? ephemeral patch proceeds yours

Line:256, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> Ok, looks like we only put the value in takeover stats, so less of an issue for the use-case I had in mind. The real takeover streams should have sync-repl enabled so this could be ok, but we should add comments if it cant easily be fixed

Line:264, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Going to either go for it and flip them in a followup patch, or (more likely) raise a followup MB - should probably do that now so I can tag the TODO with it

Line:256, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> Once the backfill completes it can (or possibly already does) set it to zero and I'm not aware of a tractable way of determining the correct value for this ahead of time. We know how many prepares/aborts are on disk _as a whole_, but for an arbitrary range of seqnos X->Y I was under the impression that a full scan of that range would be needed.

Will comment with caveats

Line:175, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> Slight buck-passing, I just moved the comment :badpokerface:.

Kinda relates to the other case - if we can safely caveat that this value is allowed to overestimate (but not underestimate) then this might be acceptable as-is (with appropriate commenting).

Line:177, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> *shakes fist at self for not running git clang-format for reasons unknown*

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:175, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> oh yes, i see it being moved :D
