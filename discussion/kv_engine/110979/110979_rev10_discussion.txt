DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add support for synchronous compaction for magma

Compaction in magma is asynchronous. Its triggered by 4 conditions:
* Level compaction
* Expiry compaction
  In magma, a histogram of when items will expire is maintained.
  Periodically, magma will trigger a compaction to visit those
  sstables which have expired items to have them removed.
* Dropped collections removal
* Tests
  For tests which call compactDB, we will support synchronous
  compaction.

For DP, will will support level compaction and synchronous
compaction.

The StorageProperties::ConcurrentWriteCompact is set to No. This is a
bit misleading in that magma does support concurrent compaction and
writes, it just doesn't support the ability to update the datastore
from a thread other than the bg_flusher thread. This will be
addressed when the compaction_ctx callback is implemented.

Line:495, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> this member appears to only ever be read/written by the operator(), can it not just be a local variable of the operator() function? Same for kvHandle below, i can only see it read/written in the operator()

Line:499, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> nit: nDeletes is coding standard

Line:500, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> doesn't follow coding standards for naming variables

Also should be const bool

Line:501, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> as above, coding standards issue

Line:590, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> should do in the initialiser list

   compaction_ctxList(configuration.getMaxVBuckets())

Line:2042, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> do the assignment in construction (define a constructor which takes a ctx and kvHandle), it's prone to future issues to expect developers to update the members post construction

Line:2046, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> continue the above comment, if you have a constructor to create the MagmaCompactionCtx line you can just make_unique in one go, no need to make and move

Line:495, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> I believe there may be some misunderstanding on what is happening in compaction. I'd first refer you to the long comment in magma-kvstore.h in regards to compactDB(). For explicit compactions, the compact_ctx & kvHandle are first encountered in compactDB and held throughout the compaction. For implicit compactions which are triggered by magma, we need to get the kvHandle in the callback function (see line 412 above) and we need to make a callback to kv engine (TBD) to get the compaction ctx.

Line:500, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Sure.
FYI... this is similar to what couchstore does.

Line:501, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:590, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:2042, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:500, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> couchstore came before the coding standards
