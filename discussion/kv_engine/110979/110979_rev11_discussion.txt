DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add support for synchronous compaction for magma

Compaction in magma is asynchronous. Its triggered by 4 conditions:
* Level compaction
* Expiry compaction
  In magma, a histogram of when items will expire is maintained.
  Periodically, magma will trigger a compaction to visit those
  sstables which have expired items to have them removed.
* Dropped collections removal
* Tests
  For tests which call compactDB, we will support synchronous
  compaction.

For DP, will will support level compaction and synchronous
compaction.

The StorageProperties::ConcurrentWriteCompact is set to No. This is a
bit misleading in that magma does support concurrent compaction and
writes, it just doesn't support the ability to update the datastore
from a thread other than the bg_flusher thread. This will be
addressed when the compaction_ctx callback is implemented.

Patch Set 11: Code-Review-1

Line:400, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Thanks for the response on earlier comment, I can see what is happening now, this class needs simplifying so that the functionality is a member of MagmaKVStore then all this callback does is (assume this code is now called MagmaKVStore::compactionCallBack(Slice&, Slice&, Slice&)

    bool operator()(const Slice& keySlice,
                    const Slice& metaSlice,
                    const Slice& valueSlice) {
      return magmaKVStore->compactionCallBack(keySlice, metaSlice, valueSlice); 
     }

That way this code doesn't have to poke around inside the MagmaKVStore through the pointer (which needs changing to be a reference as it should never be null)

You then remove the code which is caching a ctx/kvFileHandle as you can just access the compaction_ctxList directly (and the mutex).

Line:496, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Change to a reference

Line:499, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Note you never update this, only read it

Line:590, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Previous review response said the prior comment had been addressed, this should be initialised in the initialiser list.

  compact_ctxList(configuration.getMaxVBuckets())

Line:400, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> While I made the change as you suggested, I honestly don't see where this change makes the code easier to read or performs better. We've traded a few magmaKVStore references for a bunch of cbCtx references which IMO makes the code more difficult to read.

Line:496, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:499, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> This is for items dropped because of dropped collections. Will be used when collection support is added. I leave it as a reminder of work left to be done otherwise I might forget it.

Line:590, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Could you explain the reasoning behind this request? Would't it make more sense to keep common code next to each other rather than separate it? The request you make does not improve performance or make the code easier to read. In fact, I'd argue it makes it more difficult because when looking at the code one has to look at multiple places in the code to see how its allocated and initialized. More explanation please.

Line:590, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Note: that this could also be considered a minor performance problem as you have already constructed an empty vector, because that's what the default behaviour is when you don't explicitly construct in the initialiser list. Then here you construct a new vector of 1024 elements and copy (i think it will use move tho) assign it into the empty one. If you construct the vector in the initialiser list then the vector is constructed once in the correct size with no later copy assignment required. My bigger concern here though is the prevention of subtle bugs

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:400, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> I think it does look better and the ownership is much clearer, rather than a context trying to manipulate the kvstore, the kvstore operates on the context.  The final code could be made tidier if you wished by making a local reference to the cbCtx,ctx, and accessing that, I'll add an example in the new code but I don't think it's required, your choice if you do rebase/make changes.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:499, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> It really should be moved to the patch the adds and uses it otherwise someone who is not involved in this conversation may have to provide support to a version of the code where it exists, is read but never written, which is just confusing. 

I'm not suggesting that's an outcome I expect for this specific patch, but just good practice in general.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:590, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> The request is not a performance problem, it relates to good practice in c++ (prevention of weird bugs). We follow the core guidelines where possible and it's explained in there.
