DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add support for synchronous compaction for magma

Compaction in magma is asynchronous. Its triggered by 4 conditions:
* Level compaction
* Expiry compaction
  In magma, a histogram of when items will expire is maintained.
  Periodically, magma will trigger a compaction to visit those
  sstables which have expired items to have them removed.
* Dropped collections removal
* Tests
  For tests which call compactDB, we will support synchronous
  compaction.

For DP, will will support level compaction and synchronous
compaction.

The StorageProperties::ConcurrentWriteCompact is set to No. This is a
bit misleading in that magma does support concurrent compaction and
writes, it just doesn't support the ability to update the datastore
from a thread other than the bg_flusher thread. This will be
addressed when the compaction_ctx callback is implemented.

Line:374, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> As per conversation on prior patch, remove the nDeletes variable and just but a comment here

    // @todo: Need to add collection dropped items support

Line:413, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> as per earlier comment, you could on line 414 do auto& ctx = *cbCtx.ctx; and operate on the ctx reference throughout the function, that would remove the regular pattern of cbCbtx.ctx-> and you just have ctx.max_purged_seq etc...

This suggestion is optional
