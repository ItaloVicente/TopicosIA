DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor] Make ItemIface a real class instead of void

With this change the ItemIface is a base class the different
engines may subclass for their own implementation.

default_engine stores all of its internal objects as hash_item
and we don't want to increase the size of all of them with 8 bytes
so instead a new ItemHolder class is introduced which is the one
being used between the core and default-engine.

ep-engine already had an Item class which is used between the
core and the engine (which keeps all items in the cache as
StoredValue objects) so this class just inherit from ItemIface.
