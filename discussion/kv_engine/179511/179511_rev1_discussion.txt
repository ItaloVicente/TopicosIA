DESCRIPTION:

MB-53304: Enforce holding of stateLock in VBucket::queueItem [3/n]

MB-53304 suggests we ensure that the stateLock is held by passing a ref
to it in queueItem (and the call hierarchy of queueItem).

This change will allow the ref passed down to be either a lock on the
individual vbucket state or on all states (`vbSetMutex`).

In a future change I will change function signatures to receive this
ref and eventually pass it down to queueItem.
