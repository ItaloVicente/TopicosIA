DESCRIPTION:

MB-39815: Change durability_timeout_mode to event-driven

Change the default durability_timeout_mode from polling to
event-driven (see "MB-39815: Add event-driven SyncWrite timeout
handling" for details).

This has a significant impact on the idle memcached CPU
utilisation. Measuring the memcached idle CPU for 30 (empty) buckets via top:

We can see that idle CPU drops from ~90% (of 1 CPU core) to 10%.

Examiming the pre-thread details, with the original polling timeout
mode the 7 NonIo threads were each running at ~11% of a core each;
contributing 78% CPU total.

Changing to event-driven reduces each of those threads to <0.7% each;
contributing just 2.9% CPU total.
