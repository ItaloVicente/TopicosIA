DESCRIPTION:

MB-52081: Remove ep_kv_size_for_hashtable stat

Wrongly used for exposing the total allocation in the HashTables,
actually that reports:
 (a) The size of StoredValue object + size of resident keys
 (b) The size of all blobs allocated in the system, regardless of
     whether they are referenced by SVs in the HT or not

(b) is obviusly wrong as that accounts also for blobs already ejected
(and eg still referenced by other struct like checkpoints or DCP
readyQ).

Note that we already have the correct replacement that stat, that's
ep_ht_item_memory. That accounts exaclty the size of StoredValue
objects + keys + blobs referenced by the HashTable. Also, we have the
vb_{state} variants of the same.
