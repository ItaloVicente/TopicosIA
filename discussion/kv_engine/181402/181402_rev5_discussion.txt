DESCRIPTION:

MB-52081: Remove the ep_kv_size_for_hashtable stat

Wrongly used for exposing the total allocation in the HashTables,
actually that reports:
 (a) The size of StoredValue object + size of resident keys
 (b) The size of all blobs allocated in the system, regardless of
     whether they are referenced by SVs in the HT or not

(b) is obviously wrong as that accounts also for blobs already ejected
(and eg still referenced by other struct like checkpoints or DCP
readyQ).

Note that we already have the correct replacement for that stat,
that's ep_ht_item_memory. That accounts exaclty the size of
StoredValue objects + keys + blobs referenced by the HashTable. Also,
we have the vb_{state} variants of the same.

Line:3046, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Is getCurrentSize() still used elsewhere? If not should we remove it?

Line:3046, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> I note those paths are only used if memory tracking is off.

I think this stat is still of value - knowing the total footprint of Blobs and StoredValue is useful, even if it's not accurate to describe HashTable footprint.

I think we just remove the "for_hashtable" suffix then any confusion should be avoided.
