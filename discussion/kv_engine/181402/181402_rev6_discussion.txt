DESCRIPTION:

MB-52081: Rename ep_kv_size_for_hashtable into ep_kv_size

The stat accounts for all items metadata, keys and values allocated in
the system. All value blobs are accounted regardless of whether they
are referenced by HashTables or already ejected.

Note that the existing ep_ht_item_memory accounts exaclty the size of
StoredValue objects + keys + blobs referenced by the HashTable, so we
have already a quantity that tracks the exact mem usage in HTs. Also,
we have the vb_{state} variants of the same.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit - typically formatted

 kv_ep_kv_size_bytes{for="hashtable"}

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> ns_server maps prometheus stats back to their old names for rest api compat, this will need an update in

 ns_server/priv/kv_stats_mappings.txt:203
 
(I guess - I don't know the full process on ns_server's side)
Line:355, statistics/stat_definitions.json -> I'd avoid _kv_ in prometheus metrics, that'll turn into

 kv_ep_kv_size_bytes

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Actually the Prometheus metric being renamed is:

 kv_memory_used_bytes{for="hashtable"}
 
the cbstats one is unchanged, and

 kv_ep_kv_size_bytes{for="hashtable"}

does not exist

and the result of this patch as it stands would be

 kv_ep_kv_size_bytes
 
(no stat specific labels, there'd still be bucket=... and so on)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done. Clarified the above in the commit message.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:355, statistics/stat_definitions.json -> I didn't want to change that in this patch as "kv" is a fairly good name for what this stats represents. Which is, the allocation in the system for all Keys and Values (regardless of the ownership of values).
Do you have a suggestion for a nice/alternative name for it? 😊

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hi @ns_server_dev, I've included you in this review with regard of James' question on kv_stats_mappings.txt.

Do we need to update the stat names and translations there too?

Actually I've verified this change locally and everything seems to work fine without touching anything in kv_stats_mappings.txt - Prometheus exposes the new kv_ep_kv_bytes with no evident issue.
Thanks

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Paolo, yes it seems like we need to update the mapping. James is right.

That mapping is used when we are extracting stats from prometheus, not when we are reporting them. Old stats api should use old stats names, that's why we have that mapping.

"/pools/default/buckets/<bucket>/stats" is one of those API's. Please make sure that old ep_kv_size is reported correctly after your change.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:355, statistics/stat_definitions.json -> Hmmmm - good point. Maybe it's fine as-is; the thought was that when looking for this stat in mortimer/promtimer the reader would have a moment of "why does this size stat have three prefixes including kv twice?", but seen next to other metrics with "kv_ep_..." it shouldn't be too non-obvious that this is prefixes+"kv_size".

Expanding it out to "kv_ep_key_value_size" doesn't seem too verbose, but other than that +1 to keeping it as you have it now.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:355, statistics/stat_definitions.json -> The cbstats key doesn't need to change, but

  kv_ep_key_value_size_bytes
 
for prometheus seems good and is independent of the cbstats name.
