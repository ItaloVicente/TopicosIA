DESCRIPTION:

MB-50609: Avoid lost wakeup of CompactTask when multiple running concurrently

While investigating MB-50389, when concurrent compaction tasks were
set to 2 in ep-engine, it was observed that 2 tasks were not always
running concurrently, even though there were sufficient outstanding
tasks.

Examining the wakeup phase at the end of Compaction (by adding some
additional trace spans), it was observed that the two Compact tasks
both finished around the same time, and attempted to wake up the same
Compact task (for vb:2). The next (single) CompactTask to run was
indeed vb:2. Instead of each finishing CompactTask waking up a new,
different task; they both wake up the same, so we end up only starting
one new task - and the concurrency drops.

The issue is in EPBucket::updateCompactionTasks() which is called at
the end of CompactTask::run(). When searching for a Compact task to
wake, it looks for a task in state TASK_SNOOZED and when found wakes
it. However, it uses the async ExecutorPool::wait() method, which does
not actually immediately wake the task, but just sends a message to
the ExecutorPool to handle at a later time. This is problematic as the
task's state is not updated from SNOOZED to RUNNING until this message
is processed - potentially after compactionTasks is unlocked. As such,
a second (or third...) CompactTask finishing could execute
updateCompactionTasks(), find the same "snoozed" task and attempt to
wake the same one.

The primary fix is to use the synchronous wakeAndWait() method which
as the name suggests blocks until the task has actually been
woken. However, that highlights a bug in
FollyExecutorPool::wakeAndWait(); which does not change a task from
SNOOZED to RUNNING, unlike CB3ExecutorPool. This _that_ bug and all
works correctly.
