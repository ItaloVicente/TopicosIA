DESCRIPTION:

MB-33846: Correct use of NonNegativeCounter for numDeletedItems

Currently this counter uses fetch_add to add the difference between pre
and post values. If this difference is negative, then the value that we
attempt to add underflows (to size_t max - 1) when it is implicitly
converted to call fetch_add. Correct this counter by doing a subratction
if the difference between the pre and post values is negative.

Many counters are broke in this way, they will be fixed in different
patches as they expose a number of other bugs.

Also, fix a bug for ephemeral buckets where the HTTombstonePurger would
attempt to decrement numDeletedItems below 0 when the pre item was a
system event and the post item was passed as a nullptr (i.e. removed
from the hash table).

Line:525, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> This is relatively hot code (called for every modification on the hash table). There's also potentially other cases where we use fetch_add() to modify a signed counter with a negative value.

I think a more robust solution would be to change fetch_add() to have similar logic to fetch_sub() - that ensures that _all_ uses of NonNegativeCounter don't underflow.

Line:525, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Will do, got a patch to do so but need to fix a couple bugs in stat counting first. Changed this patch to just fix a bug with system events
