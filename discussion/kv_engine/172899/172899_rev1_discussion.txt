DESCRIPTION:

Make checkpoint snapStartSeqno const

Make the checkpoint snapStartSeqno const as it should be immutable.
To allow this to happen we've removed the ability of the
CheckpointManager to re-use empty checkpoint. Due to us now sometimes
creating empty checkpoints in some unit test, this patch also make
amendments to multiple tests.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'd actually be tempted to make the title reflect the removal of the re-use optimisation, given that's an actual visible behaviour change.

Possibly even break this into two patches; the first to disable that optimisation (the bulk of the work), then a second which makes snapStartSeqno const.

Line:306, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Might be nicer to just create a new checkpoint for 1001..1003 - avoids modifying the snapshot end (which we might want to remove as a mutator later down the line...)

Line:1043, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Comment needs updating - and maybe explain why we have 2 now.

Line:2247, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Comment needs updating.

Line:2589, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Have you considered making replica VBuckets start without any checkpoints - any relying on a SNAPSHOT_MARKER (CKPT) coming along? That feels like a more idiomatic way of dealing with removing this "optimisation", and would get us back to a single Checkpoint for when we first stream a snapshot from an active? - i.e. I think you would be able to undo virtually all the test changes...

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Seems a sensible suggestion will make the cont change much clearer :).

Line:1043, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Done

Line:2247, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Done

Line:2589, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> I think is current approach is probably going to be the cleanest in the end, I've investigated not creating a checkpoint if we've got not snapshot range on disk. Which I agree at a superficial level is nice, but if we perform a set vbucket_state from replica -> replica (no this is a bit silly of a reason but its an issue as its legal for ns_server or our tests to do this) we need to create a checkpoint to store the meta item in. So we can end up creating two checkpoints any way, and we need to add extra code to checkpoint manager to handle this case. 

Think when we take this into consideration we're making the code more complex to make lazy checkpoint creation on replicas just to try and reduce the number of changes for our tests. Which seems the wrong way to look at things IMO.

Line:2589, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Makes sense - I wasn't sure exactly how the checkpoints end up getting created by ns_server,but as you highlight the multiple SetVBState commands will create extra checkpoints each time.

Line:2589, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Note: The first checkpoint is created at CM::CM() regardless of the vbstate, and the fact that we always have at least 1 open checkpoint is currently an invariant in CM
