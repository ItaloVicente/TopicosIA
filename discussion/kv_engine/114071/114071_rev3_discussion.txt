DESCRIPTION:

Remove Ephemeral DCPBackfillMemory (non-buffered)

Remove the DCPBackfillMemory class, leaving only the
DCPBackfillMemoryBuffered sibling.

During Ephemeral develoment we initially had an in-memory backfill
class (DCPBackfillMemory) which performed backfill "atomically" - lock
the seqList, take a copy all items in the given range, then
unlock. However this resulted in (a) potential slowdown for front-end
ops whils seqlist was locked and (b) large spikes in memory to handle
the large number of items being moved around.

An alternative sibling class - DCPBackfillMemoryBuffered - was added
which makes use of the range read iterator support to allow iteration
over the seqlist; while still allowing concurrent access from the
frontend. This class has been used by default since Ephemeral was
released.

Remove the essentially dead non-buffered variant - we've never had
cause to switch back to it, and it just adds extra maitenance to
keep it.
