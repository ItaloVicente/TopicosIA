DESCRIPTION:

Build speed [3/6]: Move Manifest Handles outside VB::Manifest class

Using ClangBuildAnalyzer highlighted that the header
'collections/vbucket_manifest.h' is overall 2nd most expensive header to
include when building ep-engine_ep_unit_tests (and contributes to the
hottest, vbucket.h).

Overall time to build ep-engine_ep_unit_tests and top 5 expensive
headers:

Before:
      149.27 real      1467.24 user        85.71 sys

    *** Expensive headers:
    173099 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/vbucket.h (included 101 times, avg 1713 ms), included via:
    162213 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h (included 118 times, avg 1374 ms), included via:
     99883 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h (included 67 times, avg 1490 ms), included via:
     93136 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket_iface.h (included 71 times, avg 1311 ms), included via:
     79157 ms: tlm/deps/json.exploded/include/nlohmann/json.hpp (included 137 times, avg 577 ms), included via:

A significant amount of the cost of vbucket_manifest.h is the fact
that the *Handle classes cannot be forward-declared as they are nested
classes inside Manifest. Many instances where vbucket_manifest.h is
included (for example vbucket.h) could be avoided if ReadHandle et al
_could_ be forward-declared. That would signifciantly reduce the
number of times vbucket_manifest.h muct be includes (118 times above).

Move ReadHandle et al into non-nested classes within the
Collections::VB namespace, also moving them into their own header
(vbucket_manifest_handles.h).

This results in the following header include counts / costs:

      151.04 real      1434.77 user        84.63 sys

    *** Expensive headers:
    114877 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/vbucket.h (included 101 times, avg 1137 ms), included via:
     86771 ms: tlm/deps/json.exploded/include/nlohmann/json.hpp (included 137 times, avg 633 ms), included via:
     71218 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h (included 67 times, avg 1062 ms), included via:
     60260 ms: ../kv_engine/include/memcached/dockey.h (included 209 times, avg 288 ms), included via:
     59211 ms: ../kv_engine/include/memcached/engine.h (included 151 times, avg 392 ms), included via:
 ...
7th  57623 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h (included 46 times, avg 1252 ms), included via:

vbucket_manifest.h cost has reduced from 162s to 57s, and number of
include times from 118 to 46.

This in turn has reduced the cost of vbucket.h from 173s to 114s.
