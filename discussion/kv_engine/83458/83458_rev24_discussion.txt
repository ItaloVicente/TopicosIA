DESCRIPTION:

MB-26010 [RocksDB] Correctly call Persistence Callbacks

Persistence Callbacks are currently called just after a mutation is
queued for flushing.
With this change we execute the Callbacks when the mutation is actually
flushed to disk.

I have not found any test in any of the `ep_testsuite` referring directly to Persistence Callbacks. But, some of the statistics tests rely on them as Callbacks update some stats. 

Do we want to implement a test specific to Callbacks? I think that the coverage would be partial, as our Callbacks are not complete (we miss the real `mutation_result` because we do not want call Get on RocksDB only for knowing if the given key `existsOnDB`).

Thanks for looking.

I would suggest creating a relatively simple "RocksDBKVStoreTest (if one doesn't already exist) which simply calls begin(); set(); commit(); and validates that the persistence callback is only called once commit() is called (and not just when set() is called).

You might want to look at GoogleMock for checking the expectations - it's quite useful when you want to verify when certain functions (e.g. callbacks) are invoked.
