DESCRIPTION:

MB-26010 [RocksDB] Correctly call Persistence Callbacks

Persistence Callbacks are currently called just after a mutation is
queued for flushing.
With this change we execute the Callbacks when the mutation is actually
flushed to disk.

Change-Id: Ibf5dbc7e77ca1825686e85c487967baf084d3060

Line:1851, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> I was considering if this should be a KVStore test rather than a RocksDBKVStore only test (it seems we were not testing persistence callbacks at all)..

Line:1860, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Style: Given you're read most of the kvstoreConfig options from Configuration; simpler to just call the KVStoreConfig(Configuration&) constructor; overriding any necessary Configuration options beforehand.

Line:1873, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Note: if you put all this in a scope; then it will ensure that the EXPECT_CALL occurs before the scope ends. At the moment I don't think you're actually checking the function isn't called - does this test fail if you revert your change?

(Essentially GoogleMock only checks expectations have happened when the mock is destructed. You might need to use the `InSequence` class in it's own scope to verify that the callback is not called before the commit() method.

Line:1873, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Reverted the change and the test fails (i.e., EXPEXT_CALL correctly reports a violation).
From GoogleMock documentation:

> EXPECT_CALL() should be read as expecting that a call will occur in the future, not that a call has occurred. Why does Google Mock work like that? Well, specifying the expectation beforehand allows Google Mock to report a violation as soon as it arises, when the context (stack trace, etc) is still available.

So, it seems that violations are checked even before the scope ends.
`InSequence` seems to be more suitable for when we want to check that multiple `EXPECT_CALL` are verified in-sequence, e.g.:

> InSequence _seq;
EXPECT_CALL(obj, func1()).Times(1);
EXPECT_CALL(obj, func2()).Times(1);

In that case, GoogleMock reports a violation if `func2` is called before `func1`, even if the two functions are both called exactly once.

Line:1873, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Thanks for clarifying / offline discussion. As discussed, fine to keep the mock structure as-is; but maybe split into a Set and Del test?
