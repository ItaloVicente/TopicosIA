DESCRIPTION:

MB-26010 [RocksDB] Correctly call Persistence Callbacks

Persistence Callbacks are currently called just after a mutation is
queued for flushing.
With this change we execute the Callbacks when the mutation is actually
flushed to disk.

Change-Id: Ibf5dbc7e77ca1825686e85c487967baf084d3060
