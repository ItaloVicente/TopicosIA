DESCRIPTION:

MB-26010 [RocksDB] Correctly call Persistence Callbacks

Persistence Callbacks are currently called just after a mutation is
queued for flushing.
With this change we execute the Callbacks when the mutation is actually
flushed to disk.

Change-Id: Ibf5dbc7e77ca1825686e85c487967baf084d3060

Partial review - one comment so far.
Line:239, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> We need to check that we aren't already in a transaction.

Line:239, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Ah, you are right, I did not catch what we are doing for Couchstore! In  `begin` for Couchstore we do just this:

        intransaction = true;
        return intransaction;

So, a thread can start a transaction even if `intransaction` is already `true`. And this seems wrong.
