DESCRIPTION:

MB-41092: Track prepares in collection persisted high seqno

A follow-up to the intial fix for MB-41092, if a warmup occurred
before the collection was dropped there was a possibility
that compaction would not be triggered.

1) Simplify Collection::Flush so that it tracks just one seqno
per collection, and that must include prepares.

2) Wire magma through so that it updates the value 1)

3) Update the unit tests to cover the case where a warm-up
occurs.
