DESCRIPTION:

MB-44107: CB3ExecutorPool: always account freed Task to bucket

Identified two bugs in CB3ExecutorPools' memory tracking via test
ExecutorPoolEpEngineTest/0.MemoryTracking_Run intermittently failing
when run with CB3ExecutorPool:

1. CB3ExecutorThread:resetCurrentTask(): If we free a GlobalTask from
   resetCurrentTask, then the memory for the GlobalTask is not
   accounted to the owning bucket.

2. CB3ExecutorPool::cancel(): This does attempt to account memory to
   the current bucket when task is freed, but it currently only does
   this when 'remove' is true. However, that parameter should only
   affect the management of the taskLocator, if the local variable
   `task` ends up as the last owner of the GlobalTask then we need to
   account memory to the bucket regardless.

Fix by switching to the appropriate bucket before freeing.

Note: Both of these cases are already tested via MemoryTracking_Run;
it's just difficult to orchestrate exactly where a Task is freed from
within CB3ExecutorPool.
