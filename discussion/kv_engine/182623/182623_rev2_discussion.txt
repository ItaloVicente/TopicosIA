DESCRIPTION:

[BP] MB-51558: Fix ScheduleCancelx2 intermittent failure

We occasionally see this test fail for the CB3 pool because
registerTaskable() also starts up n workers which are actually
running during this test. This test assumes 0 running workers to
poke the state properly so we should move the setting of NonIO
threads to 0 to after the registerTaskable call.

(cherry picked from commit 538904b50f5635cf0da99e92704121e55e62cb9d)
