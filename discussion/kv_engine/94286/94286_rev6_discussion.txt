DESCRIPTION:

MB-29013: Add temporal behaviour to hifi_mfu eviction policy

The YSCB workload D is a highly temporal workload.  The current
hfi_mfu eviction policy only relies on execution frequency to make
eviction decisions.

We are therefore are introducing a temporal element into the eviction
decision.  The rule is that if an item has an execution frequency of
zero (it means the the frequency has been decremented either by the
decayer task or the paging visitor) then its eviction decision will be
based solely on being below the execution frequency (which it will be)
and if its eligible for eviction.

If an item has an execution counter greater than zero we only evict
if its age is greater than the ageThreshold.

The ageThreshold is generated using an approach similar to the frequency
threshold.  We maintain an ageHistogram, adding to it if the age of an
items that has been evicted or is eligible to be evicted (but their
execution frequency is too low).  We then set the ageThreshold from
reading out a value from the histogram at a given percentage.  The
percentage is a configuration parameter (defaulted to 80%).
