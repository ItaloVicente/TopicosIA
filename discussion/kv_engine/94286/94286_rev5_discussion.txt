DESCRIPTION:

MB-29013: Add temporal behaviour to hifi_mfu eviction policy

The YSCB workload D is a highly temporal workload.  The current
hfi_mfu eviction policy only relies on execution frequency to make
eviction decisions.

We are therefore are introducing a temporal element into the eviction
decision.  The rule is that if an item has an execution frequency of
zero (it means the the frequency has been decremented either by the
decayer task or the paging visitor) then its eviction decision will be
based solely on being below the execution frequency (which it will be)
and if its eligible for eviction.

If an item has an execution counter greater than zero we only evict
if its age is greater than the ageThreshold.

The ageThreshold is generated using an approach similar to the frequency
threshold.  We maintain an ageHistogram, adding to it if the age of an
items that that has been evicted or eligible to be evicted (exception their
execution frequency is too low).

Happy that this recovers the YSCB workload D performance (actually slightly better than 2-bit LRU).  Appreciate any comments you have DaveR.  Then can clean up and hopefully JimW can review and so can be in Vulcan for when you get back.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might be worth not hardcoding zero, and instead making a configuration.json parameter.

Line:63, engines/ep/src/item_eviction.h -> Do we ever add items independently? Do we expect that an item is always added to both?

If so, you might consider changing the API to there's a single addToHistograms(frequency, age) function - that (1) simplifies the API and (2) maintains the invariant that we always add both fields.

(Similar for the other methods below).

Line:147, engines/ep/src/item_eviction.h -> Might be worth defining what you mean by age (what units, etc).

Line:139, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> Magic number here; would be nicer to pull out as a constant (I think it's also used in the previous header).

Line:167, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> don't we always want to add items to the age histogram, otherwise it won't accurately represent the ages of the population?

Line:138, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> The cas of an item is not guaranteed to be a hybrid logical clock if the item was written before we switch over to HLC cas (i.e. the item was written when the bucket was 4.0/3.x etc...) those items may appear very old or not depending on what their cas is. I don't think this will matter too much, but worth noting/thinking about its impact.

Line:138, engines/ep/src/paging_visitor.h -> nit: current vbucket
