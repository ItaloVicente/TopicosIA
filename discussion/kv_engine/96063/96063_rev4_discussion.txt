DESCRIPTION:

MB-30149: Convert EngineIface::destroy to member function

Change EngineIface::destroy from being a function pointer to a pure
virtual member function.

Note that EventuallyPersistentEngine::destory already exists as a
member function; this is used directly by at least one test to tear
down an EventuallyPersistentEngine object without deallocating the
memory; as such this function has been kept as a separate member
function, but renamed to destroyInner().

Change-Id: I0d3c2fd9214f600b684407b06594b565978d2bf8
