DESCRIPTION:

MB-32108: Introduce HashTable::findFor{Read,Write}

Add two new methods to HashTable for searching for Items -
findForRead() and findForWrite().

As the names imply, these methods search within the HashTable and
return items suitable for reading or writing (modifying).

In this initial patch the functions only differ in their return types
- findForRead() returns a const StoredValue*, findForWrite a non-const
StoredValue* (alongside the associated HashBucketLock. However in the
next patch when we introduce the concept of accessing the Hashtable
via a Committed or Pending perspective; the behaviour of the functions
will change...
