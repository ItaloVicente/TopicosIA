DESCRIPTION:

MB-35133: Allow rollbacks for fewer than half our seqnos

We did not previously allow rollbacks if they were attempting to
rollback more than half our seqno range. This prevented us from
having to deal with the performance impacts of massive rollbacks.
Unfortunately, this makes testing more difficult as we must now
write x items before any test to ensure that we actually can rollback.

Allow rollbacks with fewer than half our seqnos if we have fewer than
10 seqnos to rollback.
