DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Change bytesToEvict to ssize_t

This is the signed type we use when we want a signed size_t and it reads
better than ptrdiff_t.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Wouldn't it be better to refactor the callchain to use ssize_t instead of starting as a std::ptrdiff_t, then pass it on as a std::size_t and finally use a gsl::narrow cast?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This change was made after a discussion on slack re: std::ptrdiff_t vs ssize_t, where I was ultimately convinced that ssize_t is the better type to use here because we use it elsewhere, despite it being non-standard. 

However, I did a bit of reading (after a tip-off from James), and it appears ssize_t is defined in Posix as 
> The type ssize_t shall be capable of storing values at least in the range [-1, {SSIZE_MAX}].

std::make_signed_t<std::size_t> seems like one of the ways forward. However, afaict, make_signed_t for types other keyword integer types (short, int, long...) is undefined until C++17 (ill-formed in C++20). std::size_t is not required to be a typedef for any of these... 

The correct type for our use case is probably int_least64_t and if we have to read into the standard to the T, we probably shouldn't even be using std::size_t in most places we are currently (but int_least64_t or uint_least64_t, and update release notes to say we don't support heaps over 8192 pebibytes). Because std::size_t is not defined to be able to hold the sum of N * sizeof(T).

However, we don't live in imaginary ISO C++ land, so... typedef std::make_signed_t<std::size_t>? 

Not sure what the TL;DR is here :/
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Changing the interface of getEvictionRatios() to take a signed integer exposes details of the implementation of the method. If we did that, the caller would have to gsl::narrow :shrug:
