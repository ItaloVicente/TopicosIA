DESCRIPTION:

MB-47604: Separate public API of KVStore

KVStore currently serves two purposes, it acts as an API for users
of some KVStore and it included code common to all KVStore types.
To introduce an ABKVStore which runs two KVStores in parallel and
compares results of interesting functions we need to separate the
API from the common implementation so that the ABKVStore only needs
to subclass KVStoreIFace.
