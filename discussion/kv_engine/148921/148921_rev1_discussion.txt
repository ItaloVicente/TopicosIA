DESCRIPTION:

MB-44665: Remove deadlock in ADM when catching exception

New debug logging was added to the ADM for MB-41434, to understand
why ActiveDurabilityMonitor::State::updateHighCompletedSeqno() was
throwing due to an invariant failure. But this introduced a deadlock
situation where if updateHighCompletedSeqno() we would catch the thrown
exception and log it. As part of the logging we also want to dump the
ADM's state but this requires a read lock on the ADM's state. Which
can't be taken as we've already taken a write lock in the caller of
updateHighCompletedSeqno().

To remove the dead lock, move the ADM state dump to the calling function
and place the write lock in the write scope. Also keep logging in
updateHighCompletedSeqno() so we definitely know that the exception came
from that function.

Line:895, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> This seems a little odd, given the Ensures() can throw - do you want to catch that or move it outside the block?

Line:1593, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Looks like you're missing a bunch of arguments here - I count 5 '{}' but only two args.

Line:895, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> We need to make sure the write lock on the state is released before we do the logging in the catch. So to move the Ensures() outside of the try{} we would need to take the read lock again which might as a small amount of over head. Also note we re-throw the exception on line 904 and this code should be removed when we've fixed MB-44665. I'm happy to move it out, I'm just not really due what benefit it gives us in the long run?

Line:1593, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Indeed :(

Line:1593, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Assuming you don't care about the resolved queue, I think a better option would be just call operator on *this (which is already locked) - then there's no lock acquisition required.

(Basically the bug here is no methods in State should ever attempt to lock State; given they already must have a locked instance to have access to it).

Line:896, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> MB-41434 is a duplicate of MB-44079 that is fixed now, so all these comments can be removed.
