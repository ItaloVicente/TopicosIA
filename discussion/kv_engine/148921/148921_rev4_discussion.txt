DESCRIPTION:

MB-44665: Remove deadlock in ADM when catching exception

New debug logging was added to the ADM for MB-41434, to understand
why ActiveDurabilityMonitor::State::updateHighCompletedSeqno() was
throwing due to an invariant failure. But this introduced a deadlock
situation where if updateHighCompletedSeqno() we would catch the thrown
exception and log it. As part of the logging we also want to dump the
ADM's state but this requires a read lock on the ADM's state. Which
can't be taken as we've already taken a write lock in the caller of
updateHighCompletedSeqno().

To fix this access each member variable directly as if we're in
updateHighCompletedSeqno() we must have a write lock on the ADM's state.
