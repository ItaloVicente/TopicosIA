DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Move from void to CookieIface for cookie pointers

This patch was created using the following steps:
1. find . -name ‘*.h’ -exec gsed -i 's/void[\s]*\*/CookieIface\*/g' {}
\;
2. find . -name '*.cc' -exec gsed -i 's/void[\s]*\*/CookieIface\*/g' {}
\;
3. Add for dec of CookieIface when needed
4. Add static_cast<const void*>() to any Cookie* being passed to
 spdlogger.
5. Roll back any invalid modifications from void* to CookieIface (e.g
in TopKeys or KVStore interfaces).
6. Revert any changes to engine_common.h to keep the AddStatFn and
AddResponseFn callback definitions the same. As we pass multiple data
types over the cookie arg.
7. Fix clang-tidy warnings related to the changes in the patch
