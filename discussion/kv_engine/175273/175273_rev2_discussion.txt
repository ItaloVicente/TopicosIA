DESCRIPTION:

MB-52053: Set serverless 'num_(reader|writer)_threads' default to 64

During testing for serverless we used 64 reader and writer threads, as
this ensured each tenant had enough threads available to them. Without
any quantifiable in terms of memory usage, CPU cycles or performance
degradation.
