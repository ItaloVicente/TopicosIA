Also as getters for min and max values so that we can test that
modifications to the min and max values are performed atomically.

Line:178, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hdrhistogram_test.cc -> This is probably going to run horrifically slow under TSan - and it's very hard to reason about 1,000 threads as a human.

Recall the Einstein (mis)quote - "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler". 

Two threads are sufficient to trigger a race, as long as they both occur in the temporal window TSan can track. I suggest you change this to use just two threads; and just a single iteration (execution) of each thread; but say calling addValue() ~100 times on each thread.

Note also you can use the ThreadGate class to enforce that each thread has been created and started executing before they both run; to make their use of the Histogram object as close as possible temporally.

Line:178, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hdrhistogram_test.cc -> Done, also I've tested the number of iterations need and I've gone with 10,000 addValue()'s per thread to make sure that we see the failure occur (this was just performed on my local machine)

Line:178, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hdrhistogram_test.cc -> Would be interesting to see how quickly it fails under TSan / how many iterations needed.
