DESCRIPTION:

MB-55078: Extend debug information for unit test failure

The unit test failed because the response didn't contain
the expected JSON, and unfortunately the test failure
don't reveal the returned JSON. Extend the test
to check if the returned JSON payload includes the
expected fields, and if it doesn't fail the test and
print out the content of the JSON
