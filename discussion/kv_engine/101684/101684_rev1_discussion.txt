DESCRIPTION:

Revert "MB-31664: Switch over to not using backfill queue"

This reverts commit 5968b4beaae496e080cbf174259ef01a7dabdabc.

By enqueue the backfill snapshot into the CheckpointManager we may end up OOM and never recover from there.
That is because at Replica we close the open checkpoint (i.e., we make it eligible for removing/deallocating) only when we receive the snapshot-end mutation. So, if disk-snapshot-size > bucket-quota (which is a usual scenario) then we can't recover from OOM at Replica.
