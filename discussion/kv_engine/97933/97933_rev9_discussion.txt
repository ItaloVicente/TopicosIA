DESCRIPTION:

MB-30020 Set error context on MCBP validator failure

Modify all validators in mcbp_validators.cc to set the request cookie's
error context before returning status code upon validator failure. The
corresponding validator tests have been updated to verify the returned
error context.

Line:180, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> A lot of the tests in the file has been changed. I'd prefer that we don't change the actual tests. I have to admit that I'm a bit lukewarm for the entire change as we've changed a ton of code with very limited value (and high risk of introducing regressions given that we've also changed the tests). 

Personally I think we should just add the extended error context to _new_ code.

Line:180, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> Me and Trond discussed this patch. 

The concern about changing the tests (in the same patch) is that if you're broken any of the validator code, if the test was also broken / incorrectly changed then we'd not spot it (i.e. the tests cannot test).

Additionally, your change has highlighted a bunch of code which was admittedly already duplicated, but now it's even larger ;) - i.e. the checks in each function for the size constraints).

What we agreed was the following suggestions to restructure the current Uber-patch :) -

- Patch 1: For validating the common magic / extras / key / body lengths; create a new helper function which checks those fields; returning a {bool success, string description} pair. Then you can update each validator function to use the common function - that'll reduce the size and simplify the change significantly.
- Patch 2: Add tests for the above common validation errorContext additions.
- Patch 3: Add the setErrorContext() for the additional validation checks (non-common code) - e.g. the flags checks at line 198 / 204.
- Patch 4: Add tests for the unique errorContext additions.

Hopefully that should be relatively straightforward to change - if you need some assistance with the git magic needed to split the patches just give me / Paolo / Jim a shout.
