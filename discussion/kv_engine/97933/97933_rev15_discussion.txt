DESCRIPTION:

MB-30020 Use new helper function in mcbp_validators.cc

Modify validators in mcbp_validators.cc to use a common function to
verify the request cookie's header fields, and set the error context
should the validation fail.

(9 comments)

Getting there - still a few comments below.

Could you also include the before / after benchmark times in your comment message.
Line:67, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> Note that not all bits in datatype are currently valid - see mcbp::datatype::highest in protocol_binary.h. Therefore suggest you change the default to that.

Line:107, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> This looks incorrect -you're testing expected_keylen, but the error message talks about extras.

Line:110, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> In general for anything to do with on-the-wire data don't use int / long etc as their sizes vary depending on the archicture. Prefer the correct sized type - uint8_t, uint16_t, uint32_t etc.

Line:119, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> Generally bad practice to treat enumeration values as integers - they are different types. 

Prefer something like:

 if (expected_valuelen != ExectedLen::Zero) {

Line:133, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> Style: When you have a specific set of possible enumeration values, prefer using a switch statement instead of multiple if() statements:

 switch (expected_cas) {
 case ExpectedCas::NotSet:
     ...
 case ExpectedCas::Set:
    ...
 };

This has a couple of advantages:

- It reduces duplication - you remove the repeated `if ((expected_cas == ` code
- It makes it more explicit (to the reader) this is actually a disjoint choice - i.e you're only going to perform one of N code paths.
- The compiler can check that all specified enum values are "covered" by the switch, so if you forget to handle a case you'll get an error (unlike the if above).

(Same for expected_Extras / keylen).

Line:186, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> So I might have mis-read the code earlier / mis-interpreted what you were trying to do,  but I thought you only needed the "any / non-zero etc" checks for a limited set of the fields (say key, but not extras).

As such, while this is better for CAS (we can tell that's Any here), it's still pretty unclear what the other fields are for - and I think it ambiguous / unnecessary to have an "Any" value for extras. Unless I'm mistaken every command has a fixed value / set of values for extra_len.

Similary, I don't think any commands require a specific keylen - it's either zero or non-zero.

As such I'd adjust your function / enums to make this more tightly defined, using the correct type for each expected value which doesn't allow any more variability than it needs - something along the lines of:

 enum class ExpectedKeyLen { Zero, NonZero };
 enum class ExpectedValueLen {Zero, NonZero };
 ...
 verify_header(Cookie& cookie,
    uint8_t expected_extlen // extras is always a specific value, right?
    ExpectedKeyLen expected_keylen, // keylen is always zero or non-zero, right?
    ExpectedValueLen expected_valuelen,// mostly zero / non-zero, right?
    ExpectedCas expected_cas = ExpectedCas::Any,
    uint8_t expected_datatype_mask = mcbp::datatype::highest);

For the few, occasional times when value_len is a fixed amount I'd just special-case that in the specific validator; which simplifies the handling in your common validator function.

Line:20, tests/mcbp/mcbp_bench.cc -> Style: Please order these in the correct order - see https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#include-style

Line:22, tests/mcbp/mcbp_bench.cc -> Probably worth qualifying this name with "Mcbp" or similar as "ValidatorBench" is somewhat ambiguous (the name has scope across the whole of KV-Engine in test results).

Please add a description of what this class is for / what is being tested.

Line:41, tests/mcbp/mcbp_bench.cc -> Style: probably nicer to implement this as a union - unless the reader looks at the constructor for ValidatorBench they won't know that request and blob alias (and changing one changes the other).

Great - thanks for the numbers.

re: the increase from 29ns to 35ns - What do you think? :)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:186, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> The majority of validators accept a single extlen (either fixed or specified by some function). There are, however, also several cases (flush, get_all_vb_seqnos, get_meta, mutate_with_meta, get_locked) where extlen can take multiple values. 

I originally thought this necessitated an any value to allow the extlen check to be special-cased in the validator. However, one can simply pass the headers actual extlen value as the expected extlen to achieve the same effect.

While only two validators need a specific value length, there are several that can accept both a zero or non-zero key, and several that accept both a zero or non-zero value, so both ExpectedKeyLen and ExpectedValueLen still need an any option.
