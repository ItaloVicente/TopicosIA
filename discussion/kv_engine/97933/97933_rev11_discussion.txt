DESCRIPTION:

MB-30020 Use new helper function in mcbp_validators.cc

Modify validators in mcbp_validators.cc to use a common function to
verify the request cookie's header fields, and set the error context
should the validation fail.

Looking much better - thanks for cleaning up the validation code and putting in a single place.

Few comments still - see below:
Line:67, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> Suggest stronger types - magic values (-2, -1) are hard to understand without reading the code / comments; and are error-prone.

Instead declare a enum for the types of check you want to do - i.e. for CAS you seem to have 3 modes - Any, RequireZero, or RequireNonZero  - create an enum with those 3 values and use that.

Line:92, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> Given the fact this is a very common (hot) function, we should verify that the code generated for this is similar in cost to the previous code (assuming no validation errors).

For example, if this function isn't inlined in all call-sites (it's pretty long so the compiler might not...) then we are going to execute pretty much every check each time (i.e. it's not going to constant-propagate `expected_extlen` and friends).

Suggest you add a benchmark for say the top 3-4 operations (GET, SET, ADD, REPLACE) of how quick it is to validate before / after your change.

Take a look at https://hub.internal.couchbase.com/confluence/display/cbeng/KV-Engine+Micro-Benchmarking for info on creating / running microbenchmarks on KV-Engine.

Line:182, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> In reference to my previous comment - from reading the call-site it's pretty unclear to the reader what's actually being checked here - what are all these random -1 / -2 things about?! :)

Line:268, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> Nit: can be constexpr

Line:300, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> Now you've folded these checks into the verify_header() function, the separate local variable doesn't really add anything - I'd just simplify back to:

 if (!verify_header(cookie, 
                    protocol_binary_request_dcp_system_event::getExtrasLength(),
                    -2, -2)) {

(Here and elsewhere...)

Line:396, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> Suggest you hoist this above the other checks - we should always check the header first as that an invalid header potentially prevents us from checking other fields in it.
