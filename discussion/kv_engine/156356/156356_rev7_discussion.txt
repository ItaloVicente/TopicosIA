DESCRIPTION:

MB-35075: Add support for concurrent PagingVisitors

To improve eviction performance, distribute Vbids to multiple
PagingVisitors which may run at the same time.

Each vbucket will still be visited at most once, but more than one may
be visited at a time.

Adds config param `concurrent_pagers` to control how many visitors are
created. This param is _not_ dynamic for now.

*NB*
This patch adds _support_ for concurrent visitors, but currently
defaults to 1, matching the existing behaviour. The default number of
pagers will be increased in a later patch based on perf investigations.

Line:237, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Probably as default setting to the "num of NonIO threads" is a sensible choice.
We could do similar to what we do for thread-pool config here: val=0 means "auto-config", val>0 means "just set to val"

Line:237, engines/ep/configuration.json -> In a later patch, that might be good. As it stands, doing that would have a big negative impact on other NonIO tasks as the PagingVisitor task never yields (which is being fixed). For now the intent is to add the functionality, but not change the default behaviour until it's been tuned up

Line:396, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Not sure there's much value to this comment - if/when the config changes it'll be outdated.

Can you remove in one of your subsequent patches please?

Line:396, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Roger - will remove no later than the patch that makes it false :D

Line:90, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> That does sound more descriptive, will do a followup patch later in the chain
