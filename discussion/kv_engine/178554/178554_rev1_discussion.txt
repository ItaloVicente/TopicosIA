DESCRIPTION:

MB-53100: Improve logging of seqno's during vbucket state change

Sometimes it's not immediately clear what the seqno value of a vbucket
state change will be when placed in the checkpoint manager. So add a new
log message to CheckpointManager::queueSetVBState() to help with this
when reading memcached logs.

Also to ensure we don't impact on performance while logging, move the
log message outside the scope of the lock held on the
CheckpointManager::queueLock.

Line:915, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Isn't this pretty much duplicating that we have in the callers of scheduleVBStatePersist?

Additionally, given this doesn't assign any seqno, item->getBySeqno and vb.getHighSeqno() are always going to be the same, right?

(Our logs are arguably already too verbose, and this is going to add another N log messages when we failover a node, with information which I think is already logged.)

Line:915, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> As set vbucket state is a meta item it doesn't modify the hight seqno and should be the lastBySeqno + 1. It's true that we do log in VBucket::setState_UNLOCKED() however, we don't know that the seqno of the meta item will be at this point given we don't have the queueLock locked at that point in time. So the highSeqno gives us a guide but is not definitive.

Line:915, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I believe we have the vbState lock held for writing which means no other mutations can occur - if not we wouldn't have an atomic seqno transition when we change state.

If you want to log extra info then I'd suggest adding some fields to the existing log lines - for example:

        EP_LOG_INFO(
                "KVBucket::setVBucketState: {} created new failover entry "
                "with uuid:{} and seqno:{}",
                vb->getId(),
                entry.vb_uuid,
                entry.by_seqno);
