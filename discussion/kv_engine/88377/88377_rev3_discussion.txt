DESCRIPTION:

MB-27554: [BP] Centralize HashTable count statistics

Originally 4f6873e8343698e360fb3c30bf73175916d0dd22

HashTable maintains a number of statistics about how many StoredValues
it contains which match some criteria - for example number of
non-resident, number with a given datatype, etc.

Ensuring the count of these statistics is accurate is currenly
error-prone - each of the different operations which may result in the
count changing needs to take care to update the relevent stat(s).

To make this more robust, refactor the counting of these statistics so
it is centrallised in two symmetric methods - statsPrologue() and
statsEpilogue(). statsPrologue should be called before making any
changes which may affect any of the stats (i.e. whenever a StoredValue
is changed), and statsEpilogue should be called afterwards.

By moving the all stats accounting to two methods (which are vitually
identical) we should minimise any accounting issues.
