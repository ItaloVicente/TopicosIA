DESCRIPTION:

MB-55086: Increase default number of NonIO threads to 0.5 * nCPUs

Increase from 30% of CPU core count to 50%. From the code comment:

This used to be a smaller coefficient, but since the introduction of
SyncWrites we require NonIO tasks to run to complete them (both DCP
ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask and DurabilityCompletionTask) and
hence we have increased the coefficient, based on empirical testing.

We could likely increase further, however if there was a problem with
other NonIO tasks consuming excessive CPU that could start to impact
front-end threads, so let's increase this gradually...
