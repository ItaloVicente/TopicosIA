DESCRIPTION:

MB-41403: Simplify ExpiredItemPager management

Previously, a new ExpiredItemPager would be created every time a expiry
config parameter was changed.

The task may create a single PagingVisitor, but has no way of
preventing a different task instance creating another while one is
still runnning. Thus, repeatedly changing the config could lead to
multiple visitors existing at the same time.

Additionally, KVBucket::setExpiryPagerSleeptime recreated the task but
did not supply an initial task runtime, even if one had been set in the
config. As a result, the order in which config params are changed would
lead to different results; the initial task run time may or may not be
respected.

Fixed by having a single, long lived ExpiredItemPager which contains a
changeable config.

Line:153, engines/ep/src/item_pager.h -> Just pass by value; std::chrono::seconds is a simple-enough type (it's 2 words or less).
