DESCRIPTION:

MB-38428: Run flusher and compactor in parallel

Release the exclusive lock for the vbucket while doing the
full compaction of the vbucket and then run 10 attempts
to catch up without holding the lock while replaying the
changes.

To make sure that we don't "race" forever trying to catch up
we'll hold the lock the last time we try to catch up.

There has been a number of bugs where the number of prepares
found on disk differs from the number in _local/vbstate so
this patch also includes a check which scans the on disk prepares
and compares the number with whats stored in _local/vbstate.
That piece of code is to be deleted once we've verified that
everything is as expected.

Line:1179, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Do we also need to do something similar for collection counts?

Line:1468, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> This is similar to the code in count_prepares_callback() - can we pull it into a common helper function?

Line:1179, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> From the commit hook we currently had was:

     PendingLocalDocRequestQueue localDocQueue;
                    if (hook_ctx->eraserContext
                                ->needToUpdateCollectionsMetadata()) {
                        if (!hook_ctx->eraserContext->empty()) {
                            std::stringstream ss;
                            ss << "CouchKVStore::compactDBInternal finalising "
                                  "dropped collections, container should be "
                                  "empty"
                               << *hook_ctx->eraserContext << std::endl;
                            throw std::logic_error(ss.str());
                        }
                        // Need to ensure the 'dropped' list on disk is now gone
                        localDocQueue.emplace_back(
                                Collections::droppedCollectionsName,
                                CouchLocalDocRequest::IsDeleted{});
                    }
                    auto ret = maybePatchOnDiskPrepares(
                            compacted,
                            hook_ctx->stats.preparesPurged,
                            localDocQueue,
                            vbid);
                    if (ret == COUCHSTORE_SUCCESS) {
                        ret = updateLocalDocuments(compacted, localDocQueue);
                    }

We would only delete the document containing dropped collections.

(there is a "bug" in here that they will "reappear" in newer versions of the documnt if we had muations being flushed at the same time, but that should only cause collections in dead cids to be deleted "one more time" (none found)).

Line:1179, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Sorry, I wasn't very specific.

What I mean is - don't we have the same problem with the collection stats documents, whereby we don't correctly track if a mutation to a collection was an inset or a replace?
