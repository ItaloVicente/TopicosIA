DESCRIPTION:

MB-29108: Create connection stats task to fix concurrent access conditions

Creates a new StatsTask class, which is to be used from the Stats Command
Context.

Implement a StatsTask_ConnectionStats class which is used to get the
connection stats, and use this in place of connection_stats function
in connections.cc.

Remove the unused code from connections.cc in favour of the new
Task based system as this avoids the race conditions when getting
tasks for connections on a different thread.

Line:989, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> nit: the shared_ptr have a bool operator ;)

Line:991, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> nit: Given that you always return ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK here it would be easier to read if you use the constant (instead of having to read the comment / check above to check it)

Line:58, daemon/stats_tasks.cc -> You should include cookie.getEventId() as that's returned back to the client so clients have a token they may use to look in the server logs.

Line:43, daemon/stats_tasks.h -> This isn't used (and the error variable is only written to and never read so it may be deleted. We log it and return an error back to the client anyway)

Line:57, daemon/stats_tasks.h -> A bit weird mix of camel case? (do we really need the extra "StatsTask class" at all? given that we don't use it? seems like a better idea to refactor it out iff we ever end up needing it (and need to share code)

Line:642, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> Instead of changing the prototype of every stats method (adding an argument which is mostly unused), I suggest you use Cookie::obtainContext() to get a reference to the StatsContext, and then call a new method on that to inform it of the new task.

Line:1002, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> You're dereferencing a pointer without checking for null. Either add an explicit check, or change the reinterpret_cast (which should actually be a dynamic_cast) to the reference version, which will throw an exception for you (bad_cast IIRC) if the pointer is of the wrong type.

Line:31, daemon/stats_tasks.h -> Needs a description.

Line:43, daemon/stats_tasks.h -> Done

Line:57, daemon/stats_tasks.h -> Will fix the class name. As for needing the extra class, I think it makes sense to leave it in as it provides easy scope to expand in the future and it also makes the stats_context code cleaner rather than (if we removed the base class), have to check what the command key is and get the appropriate task etc etc...
