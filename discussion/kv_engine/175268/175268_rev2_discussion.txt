DESCRIPTION:

Revert initial fix for MB-51606

Since recent changes to notify persistence to ADM when vBucket is dead
(MB-51606), we attempt to update the ADM to account for the new
persisted seqno. This can cause a crash if there are ActiveSyncWrite
objects in trackedWrites which do not have any chain information - see
MB-52169.

As per discussions with QE, the latest bug (MB-52169) has a larger
impact than the original MB-51606, and hence in the short-term (while
we investigate the best way to fix both issues) we will revert the
original fix for MB-51606.
