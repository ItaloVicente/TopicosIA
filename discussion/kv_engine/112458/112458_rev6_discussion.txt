DESCRIPTION:

MB-35061: Ensure correct ConnHandler is removed

In ConnMap::removeVBConnByVBId_UNLOCKED we might break early if we find
a weak_ptr we could not lock.

If we do this, we might accidentally leave the connection we were
trying to remove (matched by cookie).

Methods like like DcpConnMap::seqnoAckVBPassiveStream assume there will
only be one ConnHandler found. If an "old" ConnHandler is left in the
ConnMap, these methods will find that first, and will perform their
action on the wrong ConnHandler.
