Line:148, engines/ep/src/globaltask.cc -> Not sure this is the correct place for this - by the time the GlobalTask::operator delete is called, the GlobalTask object has already been destructed and hence I *believe* is invalid to access.

I think we need to do this at a high level. Where are GlobalTask objects destroyed from? Can we not do the onThreadSwitch there?

It's true UBSan has in the past been upset by the cast of the void* to Object* in the delete function, as the destructor has executed it's no longer a valid Object.

In terms of where they delete from, a number of places could delete as the task is managed via a shared_ptr

maybe could get away with switch to engine inside the GlobalTask dtor, and use the operator delete function here to switch back to null

That sounds reasonable - at least we arn't touching the object then :)
