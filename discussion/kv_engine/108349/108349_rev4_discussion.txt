DESCRIPTION:

MB-23086: Run and delete GlobalTask on the correct engine

This commit aims to be more careful about the scoping of the
engine in thread-local storage (ObjectRegistry) in preparation
for the final functional patch of MB-23086.

ExecutorThread should in general never have any allocation/deallocation
accounted to an engine, the ExecutorThread is part of the global tasking
infrastructure. So GlobalTask is now in charge of scoping the
ObjectRegistry by

1) wrapping GlobalTask::run in a new method ::execute, the execute
method  places the task's engine into ObjectRegistry and returns to
whatever used to be there when done.

2) Using a GlobalTask delete operator in conjunction with ~GlobalTask.
The destructor of GlobaTask now always places the task's engine into the
ObjectRegistry with the assumption being that in general after
~GlobalTask is invoked the task will be deallocated (and cb::free can
then account to the engine). The job of delete operator is to now always
set nothing into ObjectRegistry. This means that the majority of task
deletion, which occurs in ExecutorThread, leaves the global
ExecutorThread disassociated with an engine.

The fallout of these changes are that a few other parts of the code need
to manage the ObjectRegistry, e.g. non ExecutorThread code that handles the
destruction of GlobalTask

Line:82, engines/ep/src/globaltask.cc -> maybe able to reduce this patch down, switching to null here was for the benefit of the ExecutorThread, so that post delete of tasks, no stale engine can be left in ObjectReg, ExecutorThread could do this manually
