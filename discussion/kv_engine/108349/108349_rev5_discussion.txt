DESCRIPTION:

MB-23086: Run and delete GlobalTask on the correct engine

This commit aims to be more careful about the scoping of the
engine in thread-local storage (ObjectRegistry) in preparation
for the final functional patch of MB-23086.

ExecutorThread should in general never have any allocation/deallocation
accounted to an engine, the ExecutorThread is part of the global tasking
infrastructure. Upstream of this patch problems also occur if the
ExecutorThread leaves an engine in the ObjectRegistry and the engine
is deleted. Thus the main aim of the change is to have the
ExecutorThread::run function use null in ObjectRegistry and only switch
to an engine when the engine is valid and needed.

1) wrapping GlobalTask::run in a new method ::execute, the execute
method  places the task's engine into ObjectRegistry and returns to
whatever used to be there when done. This works because preceding this
patch is a change which ensures an engine will wait until it has deleted
its tasks.

2) Switch to the engine for ExecutorPool cancel, only in the case of
task deletion. This uses a new BucketAllocationGuard to manage the
switching.
