DESCRIPTION:

MB-43028: [1/2] Make overhead tracking safe at VBucket destruction

Cherry-picks http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/141492

Note: This patch is cherry-picked as the issue it resolves prevents
clean forward-merging of a change _earlier_ in mad-hatter history.

Merging http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/136495 into master
uncovered santizer issues (mad-hatter CV runs an older Clang and did
not identify these issues).

This patch resolves one of these issues, before the above patch may
be merged to master.

During VBucket destruction, the CheckpointManager member, and any
remaining Checkpoints it holds are destroyed. This can trigger the
memOverheadChangedCallback, as destroying Checkpoints reduces the
memory overhead.

This was unsafe, as the state member had already been destroyed as it
is declared later in VBucket.

Move the CheckpointManager to be declared after state, so it is
destroyed first.
