DESCRIPTION:

MB-46272: Don't remove resolved sync-writes when getting cookies

Currently ActiveDurabilityMonitor::getCookiesForInFlightSyncWrites()
isn't idempotent with respect to the sync-writes stored in
resolvedQueue. As it removes ActiveSyncWrite when trying to get hold of
their cookie so we can give an ambiguous status to the client.

This is problematic as before this patch the DurabilityCompletionTask
and DurabilityTimeoutTask could run after
getCookiesForInFlightSyncWrites() is called. This could mean that we end
up completing and persisting sync-writes to disk out of order. Due to
the sync-writes that where in resolvedQueue being removed before they
had be process by the DurabilityCompletionTask.

To fix this we've modified getCookiesForInFlightSyncWrites() to leave
the resolvedQueue in a valid state, with all the sync-writes that it had
before still there and in the same order, just with their cookie
removed. To do this we take hold of a write lock to the ADM state and
also the resolvedQueue consumer lock. This should give use exclusive
access so both the resolvedQueue and trackedWrites. Then we go though
the resolvedQueue removing ActiveSyncWrites and cache them in a vector.
To restore the state of the resolvedQueue we reset the queue after its
empty and re-push all the ActiveSyncWrites.

We also cancel the DurabilityCompletionTask and DurabilityTimeoutTask so
that we don't try to time out or complete any more sync-writes when we
can no-longer inform the client of the result.

think we need a comment on the locking
Line:1009, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> it would be worth justifying that we need to acquire this lock here to prevent completions from coming in while we shuffle about the resolvedQ

Line:4830, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> nit - feel free to leave as is: personally wouldn't overcomplicate the test with this, checking we flush 2 items at the end (rather than 1 before the fix) is probably enough

Line:1009, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Good point to amend

Line:4830, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> Know what you mean was just to ensure that we completed the aborts in order.

Line:1009, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Not sure how safe it is to acquire both the producer (State lock) and consumer lock concurrently (resolvedQueue->getConsumerLock()) - the expectation is a thread only every acquires one at once.

I follow the need to acquire both (you need to ensure the producer doesn't try to add things before we have re-added); but not convinced it's safe.

Line:859, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> I'm not sure this is necessary or sufficient to actually stop these tasks running. 

You might cancel them here, but they could already be running (in an arbitrary point in their run() method.

Line:859, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> :indeed:, though this is more of an optimisation to stop ensure we don't get them to do any further work. getCookiesForInFlightSyncWrites() will have to wait for any timeout/completion task to finish before executing as we need the state write lock and ResolvedQueue::ConsumerLock lock.

Line:859, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> I'm not sure it's really going to be an optimisation in reality - you're creating more work to actually cancel the task (take locks on the ExecutorPool logic etc).

I think we should just remove this.
