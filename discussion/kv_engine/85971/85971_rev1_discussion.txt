DESCRIPTION:

MB-26973 Prevent the CV KV-testsuite to run out of disk space under RocksDB

RocksDB pre-allocates disk space for the MANIFEST and WAL files by
default. The 'test dcp early termination' test showed that RocksDB
pre-allocates ~75MB per DB, ~7.5GB for 100 empty DBs created.
To prevent any test to run out of space, we set 'allow_fallocate=false'
as baseline configuration for all the testsuites.
