DESCRIPTION:

MB-52054: Make stat "vbucket-durability-state" ~4x faster

Currently every time ns_server asks for VBucket stats we return the
topology of the vbucket, this turns out to be more costly than needed as
we store the topology as a nlohmann::json object which need to be dumped
to a string. nlohmann::json::dump() method isn't the most efficient
implementation so we should avoid using it too much. So we should store
the topology as a std::string after it has been validated, as we expect
the stat call to be called more frequently than performing topology
changed.

Performing before and after using
VBucketDetailsBench/VBucketDurabilityState.

Line:191, engines/ep/benchmarks/stats_bench.cc -> I believe there's only one chain in the topology in steady-state - are you seeing two in cappella logs?

We will do during takeover but don't believe we will in steady state. Just forgot the chaining structure will remove them :)
