DESCRIPTION:

MB-30916: Out one result in QueueDirtyWithManyClosedUnrefCheckpoints

Currently our CBNT scripts don't support the parsing of multiple GBench
Repetition output lines, '_mean' and '_stddev'.
Thus, I just run Iterations so that GBench outs one single result.
Note that I've chosen the number of Iterations looking at the std-dev
and keeping it low.

Bench run output with at current stage (regression):

Line:35, /COMMIT_MSG -> What actually /would/ be a useful change to the CBNT import script would be to allow specifying which attribute of a benchmark to track/graph.

For example, here "best" metric is probably "items/s" as that's the most direct measurement of what we care about.

@Paolo - could you discuss with Tim about adjusting the script (maybe using the filter stuff)? to be able to specify which metric to use for a given benchmark?

Line:35, /COMMIT_MSG -> Sure.
As you said, here the metric to track is the usual "items/s".
So, it seems that this patch can be merged even before the change that you propose?

Line:35, /COMMIT_MSG -> Well, if you merge it but CBNT isn't tracking a meaningful statistic, then there's limited value on recording the numbers. 

Ask Tim if he can tweak his existing patch - hopefully should be straightforward

Line:35, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yeah I'll discuss with Tim.
We've just looked together at the CBNT result for this patch (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/99982/, http://172.23.104.96/db_default/v4/kv-engine/cv/1045).
It seems ok even as it is now, because CBNT is tracking "items/s".
The only reason why we don't have a delta is because that one is the first run.

How come? Does benchmark2xml.py already pick "item/s" as the metric to track?

Line:35, /COMMIT_MSG -> Oh wait, that's what I (incorrectly) thought ! 
Forget my last message, I've just looked at the script and we pick time! :(

Line:35, /COMMIT_MSG -> Will jump in here, so CBNT currently tracks time only, and does so in a smaller is better metric. This means even if you did some trickery and renamed throughput to time to trick CBNT into tracking it, it would consider results where the value has increased to be bad - even though for throughput, bigger is better. In theory there is the ability in CBNT somewhere to track results as "bigger is better" however I am not sure if we can track this on a test by test basis, and if so, how we even go about setting that

Line:35, /COMMIT_MSG -> Just looked through the CBNT code, as it stands there is no way to track bigger is better on a test by test bases. I would suggest plotting 1/throughput however this number would get so small that it would be rounded to 0 and lose all accuracy...

@Tim This is an example of xml output:

<testsuites timestamp="2018-11-02T11:05:31">
  <testsuite name="CheckpointBench">
    <testcase name="QueueDirtyWithManyClosedUnrefCheckpoints/100/iterations:50" time="12972737.000000" classname="CheckpointBench"/>
    <testcase name="QueueDirtyWithManyClosedUnrefCheckpoints/100/iterations:50/cpu_time" time="349300.000000" classname="CheckpointBench"/>
  </testsuite>
</testsuites>

If I understand correctly, CBNT tracks "time", so we are ok.
