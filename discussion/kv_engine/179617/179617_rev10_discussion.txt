DESCRIPTION:

MB-49071: Make engine-specific storage type-safe [2/2]

Using an interface type for the engine-specific storage allows us to
avoid reinterpret_casts from void* and to use smart pointers for
automatic memory management of objects with lifetime bound by the
command context.

This patch replaces the void*-based engine specific API of ep-engine
with a type-safe alternative and updates all callers to use it.
