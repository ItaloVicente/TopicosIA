DESCRIPTION:

Make the max size for the send queue tunable

Introduce a new tunable: max_send_queue_size and set it to
40MB by default (2x the maximum document size)

When the send queue exceeds this limit we'll stop accepting
new commands (and not insert new dcp messages) until the
client drains the socket.
