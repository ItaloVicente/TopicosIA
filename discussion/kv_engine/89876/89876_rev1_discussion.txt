DESCRIPTION:

MB-28318: Ensure all executor/tasks are finished

The test has a race in that it reads the executionComplete
boolean, but a task may logically be complete but yet to
reach the function which sets it to true.

If we destroy the ExecutorPool, all threads should
finish and join allowing for safe evaluation of the bool
