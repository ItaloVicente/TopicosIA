DESCRIPTION:

Report throttle time in the response message

Allow the server to inject a frame info in the response
containing the time the server waited before starting to
execute the command.

This information would let the client know why they're seeing
slow operations and possibly take the appropriate actions.

The frame info field will only be inserted if the command was
throttled.

Lets agree on the spec before implementing the backend

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Given this is changing the wire protocol I think we want an MB for it to track / allow SDKs etc to refer to.

Line:283, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> Is there any other information which could be useful to the client - for example the type of CU which there were throttled for?

Line:291, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> Throttle Duration?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> sure. Just wanted to figure out if we're going to do this before spending time with all the overhead.

Line:283, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> There is only one type (initially I thought it would be multiple, but according to the requirement spec the throttle limit is (RCU+WCU))

Line:291, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> Damn.. my copy'n'paste error ;)
