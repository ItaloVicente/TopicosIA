DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Create parameterized Collections tests

Refactor collections tests to run under EP and Ephemeral. Move tests
that run under both bucket types to a new collections_test.cc file.
Leave the EP only tests in the evp_store_collections_test.cc file.

Further work needs to be done to refactor collections warmup and
expiry tests.
