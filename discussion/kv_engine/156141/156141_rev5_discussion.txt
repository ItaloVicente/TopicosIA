Please don't remove BuildBot -1 votes. 

The failures you saw are probably due to your patch being based off kv_engine/master from 3rd June. I expect if rebase to current head your patch should pass.

I did not remove a BuildBot vote -- I just removed BuildBot itself because in my understanding this change should not actually build yet as the GSI JSON file it references is not yet in the GSI master branch (only the GSI unstable branch). (Likely I do not understand the mechanics of KV BuildBot. Does removing the bot remove not only its desire to run, but also its past votes? I see the past votes still in the history. Do you like BuildBot to be always on even if it fails? In GSI failing bots cause lots of problems for other people so I thought I should remove it.)

From our Slack convo rebase may fix many errors that are not due to my change. I will still expect it to fail due to missing GSI JSON file tho.
