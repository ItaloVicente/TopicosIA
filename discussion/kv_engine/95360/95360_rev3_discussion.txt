DESCRIPTION:

MB-30008: Avoid fluctuation in HashTable::numItems during eviction

Problem
-------

As seen during commit validation, 'test access scanner' in
ep_testsuite.value_eviction intermittently fails with an item count
mismatch:

    Running [0036/0152]: test access scanner (couchstore)...Expected 2600 curr_items after Wrong number of items, got 2599
    (1715 ms) DIED

curr_items returns a value one fewer than the expected item count.

Investigation has found that the root cause of this is how the
HashTable handles statistics updates; specifically the paired
prologue()/epilogue() functions around HashTable mutators.

Catching the issue in GDB we see that at the point of the mismatch,
there's a background thread in the middle of ejecting items:

    #7  HashTable::Statistics::epilogue (this=<optimised out>, v=...) at kv_engine/engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc:393
    #8  0x00007fffee06520b in HashTable::unlocked_ejectItem (this=<optimised out>, vptr=@0x7fffe84b3638: 0x7d10000295c0, policy=VALUE_ONLY) at kv_engine/engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc:770
    #9  0x00007fffee00e892 in EPVBucket::pageOut (this=0x7d680000f600, lh=..., v=@0x476e7d: 0xfffb812be8c68949) at kv_engine/engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc:444

Note in frame #7 we are at line 393 in HashTable::Statistics::epilogue
- which is before we re-increment numItems at line 400 - i.e. while
paging out we decrement numItems in prologue(); incrementing it in
epilogue().

While the counts are /eventually/ correct; if we get unlucky with when
we read the number of items and read between prologue() & epilogue();
then we can see an item count which is off-by-one.

This is true for any operation which only modifies existing HashTable
items (e.g. update, eject); and it's also the case for other stats.

Solution
--------

Address this issue by changing how Hashtable stats are updated. We
keep the paired prologue() / epilogue() approach, but instead of the
prologue effectively removing the old StoredValue from stats (and the
epilogue adding it back in), we instead use the prologue() to capture
the statistics related properties of the old StoredValue; and then use
this state in the epilogue() to modify only the stats which have
changed in the new StoredValue.

In addition to avoiding the stats fluctuation seen in this test; this
change also reduces the amount of 'churn' on the HashTable counters;
which should reduce the amount of cache line ping-ponging seen.

Microbenchmark results show a slight speedup in replace performance;
create and delete performance are similar:

Before:

    HashTableBench/Delete/threads:8         674 ns       3178 ns     241160

After:

    Benchmark                                 Time           CPU Iterations
