DESCRIPTION:

MB-37433: test item pager: Don't expect pager has run after TMPFAIL

Currently the test expects that something is ejected by the pager
after it gets a TMPFAIL. This may not necessarily happen as memory
may drop back below the watermark before the flusher runs. The test
actually has a fallback to deal with this so remove the failure case
and allow the fallback to attempt to force the pager to run instead.
