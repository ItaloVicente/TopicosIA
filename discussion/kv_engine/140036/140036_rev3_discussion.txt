DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor] Pass cookie as cb::tracing::Traceable&

Changed all methods in EngineIface to accept a Traceable as
the cookie to the methods in the engine interface. All of the
engines continue to use a "const void*" pointer so we can
do the migration over to use cb::tracing::Traceable over time
without having to touch the entire codebase in a single
commit
