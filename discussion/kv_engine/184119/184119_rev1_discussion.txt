DESCRIPTION:

Merge commit 'couchbase/neo' into 'couchbase/master'

* commit '206fd0132':

Conflicts:
    engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h
    engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc

Note on this merge - this code was already mostly merged
in a previous forward merge, but a mistake was made fixing
the unit-test. This merge fixes that by updating dcp_stream_test
to use the runNextTask instead of a direct call to run on the
ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask.

A second mistake is addressed switching a test hook from std::function
back to TestHook
