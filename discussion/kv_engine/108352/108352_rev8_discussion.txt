Not sure if this is worth the amount of code added.

See http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/108353/ for patch using this class.

I looked into adding the locks in ConnMap into ConnStore too. We hold locks on the cookie to connection map for longer than single operations though and I didn't want to rework that/introduce new bugs at the same time. Could possibly have moved the vbConnsLocks into ConnStore, but seems odd to have some of the locks required but not all.

Fair enough. Can leave it on Gerrit for now, maybe we can revisit it later.

Patch Set 8: Code-Review+2

(6 comments)
Line:66, engines/ep/src/conn_store.cc -> could do

 if(existing) {

here?

Line:102, engines/ep/src/conn_store.cc -> Are we using aliasing shared pointers here? I thought these would be equivalent if we are not, but there may be cases I've not come across

Line:134, engines/ep/src/conn_store.cc -> Might this find an unrelated conn that happens to be an expired weak pointer?
rather than the first conn which is unexpired with the right name, a la
 
 conn.lock() && name == conn.lock()->getName();

Also, the shared pointer refcount will be being bumped up twice but I guess this won't be hot enough to worry?

Line:68, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/conn_store_test.cc -> would

 list.back().lock()

not do the same?

Line:69, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/conn_store_test.cc -> Just to check, does

 ASSERT_TRUE(ptr);

work equivalently?

Line:269, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/conn_store_test.cc -> similarly to before, is

 list.front().lock()

not the same?

Not a huge difference in this case though

Comment from you, Ben. investigate ensuring we do not have more consumers than expected in vbconns
