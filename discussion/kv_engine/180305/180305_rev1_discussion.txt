DESCRIPTION:

Add an indication for the next throttle tick

Insert '{ "next_tick_us" : <number> }' in the response message
for EWouldThrottle responses. That would give the client a
hint for when we think the next tick will run on the server.

The client may use the value as a hint for how long it should
back off before retrying the operation. Note that the value
is not accurate as it is another thread which perform the
tick on the buckets and it performs the tick in sequence
bucket by bucket.

Line:636, daemon/connection.cc -> using namespace std::chrono

might cut down some of the cruft for ease of reading

Line:639, daemon/connection.cc -> nit these parentheses seem unnecessary?

Line:646, daemon/connection.cc -> will this definitely never exceed 1s, even if e.g., this thread gets pre-empted just after calling now() for some arbitrary time?

If it might exceed 1s, may be worth clamping the delta

Line:98, tests/testapp_serverless/throttle_test.cc -> This can also be expressed as

EXPECT_THAT(...get<int>(), AllOf(Gt(0),Lt(1000000)));

(but that might actually be less readable than the existing, so never mind - just mentioning it)

Line:646, daemon/connection.cc -> Ah no, ignore, followed it through properly.

Though that's a +1 for dropping the std::chrono noise for ease of reading ;)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Marco is the "client" for this and he's CC'd on the review... It seems like an unnecessary overhead to create a jira ticket just to have something in the commit message when both parties know when it'll be added and the format of it...

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> So this isn't being (and won't in the future be) coordinated with any SDKs or anything? If not, 👍

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's not just to have a nice tag here, it's because people do reference jira long after a change is done, even non-KV folks who might not have the same background knowledge to know the full impact of this change offhand. (e.g., "Bah there's a bug, did QE know check that this all worked together before release??", or "This broke X, needs reverting for now, who else needs to be made aware - is it all SDKs? Just 'internal' client SDKs? Just Marco? An MB linked to changes in other components would be super handy right now!")

+2 anyway, but it's still worth saying that while jira is an overhead, it's not for no reason at all ;)
