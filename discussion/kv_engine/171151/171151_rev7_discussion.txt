DESCRIPTION:

MB-51104: Allow ItemExpel for open Checkpoints without cursors

Item expelling does not currently occur for Ephemeral vBuckets which
do not have any cursors registered - for example replica vBuckets.

This seems accidental - it is because of pre-flight check in
CheckpointManager::extractItemsToExpel() which returns early if it
finds the oldest checkpoint (where expel must begin) contains zero
cursors - with the rationale that if a Checkpoint has zero cursors in
it, we could just discard the entire Checkpoint which is cheaper than
expelling individual items.

However the check is flawed - in the case of a VBucket without any
cursors at all (such as Ephemeral without any DCP producers), the Open
Checkpoint meets this critera, however that _cannot_ be deleted.

Fixing the check is easy - also check that the checkpoint is closed
before performing the early return - however to actually make Item
Expel work for Ephemeral requires a few additional changes, given the
lowest cursor is normally used to determine where to start expelling
from.

Add a new variant of CheckpointRemoverTest memory expel tests which
checks item expel behaviour when there is zero cursors registered (as
is the case for Ephemeral buckets without any DCP producer cursors).
