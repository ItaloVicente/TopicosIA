DESCRIPTION:

Merge remote-tracking branch 'review/watson_ep' into spock

Fixup history to bring ep-engine/watson and kv_engine/watson_ep into
alignment - they already contained the same code; however the last
couple of patch migrations from ep-engine/watson -> kv_engine were
incorrectly done as cherry-picks and hence the SHAs are not matching.

This merges the "no-op" ep-engine/watson <-> kv_engine/watson_ep sync
merge into spock; meaning that the spock branch is again a superset of
watson.

* review/watson_ep:
  MB-25464: Do not exit cbstats if stats_perform fails
  MB-25238: Add logging to destruction of store
  [BP] MB-25337: Handle the vbucket state change gracefully during rollback
