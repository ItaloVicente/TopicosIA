DESCRIPTION:

MB-40718: Pending Prepare does not expire

TTL for SyncWrite is legal, but the document is supposed to expire if /
when it is committed.
Multiple paths in our code (eg, backfill) may access a logically-expired
Prepare and process the expire. That is wrong and may crash the
memcached process, as in the case of backfill that makes the call in a
BG thread.

The fix in this patch ensures that the expire never happens on a
pending Prepare and that it does happen after the item is committed.

Line:1382, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> It looks like findForRead will only return prepared items if isPreparedMaybeVisible() is true - so we must be in a situation where the ownership of a vBucket changes or after warmup?

I don't believe this changes your fix, but it would be useful to clarify this in the commit message to accurately describe when this issue could occur.

Line:1382, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Too late :)
I had this patch on gerrit on master as initially though to go in CC, mad-hatter patch already submitted.
As discussed, correct, whether warmup or vbstate change (active -> non-active)
