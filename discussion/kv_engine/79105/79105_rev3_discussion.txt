DESCRIPTION:

MB-20940: Remove ship_mcbp_tap_log

TAP is going to to be removed (and is currently disabled by not
allowing anyone to connect to it). This patch nukes the
ship_mcbp_tap_log method as I don't want to spend time fixing
the buffer patch to work on top of TAP when we're going to kill it
anyway.
