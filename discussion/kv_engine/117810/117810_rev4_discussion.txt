DESCRIPTION:

MB-23086: Delete all bucket tasks before deleting the bucket

Currently the EventuallyPersistentEngine is deleted whilst tasks are
still owned by the ExecutorPool. The tasks themselves shouldn't be 'ran'
(i.e. invoke Task::run), but the task's engine pointer is still being
used in onSwitchThread calls.

This currently causes no problem because the 'invalid' pointer isn't
dereferenced... yet.

This commit changes the bucket delete path so that the thread driving
the bucket destruction, gathers all task objects and waits until they
can be deleted (use_count is 1), then does the task delete.

This commit includes a change in the GlobalTask destructor which now
dereferences the engine pointer to more easily catch (via ASAN) if  any
destruction ordering issue remains.
