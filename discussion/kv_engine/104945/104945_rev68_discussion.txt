DESCRIPTION:

MB-32591: Expel checkpoint items that are no longer required

This patch introduces the ability to expel items from the oldest
checkpoint that still has cursors in it.  This can include the open
checkpoint.

The reason for expelling items is to reduce the size of checkpoints.
It achieves this by identifying the oldest checkpoint that has cursors
still in it.  Then identify where the first cursor is located. For
example in the diagram below it is seqno 1004.

                  low                                high
           dummy seqno                              seqno
             |     |                                  |
             |     |                                  |
            \./   \./                                \./
         --------------------------------------------------
         | 1000 | 1001 | 1002 | 1003 | 1004 | 1005 | 1006 |
         --------------------------------------------------
                                       /.\           /.\
                                        |             |
                                        |             |
                                     cursor 1      cursor 2

It then expels items from the start of the checkpoint (ejects from
memory) up to where the first cursor is located.  In the diagram this
means expelling 1000, 1001, 1002 and 1003.  The item at seqno 1004
becomes the new dummy item.

After the expel operation the checkpoint appears as follows.

                 low     high
           dummy seqno   seqno
            |      |      |
            |      |      |
           \./    \./    \./
         ---------------------
          1004 | 1005 | 1006 |
         ---------------------
           /.\           /.\
            |             |
            |             |
         cursor 1      cursor 2

Not looked at the code yet, but wanted to understand the overall approach more. 

Suggest you also document the config param in the commit message.
Line:39, /COMMIT_MSG -> Is it safe for us to actually change the low seqno of a checkpoint - particularly a closed one?

We currently assume the low seqno is immutable; and various things check it (DCP cursor registration, rollback; etc). I was assuming we'd still keep the low seqno @1001; but add extra logic to not allow access to any elements before the low_present_seqno (or whatever you've named it).

Line:39, /COMMIT_MSG -> The low seqno is calculated as taking from begin (and jumping over the dummy) - ie. I could not see it held as a specific value.  It is  used in registerCursorBySeqno_UNLOCKED to detemine where to calculate the start as being before or in the current checkpoint.

I originally created an expel seqno (in addition to the low seqno) and changed to the appropriate cases to use expel seqno (as opposed to the low seqno). i.e. in the registerCursorBySeqno_UNLOCKED.  Then realised that was all the uses case.  And hence did not need the separate expel case.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:39, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ok - if that's the only use-case makes sense.
