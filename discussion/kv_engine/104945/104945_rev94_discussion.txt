DESCRIPTION:

MB-32591: Expel checkpoint items that are no longer required

This patch introduces the ability to expel items from the oldest
checkpoint that still has cursors in it.  This can include the open
checkpoint.

The reason for expelling items is to reduce the size of checkpoints.
It achieves this by identifying the oldest checkpoint that has cursors
still in it.  Then identify where the first cursor is located. For
example in the diagram below it is seqno 1004.

                  low                                high
           dummy seqno                              seqno
             |     |                                  |
             |     |                                  |
            \./   \./                                \./
         --------------------------------------------------
         | 1000 | 1001 | 1002 | 1003 | 1004 | 1005 | 1006 |
         --------------------------------------------------
                                       /.\           /.\
                                        |             |
                                        |             |
                                     cursor 1      cursor 2

It then expels items from the start of the checkpoint (ejects from
memory) up to and including  where the first cursor is located.  In
the diagram this means expelling 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003 and 1004. A
new dummy is created at the position of where the last cursor pointed
and is assigned the same seqno as the previous dummy.

After the expel operation the checkpoint appears as follows.

           new   low     high
          dummy seqno   seqno
            |      |      |
            |      |      |
           \./    \./    \./
         ---------------------
          1000 | 1005 | 1006 |
         ---------------------
           /.\           /.\
            |             |
            |             |
         cursor 1      cursor 2

The number of items in the checkpoint remains unchanged after expelling
i.e. in the above example the checkpoint remains:

        -------------------------------------------
        | 1001 | 1002 | 1003 | 1004 | 1005 | 1006 |
        -------------------------------------------
                                /.\           /.\
                                 |             |
                                 |             |
                              cursor 1      cursor 2

If a checkpoint contains a single mutation then it is not expelled.
Also if the cursor is pointing to a meta-item the position to expel
from is moved backwards until either a mutation item or the dummy item
is reached.

The ability to expel items is controlled by a configuration parameter
"chk_expel_enabled".  The parameter is defaulted to true, however is
dynamic so can be disabled at runtime if required.
