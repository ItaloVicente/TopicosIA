DESCRIPTION:

MB-32591: Expel checkpoint items that are no longer required

This patch introduces the ability to expel items from the oldest
checkpoint that still has cursors in it.  This can include the open
checkpoint.

Items are expelled items from checkpoints to reduce memory requirements.
This is achieved by identifying the oldest checkpoint that has cursors
still in it.  Then identifying where the first cursor is located. For
example in the diagram below it is seqno 1004.

                  low                                high
           dummy seqno                              seqno
             |     |                                  |
             |     |                                  |
            \./   \./                                \./
         --------------------------------------------------
         | 1000 | 1001 | 1002 | 1003 | 1004 | 1005 | 1006 |
         --------------------------------------------------
                                       /.\           /.\
                                        |             |
                                        |             |
                                     cursor 1      cursor 2

It then expels items from the start of the checkpoint upto and including
where the first cursor is located.  In the diagram this means expelling
1000, 1001, 1002, 1003 and 1004. A new dummy is created at the position
of where the last cursor pointed and is assigned the same seqno as the
previous dummy.

After the expel operation the checkpoint in memory is follows.

           new   low     high
          dummy seqno   seqno
            |      |      |
            |      |      |
           \./    \./    \./
         ---------------------
          1000 | 1005 | 1006 |
         ---------------------
           /.\           /.\
            |             |
            |             |
         cursor 1      cursor 2

The number of items in the checkpoint remains unchanged after expelling
i.e. in the above example the full checkpoint remains:

        -------------------------------------------
        | 1001 | 1002 | 1003 | 1004 | 1005 | 1006 |
        -------------------------------------------
                                /.\           /.\
                                 |             |
                                 |             |
                              cursor 1      cursor 2

If a checkpoint contains a single mutation then it is not expelled.
Also if the cursor is pointing to a meta-item the position to expel
from is moved backwards until either a mutation item or the dummy item
is reached.

The ability to expel items is controlled by a configuration parameter
"chk_expel_enabled".  The parameter is defaulted to true, however is
dynamic so can be disabled at runtime if required.

Line:157, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Why the need for the cast? can we not use the correct type (int64_t) for highestExpelledSeqno in the first place?

Line:331, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> This seems a little pointless - why don't you just skip expelling the original dummy item?

Line:305, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Might be worth clarifying while it's physically up to the cursor position, logically it's really one before (given how we implement cursors to happen to point to the item already processed).

Line:334, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> This wasn't clear to me - are you saying we still report that the checkout has 6 items in it?

Line:538, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Can this be montonic or similar (it shouldn't go backwards, right?)

Line:489, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Perf: you possibly have unnecessary copies happening here - typically Type1 and Type2 could be const& (see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/accumulate).

Line:489, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> The checkpoint we are searching for is constant - you don't need to pass it around in each function call, just capture it in your lambda function.

Line:490, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Prefer `const cursor_index::value_type&` -  that is:

a) Shorter
b) derived from the underlying container type - so if the container changes then it's automatically still work here
c) More obvious (IMHO) to the reader exactly what we are walking across.

Line:503, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Pretty sure you can remove this case from the search if you instead just pass the first cursor to std::accumuate's `init` value (you can then also start accumulating from the element after begin()).

Line:517, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Style: the deep nesting makes this hard to follow. Can I suggest you utilise earlier returns to (a) reduce the scope the reader has to read and reduce nesting - i.e.

 auto checkpoint = ...;
 if (current.second != checkpoint) {
     return current;
 }
 ...

Line:546, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Please explain why this is the case.

Line:157, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> We seem to swap between int64_t and uint64_t for seqno.

For example getLowSeqno / getHighSeqno etc. return uint64_t however 
mutation_id is int64_t.  Given that an item's bySeqno is int64_t will use that for highestSeqno.

Line:331, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Done

Line:305, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Done

Line:334, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> yes - have clarified in comment.

Line:538, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> correct - made monotonic
