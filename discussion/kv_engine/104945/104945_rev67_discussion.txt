DESCRIPTION:

MB-32591: Expel checkpoint items that are no longer required

This patch introduces the ability to expel items from the oldest
checkpoint that still has cursors in it.  This can include the open
checkpoint.

The reason for expelling items is to reduce the size of checkpoints.
It achieves this by identifying the oldest checkpoint that has cursors
still in it.  Then identify where the first cursor is located. For
example in the diagram below it is seqno 1004.

                  low                                high
           dummy seqno                              seqno
             |     |                                  |
             |     |                                  |
            \./   \./                                \./
         --------------------------------------------------
         | 1000 | 1001 | 1002 | 1003 | 1004 | 1005 | 1006 |
         --------------------------------------------------
                                       /.\           /.\
                                        |             |
                                        |             |
                                     cursor 1      cursor 2

It then expels items from the start of the checkpoint (ejects from
memory) up to where the first cursor is located.  In the diagram this
means expelling 1000, 1001, 1002 and 1003.  The item at seqno 1004
becomes the new dummy item.

After the expel operation the checkpoint appears as follows.

                 low     high
           dummy seqno   seqno
            |      |      |
            |      |      |
           \./    \./    \./
         ---------------------
          1004 | 1005 | 1006 |
         ---------------------
           /.\           /.\
            |             |
            |             |
         cursor 1      cursor 2
