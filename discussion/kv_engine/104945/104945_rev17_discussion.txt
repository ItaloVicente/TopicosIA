DESCRIPTION:

MB-32591: Expel checkpoint items that are no longer required

With the introduction of
Change-Id: Ib68eedf3be064a5e6cc63cf7eaa2f8516c9de3dc
(see http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/104658/) we are able to expel
items from the checkpoint queue.  When an item is expelled we reset the
queue's pointer to the item.  As we now skip passed null pointers
when iterating over the checkpoint queue it means these items are
ignored.

This patch now uses this ability to reduce the size of checkpoints.  It
achieves this by identifying the oldest checkpoint that has cursors
still in it.  Then identifying the highest seqno before a cursor is
encountered.  For example in the diagram below it is seqno 1003.

                            highest seqno
         low seqno         before a cursor        high seqno
             |                   |                    |
             |                   |                    |
            \./                 \./                   \./
         --------------------------------------------------
         | 1000 | 1001 | 1002 | 1003 | 1004 | 1005 | 1006 |
         --------------------------------------------------
                                       /.\           /.\
                                        |             |
                                        |             |
                                     cursor 1      cursor 2

It then expels items from the start of the checkpoint.  For example in
the diagram this means expelling 1000, 1001, 1002 and 1003.  Although
the size of the checkpoint does not change it means the expelled items
can be freed from memory.
