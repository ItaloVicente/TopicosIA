DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Use cb::mcbp::Status in DCP interface

The status code passed in the DCP interface was put
directly into the status field in the response message
and passed along as uint8_t. We have an enum class
representing all of the valid response codes and getter/
setter methods in the response class to perform the
correct byteswapping.
