MB-26047:[4] Migrate away from using gethrtime() (ep)

Replace uses of gethrtime() with ProcessClock::now() and refactor
related code to use typesafe <chrono> time units.

I think we can also improve things so the Histogram of durations is type-safe - i.e. we store a chrono::duration and remove all the manual microseconds conversions.

I've got a patch I've thrown together which does most of this - but needs testing. Give me 10mins and I'll send you a link.
Line:231, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> Might be worth expanding this to document what the unit is - it looks like it's mostly microsecond, but is it sometimes milliseconds?

Line:2518, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Prefer to keep in chrono units - i.e. change getCheckpointFlushTimeout() to return chrono::seconds.

Line:1351, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Style: This is probably a reasonable place to add `using namespace std::chrono`; simplifying your various uses of chrono here.

Line:137, engines/ep/src/warmup.h -> Style: Don't need `void` in C++ for functions taking zero arguments.

Line:223, engines/ep/src/warmup.h -> This appears to be a time point; not a duration; so suggest using ProcessClock::time_point. For the atomicity; this is only updated maybe once (start of warmup), so you can just add a simple std::mutex and use it to guard all of these.

One suggestion to make the scope of the mutex clear - put it in it's own mini struct:

 /// Times when the various warmup stages occurred.
 /// All are guarded by the same mutex.
 struct {
     std::mutex mutex;
     ProcessClock::time_point start;
     ProcessClock::time_point metadata;
     ProcessClock::time_point warmup;
 } timings;
