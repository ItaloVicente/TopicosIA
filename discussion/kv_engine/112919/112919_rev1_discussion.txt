DESCRIPTION:

MB-35427: Remove ack for correct consumer

When we set the ActiveStream to dead we attempt to remove any
queuedSeqnoAck from the DM's map. We currently attempt to remove
the ack with the name of the ActiveStream which is not correct. We
should instead remove the ack with the name of the consumer which is
stored in the DcpProducer.

Line:1208, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Note for follow-up / future change - make supportsSyncReplication() only be true if the consumer actually set a consumer_name (then we can remove this check - or at least turn it into an assert).

Line:52, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Nit: the consumer_name should really be along the lines of "test_consumer" to match what ns_server does (only overall Stream::name should be test_producer->test_consumer).

Line:1208, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> might actually want to do the opposite and make this silent. We allow supportsSyncRepl without a consumer name (the state is copied from producer) so that somebody could in the future "subscribe" to prepares and commits instead of mutations

Line:1208, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> True, however that's not fully-formed in the handling ;)

I think we _do_ need to eventually distinguish between:

a) Supports "DCP_PREPARE / DCP_COMMIT" - and wants to see those messages (e.g. future SyncWrite-supporting GSI), but isn't a replica and hence shouldn't seqno_ack, and

b) Full SyncReplication supporting replica which accepts DCP_PREPARE/DCP_COMMIT and responds with DCP_SEQNO_ACK. Currently just KV-Engine, but maybe in future might also be XDCR?

IMHO at the moment "supportsSyncReplication" encompasses (b), in future we might have supportsSyncWrites which would be (a).

Either way, I don't expect Mad-Hatter (Producer) to handle anything other than case (b).
