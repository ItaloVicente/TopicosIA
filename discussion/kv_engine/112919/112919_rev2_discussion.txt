DESCRIPTION:

MB-35427: Remove ack for correct consumer

When we set the ActiveStream to dead we attempt to remove any
queuedSeqnoAck from the DM's map. We currently attempt to remove
the ack with the name of the ActiveStream which is not correct. We
should instead remove the ack with the name of the consumer which is
stored in the DcpProducer.

Line:1431, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> No, this one _should_ be "test_producer->test_consumer" - we want two different strings to make sure we test correctly.
