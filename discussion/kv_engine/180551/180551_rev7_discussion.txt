DESCRIPTION:

MB-53806: AS::backfillReceived yields after processing the item

Before this change callbacks yield *before* processing the item.

Patch https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/179955 erroneously
modified the KVStore(s) code assuming the opposite (ie, that yielding
is triggered after processing the item).

The consequence is that at backfill we set (lastReadSeqno = item's
seqno) while the item isn't pushed over DCP. Menaing that we
effectively skip the item at backfill resumed, as the backfill will
resume at lastReadSeqno + 1.
The same applies to both BySeqno and ById scans.

The patch fixes the issue by making the origianl assumption true. Ie,
with this change all the backfill callbacks yield after processing the
item.

Note that https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/179955 already
made warmup callbacks behaving the same. So this patch normilizes the
behaviour across all backfill/warmup callbacks.
