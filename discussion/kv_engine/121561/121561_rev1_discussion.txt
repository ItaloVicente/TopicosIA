DESCRIPTION:

MB-37772: Change SystemEvent key format

Changing the format from:

    [0x1][collection_:][0xcollection id]

    - [0x1] is the 'system' namespace
    - [collection_:] is a string representing the event type, we also
      have [scope_:].
    - [0xcollection id] is the leb128 encoded collection-ID

to:

    [0x1][0xType][0xcollection id][collection_]

    - [0x1] is the 'system' namespace
    - [0xType] is the type of the event, scope or collection
    - [0xcollection id] is the leb128 encoded collection-ID (or scope)
    - [collection_] is now just to aid debugging

Overall this is easier to manage using the leb128 'streaming' prefix,
where you can have many prefixes ahead of some 'data' and it is quite
easy to iterate through with the leb128 api.

This also brings a hierarchy to the system event key, a 'path' e.g.:

  /system/scopes/<id>/
  /system/collection/<id>/

The motivation for the re-structure is that it could be used by OSO
backfill, in the future we could DCP 'dump' all collection meta data in
OSO, by forming a range scan which will just 'iterate' within the
/system/collections/<id> part of the by-name index.
