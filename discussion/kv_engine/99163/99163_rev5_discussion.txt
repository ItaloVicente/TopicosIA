needing to restart DCP connections.

Line:1219, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> FYI, I think this change /could/ have a negative performance impact. 

We call maybeDisconnect() every time a DCP stream attempts to advance its state (DcpProducer::step) - i.e. very frequently - and calling methods on getConfiguration() can be relatively slow (as they need to acquire a lock on the Configuration object).

As such, in large-scale deployments this change could end up slowing down DCP production (as multiple different DCP producers will now be serialised).

From the MB the first build containing this patch is 6.5.0-1286. I'm not seeing anything in the recent showfast[1] runs so it looks like we might be ok, but I'll keep an eye out...
