DESCRIPTION:

MB-38272: Share flusher batch limit by writers, not shards

Currently we are sharing the total flusher batch limit across all
shards. This is problematic for our default configuration though which
has 1 shard per core and 4 writer threads as it over-limits the amount
that a single thread can flush when we have more than 4 cores. It also
makes the flusher_total_batch_limit configuration parameter difficult
to use as it requires knowledge of both shards and writers to calcualte.

Split the flusher_total_batch_limit by writers instead of shards so that
we don't negatively affect the default configuration and make
calculating the per flush limit and max concurrent limit easier.

Line:91, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_bucket.h -> I think it would be better to only have this in the ep subclass, and then in the listener just call the method if the bucket is ep (or add a per-ep listener).

Additionally this config param shouldn't be enabled for ephemeral anyway.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:91, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_bucket.h -> Wanted to add a per-ep limit but then EPBucket needs to know about Configuration (or the overall limit of flusher_total_batch_limit) to do it in a listener. Just called this only for EPBucket.
