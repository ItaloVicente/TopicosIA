DESCRIPTION:

MB-32181: Wake up EphTombstoneStaleItemDeleter correctly

The EphTombstoneStaleItemDeleter task is supposed to be woken up and
scheduled once the paired EphTombstoneHTCleaner task
completes. However, due to a mis-use of the GlobalTask::wakeUp()
function the task was not actually scheduled - only it's desired
wakeupTime was updated.

This manifested in the logs as a super-slow scheduling time - e.g.

    2018-11-29T13:55:18.566925Z WARNING (ephemeral-1) Slow scheduling for NON_IO task 'Eph tombstone stale item deleter' on thread nonIO_worker_1. Schedule overhead: 10 s

An immediate consequence is the task wasn't run when desired. However,
it also had a knock-on effect of breaking the ordering of the
futureQueue (a std::priority_queue); as that uses the wakeTime as the
ordering property.

Because the expected invariants of the futureQueue have been broken,
the ordering of Tasks in the FutureQueue is also broken (as we use
std::push_heap to add elements which assumes the queue is correctly
sorted). As a result, *other nonIO tasks* can fail to be scheduled at
the desired time.

This includes the DCP connection notifier which is responsible for
checking if DCP no-op timeouts have been exceeded, and can cause DCP
connections to be incorrectly considered to have exceeded the no-op
interval and hence disconnected - for example:

    2018-11-29T15:03:13.029478Z INFO (ephemeral-4) DCP (Consumer) eq_dcpq:replication:ns_1@data-1->ns_1@data-2:ephemeral-4 - Disconnecting because a message has not been received for 360s. lastMessageTime:361
    2018-11-29T15:03:13.032533Z WARNING (ephemeral-6) Slow scheduling for NON_IO task 'DCP connection notifier' on thread nonIO_worker_1. Schedule overhead: 554 s

Fix is to use the correct method (ExecutorPool::wake) to wake the
task; which updates the wakeTime *and* the potition in the
futureQueue.
