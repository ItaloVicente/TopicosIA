DESCRIPTION:

MB-51805: Set PassiveStream::cur_snapshot_prepare on new stream

We use the cur_snapshot_prepare member to determine if we should
notify the PDM of any Memory snapshots. It is set when we see a
prepare in any snapshot. Consider the following snapshot:

[1:Prepare(A), 2:Mutation(B)] Type = Memory

If we have only received the following sequence of events but then
restart, we would fail to notify the PDM of the complete snapshot:

1) SnapshotMarker (1-2) Type = Memory
2) Prepare (1)

To solve this, we can fix the cur_snapshot_prepare state on
PassiveStream acceptance. This should only happen if we are mid-snapshot
so check if the highest thing (prepare) tracked by the DM is greater than
the snapshot start to determine if we are mid-snapshot (and that there
is a prepare that we must notify the PDM about).
