DESCRIPTION:

MB-30019: Optimize and test CheckpointManager::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint

Currently the function is suboptimal and executes many unnecessary steps
(many of them are legacy from TAP).
This change removes the dead code and adds tests.

Line:1172, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Never executed as we used to call this function passing in input (openCheckpointId + 1)

Line:1180, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I think that we should just close the backfill-checkpoint and create a new one (that could be potentially big)

Line:1189, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> This is the code responsible for the regression at MB-30234.
By closing the open checkpoint at snapshotEnd, we may end up with a lot of checkpoints (thousands).
Again, this is useless as we always create a new checkpoint with id = prevId + 1, so the else block at line 1220 below is never executed.

Line:1196, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> id = prevId + 1, never executed

Line:1216, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> This seems to be legacy code from TAP.
If the current checkpoint is open and empty (which I don't think can really happen at this point, as we are processing a snapshotEnd mutation, so there should be at least 1 item in the checkpoint), then just don't do anything.

Line:1180, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Error: there is no backfill-checkpoint, as backfill mutations are enqueued into a dedicated backfill-queue.
