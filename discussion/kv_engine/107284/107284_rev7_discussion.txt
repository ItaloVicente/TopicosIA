DESCRIPTION:

MB-22005: Move from Histogram<T> to data size HdrHistograms

Replace the usages of the template class Histogram<T> from
platform/histogram.h with specialised versions of HdrHistogram.
This will allow us to display data with dynamic bucketing
what can be based on percentiles or a logarithmic scale. Unlike
Histogram<T> which uses fixed width buckets. Which makes it hard
to view if all the values fall into the same bucket. With
HdrHistogram we can display the information around the data,
making it easier to understand.

Refactor HdrMicroSecHistogram, to reduce it's memory foot print
by reducing its accuracy from 3 sig fig to 2 sig fig. Also we've
renamed it to Hdr2sfMicroSecHistogram, to help reflect this.

Add code to get the memory foot print of stacutes that use
HdrHistograms. As just using sizeof(struct x) will not give an
accuracy value as HdrHistograms are allocated to the heap.

I think we still need some more details on what the change in overall memory footprint is with the HdrHistograms - i.e. ensure mem_used is correctly tracking them and see the before / after for say a 100MB bucket.
Line:22, /COMMIT_MSG -> structures ?

Line:47, daemon/protocol/mcbp/get_cmd_timer_executor.cc -> Style: You should be able to simplify this to:

 return {ENGINE_EACCESS, {}};

(e.g. https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/yQZN3n)

Reduces the amount of boilerplate required.

Line:363, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> Nit: If you change this again, suggest capitalising the 'i' in int so it matches the coding standard & is easier to read:

 Hdr2sfInt32Histogram

Line:401, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> Might not even need 2 significant figures here. What are the relative sizes of the 2 and 1 sf Histograms? Could you include the relevant output from ep_engine_sizes in the commit message?

Line:494, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> Suspect these could get large, given we have about ~30 task types. How do they look with just 1 sf?

Line:494, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> 1 sf doesn't look two dissimilar to the output of the 1sf so we'll go with 1sf for now? I've got output of both if you want to see them.
