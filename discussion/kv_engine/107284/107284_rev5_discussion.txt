DESCRIPTION:

MB-22005: Move from Histogram<T> to data size HdrHistograms

Replace the usages of the template class Histogram<T> from
platform/histogram.h with specialised versions of HdrHistogram.
This will allow us to display data with dynamic bucketing
what can be based on percentiles or a logarithmic scale. Unlike
Histogram<T> which uses fixed width buckets. Which makes it hard
to view if all the values fall into the same bucket. With
HdrHistogram we can display the information around the data,
making it easier to understand.

Still a working progress, just pushed to check CV and to gain some feed back. State of the patch is hacky and need tidying
