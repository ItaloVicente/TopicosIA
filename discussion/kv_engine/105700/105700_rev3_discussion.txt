Line:3, engines/ep/management/CMakeLists.txt -> Nit: PROJECT_BINARY_DIR (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/PROJECT_BINARY_DIR.html) avoids the need for the relative path stuff.

Line:3, engines/ep/management/CMakeLists.txt -> Not in this case - kv_engine/engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt has a PROJECT() declaration, which means I'd still need ../.. . In general I find PROJECT_BINARY_DIR a mixed blessing since its meaning can be modified by unrelated changes like someone adding a PROJECT() declaration in your directory hierarchy.

As an aside, I'm not sure how to handle the CV failures here. It appears these jobs can't handle a change-id with a large number of related changes; at least the one I looked at seemed to be choking applying the ns_server patch.

So the KV-Engine commit-validation jobs don't normally checkout ns_server - that's probably the problem.

I think your options are:

(a) unlink ns_server - assuming ns_server themselves don't do linked checkouts, KV-Engine isn't actually going to test those changes anyway so there's no actual value in linking them.

(b) Update the build scripts to ignored linked projects which arn't currently checked out. 

b) is probably the more "correct" solution but requires changes to the build scripts...
