DESCRIPTION:

MB-53198: Do not abort warmup for shard if scan cancelled

Scan cancellation is a valid scenario if a vBucket goes away during
the warmup of it. Currently the warmup code treats scan cancellation
as a failure which aborts the warmup of the rest of the shard. Instead,
we should just move on to the next vBucket.
