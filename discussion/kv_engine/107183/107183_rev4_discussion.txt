DESCRIPTION:

MB-33389: KVStore: Unify JSON representation of vbucket_state

The vbucket_state class has three different JSON serialization methods
- vbucket_state::toJSON, and then one method in each of CouchKVStore
and RocksDBKVStore.

Additionally, it also has two different deserialization methods in
CouchKVStore and RockDBKVStore.

However, they (should) all be equivalent. Remove the duplication and
avoid any errors when adding future fields by unifying them; using
nlohmann::json's built-in serialization and deserialization support.

Note: This patch takes the opportunity to simplify the handling of a
    number of vbucket_state fields which were not part of the original
    struct and were added over time. Previously these were permitted
    to not exist (i.e. if the couchstore file was from an offline
    upgrade from a version which didn't support the field).

    However for v6.0.0 we only support upgrade (offline or online)
    from v5.0.0 or later - therefore all fields which are supported
    (written) by 5.0.0 can be assumed to exist; simplifying a bunch of
    the parsing logic.
