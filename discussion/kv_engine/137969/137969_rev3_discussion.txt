Line:1110, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> I knoww this is consistent with how it was before, but just OOI is there a specific reason it's "vb_X_{cid}:key" here vs other places where it's "vb_X:{cid}:key" (e.g., ManifestEntry::addStats)?

Line:1128, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Nit, looks like this is the only value that can be returned now, could make the return type void.

Line:43, utilities/dockey.cc -> I'm not sure if it is of any benefit, but with

 #include <spdlog/fmt/ostr.h>

you can do

 fmt::print(os, "{:#x}", uint32_t(sid));

but given streams are still definitely involved I'm not sure if this brings any perf benefit.

One possible non-perf benefit is that it avoids IO manipulators - using std::hex will affect anything that streamed to the same stream after, which could lead to subtle bugs elsewhere if it is assumed the stream will format as decimal - "stat prints correctly until we add a scope, then it is hex instead" kinda thing. :shrug:

There's other ways of restoring flags without fliping to fmt, like manually saving and setting them, boost::io::ios_flags_saver and so on.

Not sure if it is a big concern given our typical straightforward use of streams, but thought I'd mention it :)

Line:108, utilities/test_manifest.cc -> think its oddity of our clang-format job that it probably will pass this because lines 107 & 108 are not part of the patch but the indentation has been effected due the scope being removed.
