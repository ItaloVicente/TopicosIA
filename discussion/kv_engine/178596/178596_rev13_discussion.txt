DESCRIPTION:

MB-52311: [1/n] Pause / Resume Bucket: opcodes

Add new PauseBucket (0x8a) and ResumeBucket (0x8b) opcodes, allow
server to decode them and client_connection to send them.

Add PauseResumeTest suite plus a basic sanity test - initially
disabled as opcodes are not implemented yet - they can be issued but
currently do nothing.
