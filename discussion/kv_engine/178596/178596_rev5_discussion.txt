DESCRIPTION:

MB-52311: [1/n] Pause / Unpause Bucket: opcodes

Add new PauseBucket (0x8a) and UnpauseBucket (0x8b) opcodes, allow
server to decode them and client_connection to send them.

Add PauseResumeTest suite plus a basic sanity test. Note opcodes are
not implemented yet - they can be issued but currently do nothing.
