DESCRIPTION:

Revert "MB-36578: [BP] Dereference cookie when creating DCP conn with same name"

This reverts commit 5b0a350fc4963ab5d727e03f910e73be77e29da9.

After further investigation it was determined that the issue (MB-36451)
of not dereferencing the cookie of DCP connections can be a symptom of
MB-31495 and the code appears to be correct. As such, this change is
unnecessary.
