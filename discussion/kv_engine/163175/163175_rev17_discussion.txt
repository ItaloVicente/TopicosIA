DESCRIPTION:

MB-47566: Ensure compaction doesn't cause a underflow exception

Currently an implicit compaction of a MamaKVStore can run concurrently
while VBucket's are being re-set during in memory. This can be
triggered due to a replica VBucket being rolled back to seqno:0. This
can cause an underflow of the item stats during the compaction
completion callback, the callback gets hold of the VBucket pointer to
the current VBucket in memory. The problem is that this points to the
new VBucket at seqno:0. So when we subtract the dropped items it
causes a subtraction against 0.

To fix this the CompactionContext should store a shared pointer to the
VBucket it's compacting for instead of just the VBid. So that we
correctly modify the in memory values of the VBucket revision we're
compacting for.

Line:1221, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> why can't we just do vb->getId() rather than a lambda (the lambda is suggesting some complexity which isn't clear why)?

... reading further along and is this just for unit tests that don't create a VBucket object? It could be simpler to just have a VBid parameter and comments as to why it exists (needed for cases when VBucket is null)

Line:1229, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> similar here - no need to copy the shared_ptr, can pass the VBucket reference (*ctx->vbPtr)

Line:1257, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> no need to copy the shared_ptr here, just read out the VBucket 

auto& vb = *ctx.vb;

Line:341, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.h -> pass a VBucket reference here - we don't need to pass the shared_ptr

Looks like I'm playing snap with Jim ;)
Line:1169, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Unless you actually need to share ownership of the vbucket with anyone else (i.e. the vb is copied / passed to some background task here), prefer just passing a VBucket&. The caller of this function is the one who is responsible for the VBucket ownership.

Line:1229, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Might be worth thinking about what we want to happen to a running compaction if a VBucket is deleted. By handing out shared ptrs to VBucket, you essentially keep that VBucket object alive for an extended period - until compaction has finished (or more explicitly until the various contexts here are deleted).

Given compaction _can_ take many seconds or even minutes, is that desirable?  If there isn't already some other cancellation method for compaction when a vBucket is deleted, I would suggest passing a weak_ptr into these various background contexts; if they fail to promote to a strong (shared) ptr, then compaction can be cancelled on that file etc.

Line:240, engines/ep/src/kvstore/kvstore.h -> This seems a bit complex - what's the reason for it - can a caller not just ask for the vbucket id from the VBucketPtr?

Or even just have a const vbid member which is initialised in the constructor - I assume the VBucket for compactions cannot change while compaction is running?

Line:619, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/magma_bucket_tests.cc -> Do you need threads here? Could you not directly trigger compaction from within the completionCallback?
