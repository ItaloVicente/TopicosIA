DESCRIPTION:

MB-47566: Ensure compaction doesn't cause a underflow exception

Currently an implicit compaction of a MamaKVStore can run concurrently
while VBucket's are being re-set during in memory. This can be
triggered due to a replica VBucket being rolled back to seqno:0. This
can cause an underflow of the item stats during the compaction
completion callback, the callback gets hold of the VBucket pointer to
the current VBucket in memory. The problem is that this points to the
new VBucket at seqno:0. So when we subtract the dropped items it
causes a subtraction against 0.

To fix this the CompactionContext should store a weak pointer to the
VBucket it's compacting for instead of just the VBid. So that we
correctly modify the in memory values of the VBucket revision we're
compacting for, by promoting the weak pointer to a shared pointer when
we need to access the VBucket.

Line:1243, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> I assume throwing with cancel compaction here?

Line:241, engines/ep/src/kvstore/kvstore.h -> Suggest documenting these two members.

Line:2126, engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Similar to others uses, should we not be passing in a shared (weak) ptr here, given we only want this compaction to run against the particular instance of this vb which existed at the start of the compaction?

Line:1243, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Indeed it will be caught by EPBucket::compactInternal() which has been called by EPBucket::doCompact().
