DESCRIPTION:

MB-39815: Tighten argument checks in PDM::addSyncWrite

SyncWrites added to the PassiveDM should always have an infinite
timeout; given it's not legal for a non-active vBucket to timeout (and
abort) a SyncWrite. Add an extra check for this, and fix a test which
incorrectly did specify a timeout.
