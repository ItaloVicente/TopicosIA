Refactor input packet handling..

Rename bin_read_chunk to resize_input_buffer and bypass
going to conn_read_packet_body if the entire body is available
after looking at the packet header.

Line:137, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> Note: This is potentially more expensive compared to realloc - jemalloc can perform a "free" realloc if the current and requested size fall within the same size class (see http://jemalloc.net/jemalloc.3.html#size_classes), but with your change to malloc / free you'll prevent that optimisation; and moreover will always have to do the std::copy().

Line:137, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> From the link we'll always switch classes as we we start off with 2k, then go to 4, then 8, 16 etc... 

Anyway, this function will go away in the one of the following commits as we'll be dropping this buffer and use the pipe...

Line:137, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> looks like I read that page wrong with the quick look I took at it.. anyway we need to rather do realloc in cb::Pipe as there is where the buffer is going to end up after all of the refactoring..

Line:137, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> Actually, I should probably add that once you're into Large size classes (i.e. page-aligned) you /can/ expand into larger classes if the adjacent virtual page is free.

While you may be getting rid of it soon, given the issues we had tracking down the cause of the regression previously, I'd be keen to try to minimise / avoid any change in intermediate patches (such as this) which could impact performance - it just makes it so much harder to identify exactly when a problem is introduced. It looks like it should be simple to keep the old logic on using realloc() here.

Line:137, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> (that being said, in the perf stuff we ran earlier it would never realloc here as all operations would fit into the same page size. I'll revert this to realloc and make sure we use realloc in cb::Pipe).

In the case where it _would_ allocate a new segment (and not grow the current one) this could probably be faster as it only copies the subset of data in use instead of the entire memory segment.
