Patch Set 8:

(5 comments)
Line:35, engines/ep/src/collections/flush.cc -> Given committedHighSeqno and preparedSeqno seem mutually exclusive when creating StatisticsUpdate, prefer to express that in the API - i.e. make the StatisticsUpdate ctor only take one seqno and a flag if that's committed or prepared.

That reduces the likelihood of incorrectly using the class.

Line:39, engines/ep/src/collections/flush.cc -> Similary here - if we only expect one of the two to be updated for a given update, change the API to express that - have maybeSet...() take a single seqno and flag.

Line:2049, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_test.cc -> Suggest documenting why magma is different here.

Line:2080, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_test.cc -> Ditto. Maybe also abstract this repeated code - have a helper function which returns the function to use for a given backend.

Line:2101, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_test.cc -> Suggest abstracting this repeated code - have a helper function which returns the function to use for a given backend. That would also help making the code self-documenting given you're naming the function based on what it does.
