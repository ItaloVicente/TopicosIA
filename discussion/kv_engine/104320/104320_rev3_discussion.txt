DESCRIPTION:

MB-32577 Fix crash during rebalance by block DCP during warmup

Fix crash during rebalance (MB-32577), caused by us allowing DCP
consumer connections during warmup. To fix this we now return
ENGINE_TMPFAIL till we have fully warmedup. This commit also
adds a unit test to check that we block DCP during warmup and
that once fully warmed up we can correctly send delete requests
to a DCP consumer.

Update stream-request.mb documentation to explain when
PROTOCOL_BINARY_RESPONSE_ETEMPFAIL (0x86) is returned.

Update ep_engine.cc to have more info logging about when
traffic is enabled to ep-engine.

This is a re-commit of 65b6b96227725d512511372e661a842f95e43e75
which was revered by 842e955befd68fc864d0082a09dc258866b318bf.
As it had a bug that meant EPEngine::dcpOpen would never create
a new consumer as it was waiting for traffic to be enabled which
happens after EPEngine::dcpOpen is called.

One other thing - have you checked the original bug scenario and that ns_server correctly handles things when we send it an ETMPFAIL response?
Line:5652, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> If you're going to add a log message here, suggest including additional request details (seqno, flags).

Also I think the "as EPEngine warmed-up" part is a bit unnecessary - that's the common case and it's implicit (if you don't see a ETMPFAIL message).
