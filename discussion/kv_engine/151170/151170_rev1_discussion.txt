DESCRIPTION:

Fix mctiming's --json=pretty flag

Currently mctiming's doesn't respect the pretty arg to --json and
instead produces json in pretty format at all times. To fix this only
dump() json with indentation when the pretty flag has be set. Also
ensure we don't print the histogram legend when the pretty is set.
