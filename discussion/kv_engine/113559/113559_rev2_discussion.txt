DESCRIPTION:

MB-35539: Check cas of committed item when creating new prepare

Transactions identified that we were not checking the cas of the
committed item when attempting to add a new prepare. This was
causing us to lose subdoc operations. Refactor the code to hit all
of the normal checks made in VBucket::processSetInner when attempting
to add a new prepare.
