DESCRIPTION:

MB-33081: Don't re-schedule VBCBAdapter once per vBucket

VBCBAdapter is a Task which invokes a visitor object on each vBucket
in a Bucket. Recently the DurabilityMonitorTimeout task was added
which uses the VBCBAdapter to visit each vBucket and check for
timed-out SyncWrites. The DurabilityMonitorTimeout task is scheduled
to run every 25ms on each Bucket.

However, this has exposed an ineffiency in the VBCBAdapter -
specifically that it only processes one vBucket on each call to
run(). This means that a single-node cluster will need to schedule the
VBCBAdapter task 1024 times for each Bucket - every 24us in the case
of the timeout task. Our current ExecutorPool / TaskQueue doesn't
handle this frequency of schedling very well - a single-node cluster
with 2 (empty) buckets results in idle CPU usage of 150% - essentially
all that time is being spent re-scheduling the VBCBAdapter 1024 times,
once for each vBucket.

Address this by changing VBCBAdapter::run to process (up to) all
vBuckets in each call - only if the visitor returns true from
pauseVisitor() does VBCBAdapter::run() pause itself and allow other
tasks to run.

This change potentially introduces a regression in the opposite
direction - if VBCBAdapter::run() no longer yields between vBuckets
then slow-running visitors could cause delays in other background
tasks running. To attempt to avoid this, restructure
KVBucketIface::visitAsync():

1. Add a new PausableVBucketVisitor base class, and change
   KVBucketIface::visitAsync() to accept an instance of this
   class. This tightens up the API for (async) visiting, making it
   explicit that visitors are pausable.

2. Add a CappedDurationVBucketVisitor subclass of
   PausableVBucketVisitor. This class imposes a cap (currently 25ms)
   on the amount of time it will run for before it pauses and allows
   other tasks to be scheduled.

3. Update all existing visitors to derive from
   CappedDurationVBucketVisitor if they don't already implement
   pauseVisitor().

After this change the same test results in ~5% idle CPU usage.
