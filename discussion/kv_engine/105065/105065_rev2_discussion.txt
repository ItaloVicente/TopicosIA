DESCRIPTION:

MB-33081: Don't re-schedule VBCBAdapter once per vBucket

VBCBAdapter is a Task which invokes a visitor object on each vBucket
in a Bucket. Recently the DurabilityMonitorTimeout task was added
which uses the VBCBAdapter to visit each vBucket and check for timed
out SyncWrites. The DurabilityMonitorTimeout task is scheduled to run
every 25ms on each Bucket.

However, this has exposed an ineffiency in the VBCBAdapter -
specifically that it only processes one vBucket on each call to
run(). This means that a single-node cluster will need to schedule the
VBCBAdapter task 1024 times for each Bucket - every 24us in the case
of the timeout task. Our current ExecutorPool / TaskQueue doesn't
handle this frequency of schedling very well - a single-node cluster
with 2 (empty) buckets results in idle CPU usage of 150% - essentially
all that time is being spent re-scheduling the VBCBAdapter 1024 times,
once for each vBucket.

Address this by changeing VBCBAdapter::run to process (up to) all
vBuckets in each call - only if the visitor returns true from
pauseVisitor() does VBCBAdapter::run() pause itself and allow other
tasks to run.

This change potentially introduces a regression in the opposite
direction - if VBCBAdapter::run() no longer yields between vBuckets
then slow-running visitors could cause delays in other background
tasks running. To attempt to avoid this, modify VBucketVisitor to
provide a default implementation for pauseVisitor() - it will pause
when the visitor has run for more than maxChunkDuration. This defaults
to defaults to 25ms, but visitors can override this (or provide a more
elaborate pauseVisitor() implementation) if required.

After this change the same test results in ~5% idle CPU usage.
