DESCRIPTION:

MB-25601: Testapp: Restore subdoc tests

The subdoc single and multipath tests were accidently disabled during
a previous refactor (facc775).

This occured because the single and multipath tests are parameterised;
and need an instantantion (via INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P) to specify
exactly what parameters they should be run under. During the refactor,
the subdoc tests (in testapp_subdoc.cc) were no longer built into a
binary which had a INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P instance for the
suite. Prior to the refactor it came from testapp.cc but this code was
moved to testapp_legacy_{plain,ssl}.cc which isn't built with
testapp_subdoc.cc.

Fix this by adding a suitable INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P() invocation to
testapp_subdoc.cc & testapp_subdoc_multipath.cc.

So we don't run the subdoc tests twice (in memcached-subdoc-perf-tests
& memcached-subdoc-multipath-tests), and so we don't also re-run all
the non-subdoc tests (which reside in testapp_subdoc.cc) move the
common subdoc code those two suites rely on into
testapp_subdoc_common.cc, and all common non-subdoc code in
testapp_tests.cc to testapp.cc
