DESCRIPTION:

Call new/delete hooks from dummy_alloc hooks

When running with the system memory allocator (typically only for
certain test configurations such as AddressSanitizer) we currently
don't perform any memory allocation tracking. This is because
historically we relied on specific memory allocator library
funcationality.

However, since introducing our explicit cb_malloc() library this is no
longer the case; the memory tracking is actually done by cb_malloc and
the AllowHooks just chain down to that. As such, it is simple to add
memory tracking support to dummy_alloc_hooks.
