DESCRIPTION:

MB-45026: Expelling doesn't remove the checkpoint_start item

A good amount of logic around checkpoint assumes the invariant that
the checkpoint_start item always exists in Checkpoint, same as the
empty-item.

When we implemented item-expel we broke that invariant. Expel may remove
the checkpoint_start item because it always assumes that it has to
remove all items that share the same seqno.
We still keep that logic at "expel", but not for the checkpoint_start
item that stays untouched now.

The change requires to preserve our cursor-registering logic by updating
the Checkpoint::getLowSeqno() logic accordingly to the new expel
behaviour.
