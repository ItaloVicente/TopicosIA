DESCRIPTION:

MB-33332: Keep prepare in HashTable at abort - Ephemeral

We need to keep the prepare in the HashTable at abort so that
we do not purge it before replication or leak it on destruction of
the vBucket.

Change-Id: I71952633a7dca0a070b0f766456aa309dd5fdcdb

Line:772, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> As an aside, could we just hoist this into queueAbort so it's more similar to queueDirty?

(Maybe as part of MB-34411) ?
