DESCRIPTION:

MB-39292: 4/n Detect change of immutable property

When updating vbuckets to new/current manifest, compare
all properties of the scope/collection. If for example
the name is not equal use the new
'ImmutablePropertyModified' status to flag such a case.

In the case of a force=true manifest, react to the status
by recreating the collection (with new properties).
