DESCRIPTION:

MB-27174: Remove releaseCookie call from dcpOpen and move reserve

1. Reserve the cookie only on success, reserve means that the engine
is storing a copy of the cookie (so we must inc the ref-count).

2. Remove the explicit call to release from dcpOpen - a frontend
worker thread must not call release-cookie.

These changes have had to be manually tested due to the limited
'full-stack' dcp testing available.

* Code was changed to force the if (handler == nullptr) error to
trigger - and the deadlock was observed (debug attach showed 1 thread
stuck). Removing the releaseCookie removed the deadlock.
