DESCRIPTION:

MB-47197: Start integration with ns_server [2/n]

* Replace the use of the environment variable to enable the
  functionality by using the setting in memcached.json.

* Change the configuration attributes to meet the names
  in the doc: egress_mib_per_min, ingress_mib_per_min,
  num_connections and num_ops_per_min

* Added uuid to the stats (and updated their labels):

    {
      "connections": {
        "current": 10,
        "total": 12
      },
      "cpu": "77 ms",
      "egress_bytes": 144552,
      "ingress_bytes": 144264,
      "num_operations": 6021,
      "rate_limited": {
        "egress_mib_per_min": 0,
        "ingress_mib_per_min": 0,
        "num_connections": 1,
        "num_ops_per_min": 1
      },
      "uuid": "ba7a8907-5762-4eec-3648-fb243ded43ad"
}
