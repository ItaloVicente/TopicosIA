DESCRIPTION:

MB-52490: [wip]

It's possible that a single Producer consumes all backfills.maxRunning
slots. That might happen in the case where a Producer is busy with many
backfills. Eg, the current backfill fixture implementation allows the
follwing:

1. backfills.maxRunning = 4096
2. Two DcpProducer connections with some active/pending backfills
   -> Prod1(active:4096, pending:100), Prod2(active:0, pending:1)
3. Prod1 completes a backfill -> Prod1(active:4095, pending:100)
4. Prod1 is rescheduled to run immediately
5. Prod2 keeps being snoozed and rescheduled to run only after its
   sleep-time (1 sec by default for the BackfillManagerTask)

The consequence is that Prod1 has much more chance to drain its pending
queue than Prod2.

This patch prevents that by increasing the likelihood that a Producer
like Prod2 gets it's backfill slot before Prod1 manages to take its next
one.

The logic change in this patch is that at step (5) Prod2 realizes that
it's being snoozed because some other Producer is consuming all the
available backfill slots. At that point Prod2 reschedules itself to run
immediately (rathar than snoozing).
