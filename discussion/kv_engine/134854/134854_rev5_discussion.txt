DESCRIPTION:

MB-39864: Generate correct collection meta when multiple events exist

It is possible for a single commit batch to contain multiple system
events for a single collection-id. This occurs if state is lost from
the cluster configuration and then we make forward progress. For
example KV could end up in a single flush batch

1) Create collection id:8 name:fruit
2) mutate(key={fruit, apple})
3) Drop collection id:8
4) Create collection id:8 name:vegetable

If that sequence of events occurred KV must generate correct collection
meta-data. KV stores 4 'pieces' of meta-data so that we can recover the
collection state at warm-up, these are:

1) A list of open collections (id, name, TTL, start-seqno)
2) A list of dropped collections (id, start-seqno, end-seqno)
3) A list of open scopes (id, name, start-seqno)
4) The highest manifest ID (of the events)

So when our sequence of events occurs to the same collection:

1) generate meta-data that says only collection with id:8,
   name:vegetable is open
2) collection with id:8 is dropped (with the start/end seqnos covering
   its span)

Without the fixes in this commit we generated meta-data that would
cause a failure at warm-up. For example each collection create in a
single commit batch, lead to a new (duplicate) entry in the list of
open collections.

This commit contains a number of unit tests that generate such
conditions and validate the final meta-data.

A number of issues were found that contributed to failure when running
various create/drop cycles.

1) The VB::Manifest created new checkpoints only for drop-events. This
   is code which wrongly made the assumption that create(id:8),
   drop(id:8) was the only sequence, so only needed to split
   checkpoints on the drop.
2) The Flusher was de-duplicating when multiple events occurred, this
   meant that the code generating the collection meta-data would miss
   any collection drops that occurred between two creates.
3) The Collections::KVStore 'commit meta-data' used data-structures
   that allowed us to capture multiple events and the 'encode'
   functions blindly 'copied' those multiple events to the output.

Summary of fixes:

1) Every system event splits the checkpoint
2) The flusher still de-duplicates system events when writing to the
   KVStore, but all system-events (even de-duped ones) now 'inform'
   the KVStore of their presence.
3) maps are now used so we can detect if multiple events occurred to
   the same collection/scope and the encode functions now generate
   the correct meta-data when create/drop cycles occur.
