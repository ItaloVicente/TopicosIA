DESCRIPTION:

MB-39864: Generate correct collection meta when multiple events exist

It is possible for a single commit batch to contain multiple system
events for a single collection-id. This occurs if state is lost from
the cluster configuration and then we make forward progress. For
example KV could end up in a single flush batch

1) Create collection id:8 name:fruit
2) mutate(key={fruit, apple})
3) Drop collection id:8
4) Create collection id:8 name:vegetable

If that sequence of events occurred KV must generate correct collection
meta-data. KV stores 4 'pieces' of meta-data so that we can recover the
collection state at warm-up, these are:

1) A list of open collections (id, name, TTL, start-seqno)
2) A list of dropped collections (id, start-seqno, end-seqno)
3) A list of open scopes (id, name, start-seqno)
4) The highest manifest ID (of the events)

So when our sequence of events occurs to the same collection:

1) generate meta-data that says only collection with id:8,
   name:vegetable is open
2) collection with id:8 is dropped (with the start/end seqnos covering
   its span)

Without the fixes in this commit we generated meta-data that would
cause a failure at warm-up. For example each collection create in a
single commit batch, lead to a new (duplicate) entry in the list of
open collections.

This commit contains a number of unit tests that generate such
conditions and validate the final meta-data.

A number of issues were found that contributed to failure when running
various create/drop cycles.

1) The VB::Manifest created new checkpoints only for drop-events. This
   is code which wrongly made the assumption that create(id:8),
   drop(id:8) was the only sequence, so only needed to split
   checkpoints on the drop.
2) The Flusher was de-duplicating when multiple events occurred, this
   meant that the code generating the collection meta-data would miss
   any collection drops that occurred between two creates.
3) The Collections::KVStore 'commit meta-data' used data-structures
   that allowed us to capture multiple events and the 'encode'
   functions blindly 'copied' those multiple events to the output.

Summary of fixes:

1) Every system event splits the checkpoint
2) The flusher still de-duplicates system events when writing to the
   KVStore, but all system-events (even de-duped ones) now 'inform'
   the KVStore of their presence.
3) maps are now used so we can detect if multiple events occurred to
   the same collection/scope and the encode functions now generate
   the correct meta-data when create/drop cycles occur.

Line:136, engines/ep/src/collections/kvstore.h -> At at glance it looks like this is only called via record{Create,Drop}... below - can it be made private?

update coming soon, thanks for the comments! next -1 patch updating as well
Line:276, engines/ep/src/collections/kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:55, engines/ep/src/collections/kvstore.h -> Done

Line:136, engines/ep/src/collections/kvstore.h -> done - also gone a bit further and moved the free "encode" functions into this class, as they read most members of this object and return flatbuffer encodings, also private all data members etc... This actually lead to spotting some dead code hanging over from when we used to keep the dropped and open collections in the same meta, so kvstore (magam/couch) has minor simplifications in the next update
