MB-25601: Split memcached_testapp to individual binaries

This allows us to drop the --gtest_filter and make sure that
we run all of the test cases.

What effect does this have on build (link) times - given we are now linking a much larger number of binaries?

I did touch of testapp.cc and gmake -j 8 in tests/testapp. Compiling that file and relinking all files:

make -j 8  10.09s user 2.88s system 482% cpu 2.688 total

With a single file:

make -j 8  2.31s user 0.77s system 186% cpu 1.653 total

so we're talking about 8ish seconds...

So you've made incremental build 5x slower then?

I think that's pretty bad...

That's 8 seconds added to a human's compile-edit-debug cycle when building locally.

That's for their initial make... They shouldn't need to relink all of these files unless they change some of the shared files between all of them (and most people don't really do that).

(we can probably reclaim that speed by killing code elsewhere that we build but not use).
