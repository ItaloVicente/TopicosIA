DESCRIPTION:

MB-51958: Re-enable ReplicaEvictedBeforeActive with fix

ReplicaEvictedBeforeActive was seen to intermittently fail by
mistakenly evicting from the active vBuckets.

---- Root Cause Analysis ----

Because:
1. The ItemPager evicts from PreciseTotalMemoryUsed down to
the low watermark;
2. We populate the replica vBuckets until their total
replicaPageableMemory > (high_watermark - low_watermark);
3. We populate the active vBuckets until
PreciseTotalMemoryUsed > high_watermark.

When we insert the items with a fixed size of 5k bytes, we will
always 'overshoot' the population in (2) and (3) by at least 1
byte, and up to 5k bytes.

With small variations in starting memory usage, and an always
unequal number of replica vs active items, we will occasionally
'overshoot' (3) more.
In other words, we will have:

    PreciseTotalMemoryUsed > replicaPageableMem > high_watermark

Therefore, the ItemPager will be forced to evict
(PreciseTotalMemoryUsed - high_watermark) bytes from the
active vBuckets to reach the low_watermark.

We previously attempted to account for this by adding 10,000
bytes to the minimum required pageableMemory for replica
vBuckets, but this did not prevent the failures, because:

1. populateVbsUntil inserts an item before testing the predicate;
2. We call populateVbsUntil on active vBuckets twice, the second
time to 'top up' to the high watermark, attempting to account
for memory freed by flushing and removing checkpoints;
3. populateVbsUntil was at some point changed to flush and expel
on every mutation, i.e., there is no memory freed by flushing

In other words, we have also 'overpopulated' the active vBuckets
by at least two items, so the described failure can still occur.

Additionally, setting the replica vBucket to replica state will
change the total memory used, possibly invalidating the required
memory preconditions.
Since we must be in the active state to populate the vBucket,
this cannot be avoided with the current approach.

---- Fix ----

After populating up to the high watermark and setting the
replica vBucket state to 'replica', re-set the low watermark,
taking into account how far we may have 'overshot' the high
watermark, and the available replicaPageableMemory.

---- Why did the observed failures evict more than one item?  ----

With the given explanation we may expect only one active item to
be evicted during failures since we can only overshoot by - at
most - the size of one item. However, this is not the case: ~15
items were evicted from active vBuckets in all seen test failures.

This is due to setting items' MFU values probabilistically: with
a given distribution it is almost certain we evict more actives
than strictly needed to reach the low watermark.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hey @james could you have a look at this please?
Dougie's approach is to:
1. Load items into active/replica
2. Then adjust watermarks (before running the core eviction step) for "fixing" any misconfiguration given by (1).

That seems fine to me
