DESCRIPTION:

MB-51958: Re-enable ReplicaEvictedBeforeActive with fix

ReplicaEvictedBeforeActive was seen to intermittently fail by
mistakenly evicting from the active vBuckets.

---- Root Cause Analysis ----

Because:
1. The ItemPager evicts from PreciseTotalMemoryUsed down to
the low watermark;
2. We populate the replica vBuckets until their total
replicaPageableMemory > (high_watermark - low_watermark);
3. We populate the active vBuckets until
PreciseTotalMemoryUsed > high_watermark.

When we insert the items with a fixed size of 5k bytes, we will
always 'overshoot' the population in (2) and (3) by at least 1
byte, and up to 5k bytes.

With small variations in starting memory usage, and an always
unequal number of replica vs active items, we will occasionally
'overshoot' (3) more.
In other words, we will have:

    PreciseTotalMemoryUsed > replicaPageableMem > high_watermark

Therefore, the ItemPager will be forced to evict
(PreciseTotalMemoryUsed - high_watermark) bytes from the
active vBuckets to reach the low_watermark.

Additionally, setting the replica vBuckets to replica state my
change the memory used, possibly invalidating the assumed memory
preconditions.

---- Fix ----

To prevent this, after populating up to the high watermark,
re-set the low watermark, taking into account how far we may
have 'overshot' the high watermark, and the available
replicaPageableMemory.

---- Additional Changes ----

Since populateVbsUntil flushes and expels during population, we
no longer require explicit flushAndRemoveCheckpoints calls or
'topping up' again to the high watermark after them. Remove them.

The quotas were increased by a significant amount (2,500,000
bytes) likely to try to avoid the identified failure.
However, this only made it less likely to occur: a larger quota
leads to a larger watermarkDiff, reducing the chance of a bad
'overshoot'. A larger quota increases the runtime - the test now
runs in ~250ms compared to 1000ms.

==== Additional notes ====

---- More active items evicted than expected ----

With the given explanation we may expect only one active item to
be evicted during failures since we can only overshoot by - at
most - the size of one item. However, this is not the case: ~15
items were evicted from active vBuckets in all seen test failures.

This is due to setting items' MFU values probabilistically: with
a given distribution it is almost certain we evict more actives
than strictly needed to reach the low watermark.

---- Over-over-population ----

Because:
1. populateVbsUntil inserts an item before testing the predicate;
2. We call populateVbsUntil on active vBuckets twice, the second
time to 'top up' to the high watermark, attempting to account
for memory freed by flushing and removing checkpoints;
3. populateVbsUntil was at some point changed to flush and expel
on every mutation, i.e., there is no memory freed by flushing

Then we actually overshoot populating the active vBuckets by at
least two items.
This should cause the test to always fail, but is masked by a
similar logic error: over-population of the replica vBuckets.
We populate until 'pageableMem > watermarkDiff + 10000'; which
is exactly the size of two items.
