DESCRIPTION:

MB-28941: Remove TraceCodes which we didn't previously track in histograms

Session Tracing is currently exceeding its performance budget of 1%
overhead. As such, remove all the TraceCodes which were not previously
tracked in histograms prior to Session Tracing - remove the calls to
TRACE_SCOPE(code), along with the enum definitions.

Also remove codes which were defined but never used
(e.g. SETITEMINFO).

In micro-benchmarks this reduces the cost of our simulated SET
operation by 1/3 (as we've reduced the number of trace spans from 3 to
2).
