Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

(9 comments)

Only got halfway through the review, but some comments already for you...
File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Might be worth linking / committing (or just listing inline in the commit message if small) the script(s) you used to do the search/replace.
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: Use present tense: "Migrate LOG calls..."

Line:78, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> Can you double-check the level of these messages (and what's printed by default)?

I /think/ that we didn't (before spdlog) used to print INFO messages by default - certainly we shouldn't be printing this particular message by default) as we'll be printing a load of stuff when the access scanner runs.

Also - I know you probably used a script to do all this, but might as well remove the redundant INFO prefix here.

Line:145, engines/ep/src/access_scanner.cc -> Given spdlog / fmt can print std::string directly, no need to call c_str() on the strings. Probably worth expanding your script / add another step to remove any c_strs() in macros you have changed (you can do this in a follow-up patch if you want).

Line:77, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> Similar to c_str() - we no longer need this cast - it was necessary before as there isn't a printf-style formatter for size_t; but pretty sure spdlog can handle that.

Line:125, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_config.cc -> Probably for a separate follow-up patch; but it would be nice to shift the formatting currently done by stringstream here into the macro - as that would avoid paying any of the formatting cost unless have the level enabled.

In this case (WARN) It'll always be printed so doesn't make a difference, but in general that would be preferred.

Line:108, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Similar to previous; we can remove the static_cast<> now.

Line:61, engines/ep/src/defragmenter.cc -> re: previous comment(s) - this is definately a case which (a) shouldn't be printed by default; and (b) will hence remove a bunch of string formatting from the common path by moving the formatting into spdlog /fmt.

Line:189, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> You can drop any explicit \n from log messages.

Default level was NOTICE so changed any old INFO levels to debug level

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:125, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_config.cc -> Removed stream formatting where trivial before calling ep logging macros. In some cases such as flusher/item_compressor/item_freq_decayer spdlog complains about stream operators after moving formatting in the macro. Will defer these until a later patch set
