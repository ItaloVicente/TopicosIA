DESCRIPTION:

MV-30302: Use of new Spdlog style formatting in EP Engine

Changed BucketLogger to track memory within the engine thread. Failed tests
after converting all messages to use the new macros as the formatting was
being tracked until we hit the _sink_it_ method. Migrated LOG calls in EP
Engine to use the new EP_LOG_ macros. Unified vbucket logging to use the
format vb:xx throughout.
