DESCRIPTION:

Fix incorrect assignment to EngineErrorGetScopeIDResult

This patch fixes Collections::Manager::doOneScopeStats() by changing it
returns is scopeID after parsing a scopeID using std::stoi(). Currently
we create a cb::EngineErrorGetScopeIDResult() and instantiate using the
ScopeID() object. This is wrong, as this then cast implicitly to a
uint64_t, which is is treated as the manifestId and is thus assigned to
the manifestId member of cb::EngineErrorGetScopeIDResult() rather than
the scopeId member. Which could then end up with us perform incorrect
privilege checks for Collections::Manager::doOneScopeStats().

So to fix this ensure we assign the scopeID to
cb::EngineErrorGetScopeIDResult.scopeId directly.

Line:649, engines/ep/src/collections/manager.cc -> I'm not sure of Jim's intent here - given this would previously set the result to cb::engine_errc::unknown_scope and now it will be 'failed'. Suggest @jim takes a look at this when he gets back.

Line:649, engines/ep/src/collections/manager.cc -> The code's definitley wrong :() the fix here isn't right either.

So I think the code was trying to re-use the res.scopeID to store scopeId down to the checkPrivilege call on line 664, but the construction is incorrect (as you have spotted, manifestID is being initialised with the scope). I think the original intent was that the if and else (line 635 to 661) use 'res', so when we hit line 664 'res' stores a valid scope.

From what I can see else block is correct, although that EP_LOG_WARN could be removed now, same as line 641, no real need to log a warning there either.

However I can see a problem when the scope-id given to use via the 'atoi' route is invalid, i.e. it is a valid format, just an unknown scope. 

If we do your fix and we feed the code with an unknown scope, e.g. 9 the checkPrivilege call will return 'unknown_scope' and we will return that to the caller, but the manifest-id of 'res' is 0 (never set). Whenever KV returns unknown scope or unknown collection we should also return the manifest-ID relating to failed 'look-up'.

So in the current code, the 'atoi' route is never doing a "is this a real scope check" before calling checkPrivilege, whereas the else block does (because it uses the manifest for name to id search)

In summary we need to change code so that the if block does a scope-id check, but no method exists at the moment (that I can see)

e.g. 

    if (cb_isPrefix(statKey, "scopes-byid")) {
        ScopeID scopeID;
        // provided argument should be a hex scope ID N, 0xN or 0XN
        try {
            scopeID = std::stoi(arg, nullptr, 16);
        } catch (const std::logic_error& e) {
            EP_LOG_WARN(
                    "Collections::Manager::doOneScopeStats invalid "
                    "scope arg:{}, exception:{}",
                    arg,
                    e.what());
            return cb::EngineErrorGetScopeIDResult{
                    cb::engine_errc::invalid_arguments};
        }
        res = bucket.getCollectionsManager().isValidScopeID(scopeID);
    } else {


And the check for !success in the else block should be moved out so it is checking both the if/else

Make sense?
