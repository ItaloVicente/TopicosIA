DESCRIPTION:

MB-29274: Add a mutext to ep_test_apis.cc::add_response

A newly enabled test is using many client threads resulting in a race
condition when the shared last_body/last_key/last_ext objects are
written to without a lock.

This patch adds a single lock inside add_response as the tests are not
actually using any of the add_response variables (if they were then
thread local variables will need to be used).
