DESCRIPTION:

cbstats: Fix utf-8 & term size detection

These appear to have been broken in the move to Python 3. With these
changes we:

a) Correctly enable UTF-8 symbols for the bar chars on capable
   terminals (previously the check always failed).

b) If output is redirected to a file we incorrectly still used the
   underlying terminal's width, and not 80 columns.
