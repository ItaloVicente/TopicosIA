DESCRIPTION:

MB-54810: Include overflow samples in Prometheus histograms

Make use of the newly-added overflow metrics in timing histograms to
show the number of samples which exceeded the representable range of
the histogram.

Example output from _prometheusMetricsHigh endpoint, with 1000
"overflowed" samples synthesized:

    $ http --auth Administrator:asdasd http://localhost:11996/_prometheusMetricsHigh|rg kv_cmd_duration_seconds | rg -w GET
    kv_cmd_duration_seconds_count{bucket="default",opcode="GET"} 4052 1676562996000
    kv_cmd_duration_seconds_sum{bucket="default",opcode="GET"} 0.049494 1676562996000
    kv_cmd_duration_seconds_bucket{bucket="default",opcode="GET",le="0.000001"} 1 1676562996000
    ...
    kv_cmd_duration_seconds_bucket{bucket="default",opcode="GET",le="33.554432"} 3052 1676562996000
    kv_cmd_duration_seconds_bucket{bucket="default",opcode="GET",le="65.011712"} 3052 1676562996000
    kv_cmd_duration_seconds_bucket{bucket="default",opcode="GET",le="+Inf"} 4052 1676562996000

Note that up to the highest bucket the histogram tracks (65s) there
are cumulatively 3052 samples; however at the "infinity" bucket there
are an additional 1000 samples. These are also reflected in the _count
metric.

Line:57, statistics/prometheus_collector.cc -> Won't altering the count but not the sum lead to lower than expected mean calculations in Prometheus?

I get that we can't meaningfully update the sum as we don't know the overflowed values as it stands...
IIRC Vesko mentioned on a different patch that a future enhancement could be to track min/mean/max of the overflow bucket; seems like with at least the mean we could update the sum with the overflow bucket info.

Potentially. We are in a sub-optimal place here, given the APIs which prometheus exposes:

a) We either entirely ignore the overflow count in what we report to prometheus (don't include them in the le=inf bucket) - but count and sum are "correct", or

b) We do include the overflowed count in le=inf - ie. this patch; but we potentially have an inaccurate mean. 

_Ideally_ we would have no overflow and always bucket data, but we don't live in that world and it's not trivial to "fix" HdrHistogram to do that.

What I would highlight is we would _expect_ overflow count to be small vs the non-overflowed values; so mean, estimated quartiles are not expected to be significantly affected.

> IIRC Vesko mentioned on a different patch that a future enhancement could be to track min/mean/max of the overflow bucket; seems like with at least the mean we could update the sum with the overflow bucket info.

We could track a sum of the overflow; but again I'd argue that's of limited value as we don't have the distribution of the samples - which is kinda what histograms are trying to give you.

Ultimately I think the way forward (if overflowed samples are considered significant enough to warrant work in this area) would be to change to a different histogram impl which can support a much wider range (ideally everything we ever encounter) but with a similar memory footprint to hdr_histogram.

This would at least allow us to meet the expectation of Prometheus histograms.

I think having an asterisk of "if you have overflows, your mean is wrong" is a bit too much of a foot gun - it's not inconceivable that someone has a dashboard showing computed means, which after upgrading couchbase serve now significantly misrepresent the mean when overflowed values are present.

For an extreme case, imagine a histogram _only_ recorded overflowed samples, so _only_ had samples in the Inf bucket. It now has a sample count != 0, but a sample sum = 0, and yet a cumulative distribution which indicates there are no samples less than the upper bound of the highest real bucket.

Recording the overflow sum seems sufficient to bring the Prometheus sum back in line.

I also can't warrant that no other prometheus functions rely on a "correct" sum.

Line:57, statistics/prometheus_collector.cc -> Their mean was already "wrong" before - we blindly ignored any values over 60s (for most of the histograms we are talking about here), so the fact we now give them a different "wrong" mean doesn't seem any worse than before.

I'd argue mean is pretty useless for most things you're tracking in histograms - the interesting metrics are at the high percentiles.

Note that p50, p90 etc _are_ more meaningful now, as they include the overflow samples (via the le=inf bucket) - they aren't affected by the lack of the sum,

Line:57, statistics/prometheus_collector.cc -> Before the mean omitted samples, now it will actively move in the wrong direction because every overflowed sample "appears" to be a sample at 0 (count went up, sum did not, same behaviour as recording a 0), and will then be "poisoned" to be below the correct value forever.
With the overflow sum, the mean is "right", and the cost is tracking one extra value per histogram :shrug:

I'd forseen the argument of "they're looking at the wrong thing", but that doesn't stop people doing it ;)

Will defer to you if you think the cost/benefit doesn't line up :vaultboy:

Line:57, statistics/prometheus_collector.cc -> Fair point about the (lack of) samples vs bias.

I'll see if I can easily add it - it doesn't ready help the cbstats-style histograms as they display the different percentiles and those are still limited to the tracked buckets, but for Prometheus mean I can see value...
