DESCRIPTION:

MB-33332: Fix Ephemeral Abort setting prepare to stale

The abort implementation for ephemeral during a range read is not
correct. Currently we will mark an aborted prepare as stale. This
means that the next run of the StaleItemPurger will remove the
aborted prepare from the seqList and prevent any DCP consumer from
receiving it. We should instead treat the aborted prepare like a
typical delete tombstone.
