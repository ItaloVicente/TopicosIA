DESCRIPTION:

Drop SASL auth logging to debug as they can be noise

Drop the SASL auth logging to debug level in
SaslAuthTask::notifyExecutionComplete() can be noisy if there are
repeated SASL failures. Which fills up the memcached.log meaning we
rotate over other useful information.

I'm not sure if it is a good idea.. we've had bug reports in the past where we couldn't identify why stuff got disconnected or didn't work..

Might be worth removing the change for AUTH_PROVIDER_DIED, as the other three are user related and would be seen by the client requesting them? Plus they're more likely to crop up in a situation where they would be spamming our logs.
