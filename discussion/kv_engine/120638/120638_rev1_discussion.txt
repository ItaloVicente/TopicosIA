DESCRIPTION:

magma-kvstore: Avoid generating item string in compaction callback

Perf profile showed that std::stringstream object is consuming
signifiant percentage of cpu even when the object is not used for string
allocation. This causes spikes in write queue when compaction is
performed. Refactored code to use a stringstream object for generating
debug item string only if it is invoked in trace level logging.

Perf profile:
