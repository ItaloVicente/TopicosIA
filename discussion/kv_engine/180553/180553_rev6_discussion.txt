DESCRIPTION:

MB-53829: Initialise disk stat cache during CouchKVStore::initialize

Prior to this change we didn't initialise the disk stat cache during
warmup (unless the vbucket state needed to be persisted, which ended up
updating them in writeVBucketState).

We now initialise the cached stats and update them whenever we read the
new values from disk.

Line:20, daemon/buckets_test.cc -> Do you know why Bucket has increased in size? There's nothing jumping out to me in the patch...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:20, daemon/buckets_test.cc -> I just pushed the change to the wrong patch by mistake (the test doesn't run locally), sorry. The size of the Bucket hasn't changed.
