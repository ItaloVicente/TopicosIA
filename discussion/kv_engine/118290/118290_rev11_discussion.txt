DESCRIPTION:

MB-37505: Add Impersonate to mcbp protocol

Impersonate allows a user to execute a command as another user without
authenticating as that user (similar to `sudo` in a Unix system). The
biggest difference between `impersonate` and the `sudo` command is
that the latter allows for privilege escalation. Impersonate will run
the command _as_ the requested user, but the effective privilege set
during the command execution is the intersection of the authenticated
users effective privilege set and the impersonated users available
privilege set.

Requirements:

* The connection must possess the `Impersonate` privilege
* The impersonated user must have access to Couchbase

Limitations:

* The impersonated user must be defined as a local user in Couchbase
  (fixing this require features in ns_server)
* The users with the `impersonate` privilege may execute commands as
  _any_ user defined in Couchbase (you can't specify that "Bob" can
  impersonate "Alice" but not "Joan")

Patch Set 11: Code-Review-1

(3 comments)
Line:383, daemon/connection.cc -> Nit: Odd extra whitespace here.

Line:174, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> No details here on how the flex frame is encoded (what length is used etc).

Line:101, protocol/connection/frameinfo.cc -> This looks similar (same?) as LEB128 encoding. If so, can we just use the existing functions we have to encode that?

Line:383, daemon/connection.cc -> Done

Line:174, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> all of that is descibed in a "generic" section above so I figured we wouldn't need a printout? I'll add one if you really insist.. this is what we said above:

The framing extras is encoded as a series of variable-length `FrameInfo` objects.

Each `FrameInfo` consists of:

* 4 bits: *Object Identifier*. Encodes first 15 object IDs directly; with the 16th value (15) used
   as an escape to support an additional 256 IDs by combining the value of the next byte:
   * `0..14`: Identifier for this element.
   * `15`: Escape: ID is 15 + value of next byte.
* 4 bits: *Object Length*. Encodes sizes 0..14 directly; value 15 is
   used to encode sizes above 14 by combining the value of a following
   byte:
   * `0..14`: Size in bytes of the element data.
   * `15`: Escape: Size is 15 + value of next byte (after any object ID
   escape bytes).
* N Bytes: *Object data*.

Line:101, protocol/connection/frameinfo.cc -> I'll look into that (at least we can use a generic method ;))

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:174, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> What wasn't clear was what was encoded in the Flex Frame Extra - there's no mention that the username is encoded as a string, the length of the entire payload.
