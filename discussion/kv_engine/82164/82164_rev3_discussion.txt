DESCRIPTION:

RocksDB: Introduce RocksDBKVStore

RocksDBKVStore is an experimental KVStore implementation backed by
RocksDB. It is very incomplete, and is not intended for general usage.

As such, it is hidden behind the `EP_USE_ROCKSDB` flag.

To use it, one can build with (for example)

make EXTRA_CMAKE_OPTIONS='-DEP_USE_ROCKSDB=ON'

As there is no UI involvement, buckets must be created as a normal
Couchbase bucket, and then have the backend changed with the following
diag/eval

 curl -X POST -u Administrator:asdasd http://localhost:9000/diag/eval \
 -d 'ns_bucket:update_bucket_props("bucket_name", [{extra_config_string,"backend=rocksdb"}]).'

Looking good. I've been relatively forgiving with much of this given it's been pulled in from old patches, but I've highlighted a major / easy to fix things which would be good to address.
Line:160, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> Whitespace-only change.

Line:258, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> Style: Given you're adding this all over the place; might be nicer to define a higher-level ${EP_STORAGE_LIBS} variable which is initialised to "couchstore", and then has forestdb/rocksdb appended to it where applicable.

This would reduce the need for various targets to have to explicitly specify all the storage backends.

Line:76, engines/ep/src/kvstore.cc -> Style: Given you're changing this, just move to use std::string's equality operator.

Line:69, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> Please move the body to .cc

Line:84, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> Move to .cc

Line:101, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> Move to .cc

Line:110, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> ditto

Line:184, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> I /think/ this might be valid now - can you check and if so remove the TODO

Line:323, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> Move to .cc

Line:328, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> Move to .cc

Line:350, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> Style: Given we are C++11 now, can use `= delete` to disable it more explicitly.
