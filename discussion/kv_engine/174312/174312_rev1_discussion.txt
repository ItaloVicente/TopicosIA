DESCRIPTION:

MB-51956: Remove the QueueDirtyWithManyClosedUnrefCheckpoints bench

The test was designed to measure the contention between frontend writes
and the (old) CheckpointRemoverTask performing checkpoint removal.
Since Neo the latter doens't exist anymore, replaced by eager
checkpoint removal.
Actually there is a code path that can potentially do a bulk checkpoint
removal (also of many checkpoints, once MB-50984 is done): that is
checkpoint removal triggered by CursorDrop. But note that that code
path calls down into CM::extractClosedUnrefCheckpoints(), which is the
old O(N) bit now O(1) and already covered by the
ExtractClosedUnrefCheckpoints bench.
