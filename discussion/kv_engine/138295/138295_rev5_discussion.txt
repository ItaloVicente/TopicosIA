DESCRIPTION:

MB-41728: Use logarithmic buckets for exposing histograms to Prometheus

Percentile based iteration of HdrHistograms provides valuable detail,
but does not lead to consistent bucket bounds and is therefore
unacceptable for Prometheus.

Buckets changing over time leads to a large number of Prometheus time
series, and leads to problems when querying.

Furthermore, percentiles do not necessarily lead to unique bucket
bounds. This leads to a single prometheus scrape finding multiple
results for the same apparent lower bound (as encountered in MB-41728).
