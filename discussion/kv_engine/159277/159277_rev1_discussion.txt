DESCRIPTION:

MB-47009: When resuming a filtered snapshot, check we reach the end

In the MB a stream is resumed, but has a snapshot end greater than the
start-seqno, if the mutations in the range start to snap-end are filtered
away the stream remains dormant and the client assumes the end has yet to
be reached.

We now check for this situation when generating a memory snapshot and
ensures snapshot+seqno advance gets the client to the snap-end seqno.
