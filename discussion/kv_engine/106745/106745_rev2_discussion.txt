DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add new magma storage engine configuration parameters

Add the configuration parameters necessary to configure magma.

Most of the configuration parameters are pass thru except for
MaxWriteCacheSize. MaxWriteCacheSize is the buffer that holds the items
prior to them being flushed to the sstables. The items are first flushed
to the WAL for persistence and the item is held in a shard level
skiplist until its flushed to an sstable.

WriteCacheSize = BucketQuota / # shards * Mem Quota Ratio
AND
WriteCacheSize >= 8MB <= 128MB.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

Line:1018, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I don't really understand what this setting does - for someone not familiar with Magma internals this is pretty meaningless:

- what's "LSD"?
- what's the write cache buffer of deleted seqnos (and why do we need a buffer of deleted seqnos?
- is this a setting which is used for two different purposes?

Might be worth expanding the description, and if it's two different settings breaking into two parameters.

Line:1024, engines/ep/configuration.json -> This doesn't really give any more details than the name of the config variable. Could you expand to explain what this is actually used for?

Line:1039, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I think this name is misleading - it's not a minimal value size, it's more like a minimum for value separation. Can you rename to something more explicit?

Line:1048, engines/ep/configuration.json -> This might be a bit aggressive for a large number of buckets - 20 buckets even with the default of 4 shards is 640MB straight away for write caching.

Also - we don't currently have any per-shard limits - it would be better if this was specified in the config file as a per-bucket limit, and have libmagma or MagmaKVStore perform the calculation to divide it per shard.

Line:1054, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Similar comment here - if someone's running a single bucket with say 500GB bucket quota, would it be useful to allow more than 512MB of memory for the write buffer?

Line:1066, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I don't really understand this - why does the WAL have a memory buffer? Surely the whole point of the WAL is it's written to disk immediately upon commit?

Line:1087, engines/ep/configuration.json -> This name isn't particulary explicit -maybe something like "magma_create_commit_point_on_every_batch" ?

Line:1093, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Again, this name isn't particularly obvious / explicit - it describes the internal details, not what the effect of this is. Assuming I understand correctly, this actually controls if accurate num_items is provided by magma - I think naming it along those lines is more meaningful.

Line:1102, engines/ep/configuration.json -> typo

Line:1104, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Why would we not always want to expire items during compaction - given they will just take up unnecessary space?

Also - what is this threshold in terms of?

Line:1110, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Similar comment - what is this threshold in terms of?

Line:34, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> "Ubuntu" is pretty meaningless - which version? Additionally it's probably less about the OS and more about the compiler version. If you do want to add a comment like this, I'd be explicit about the actual compiler version - although see the below comments...

Line:37, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> If you want to check the pack is being applied correctly, then add a static_assert and the compiler will ensure the check.

Also - not sure the comment is correct - we use #pragma pack in plenty of places just for specific class members and have static assets checking the result - see couch-kvstore-metadata.h for example.

Line:121, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Suggest you delete this now given you've moved the pragma to the top of the class.

Line:245, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Style - you don't need to pre-declare variables in C++ - just move this declaration to be part of the definition at line 253. See http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#es22-dont-declare-a-variable-until-you-have-a-value-to-initialize-it-with

Line:247, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Can be const.

Line:259, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> through

Line:265, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Log messages must be single-line in Couchbase Server. Please remove any carriage returns.

Line:267, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Style: I find placing say a : between the name and the value of things like this makes them easier to read - for example without such punctuation it's ambiguous if say #Shards  refers to the value before or after it.

Line:316, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Why a shared_ptr - what's the ownership model of this logger?

Line:91, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore_config.h -> As per previous comments on configuration.json, the descriptions here aren't very helpful. Please expand them.

Line:6729, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please keep these sorted alphabetically.

Line:1039, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Done

Line:1048, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I've explained why the numbers picked are what they are.
Deciding when magma can be used is probably a bigger question and might need addressed outside a code review.

Line:1054, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Done

Line:1066, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I've added more documentation.
But, I'm also a bit confused by the comment. The WAL needs some kind of buffer to hold the items from a batch. Were you expecting that every item is immediately flushed?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1066, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Well, that's the point of the write-ahead-log, right? Otherwise we cannot claim an item has been persisted (and hence persistTo latencies and things like SyncWrites will be delayed until the data has actually hit disk).

Interesting. So it would seem like the usage in couch-kvstore-metadata.h is technically incorrect; however the actual sizes / offsets of the members in question means they are packed by default anyways - note the static_assets which check the expected sizes pass.

I'll raise a patch to fix the usages in couch-kvstore-metadata.h etc to they are at least correct; I suggest here you just add a static_assert() which ensures the size is as expected (given this is written directly to disk we need a stable binary layout).
