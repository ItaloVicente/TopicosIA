DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add new magma storage engine configuration parameters

Add the configuration parameters necessary to configure magma.

Most of the configuration parameters are pass thru except for
MaxWriteCacheSize. MaxWriteCacheSize is the buffer that holds the items
prior to them being flushed to the sstables. The items are first flushed
to the WAL for persistence and the item is held in a shard level
skiplist until its flushed to an sstable.

WriteCacheSize = BucketQuota / # shards * Mem Quota Ratio
AND
WriteCacheSize >= 8MB <= 128MB.

Additional http://review.couchbase.org/107094 checkin done to magma to
link EP engine config parameters document. Leaving as google sheet for
now while magma remains in a state of flux and once we have completed
the necessary changes, testing and review comments, we can fold the
sheet into the magma README.md file.

The failures in ASan-UBSan.silent-DJR_testing (where the magma repo is checked out and built) look legitimate - those test are normally pretty stable:

 [  FAILED  ] 11 tests, listed below:
 [  FAILED  ] BucketLoggerEngineTest.EngineTest
 [  FAILED  ] BucketLoggerTest.TraceMacro
 [  FAILED  ] BucketLoggerTest.DebugMacro
 [  FAILED  ] BucketLoggerTest.InfoMacro
 [  FAILED  ] BucketLoggerTest.WarnMacro
 [  FAILED  ] BucketLoggerTest.CriticalMacro
 [  FAILED  ] BucketLoggerTest.TraceRawMacro
 [  FAILED  ] BucketLoggerTest.DebugRawMacro
 [  FAILED  ] BucketLoggerTest.InfoRawMacro
 [  FAILED  ] BucketLoggerTest.WarnRawMacro
 [  FAILED  ] BucketLoggerTest.CriticalRawMacro

(See http://cv.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/kv_engine.ASan-UBSan.silent.DJR_testing/job/master/142/consoleFull#1083994859c5751633-7aa5-473a-91e8-426e0afa5a7b)

Note that kv_engine.ASan-UBSan is an indentical  job but without the kv_ee projects (i.e.magma), and that passes. Note (2) that I've re-triggered the failing CV job and see the same result, so this doesn't look like an intermittent failure.

Patch Set 13:

This issue with the bucketlogger tests failing is because the string being printed for info (INFO, DEBUG, CRITICAL, etc) is lower case in the file and the test is looking for UPPER case. No idea how magma changes could impact that. Ideas?

 i think an incompatiblity with your version of spdlog. you’re pulling it from github iirc and we grab it from third_party/spdlog. We set custom levels that i think just capitalise the original levels. I’m guessing your spdlog is overriding that
