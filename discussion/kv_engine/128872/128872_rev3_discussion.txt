DESCRIPTION:

MB-37374: DCP Consumer accepts user-xattrs in SyncDelete

This ended up in a test-only patch (plus some extra validation)
as so far no further change seems necessary at Consumer for
supporting IncludeDeletedUserXattrs for DCP_PREPARE.

Change-Id: I9a138f48cc03d4900cb01008b9b50f411451670e
