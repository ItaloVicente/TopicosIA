DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor] Remove boilerplate in Settings

Previously one needed to add a separate callback function
in order to handle a new key in the configuration, even
if the callback function only needed to pick out a simple
boolean from provided JSON.

This code replace that "callback table" with checking
for the keys and just do the update.
