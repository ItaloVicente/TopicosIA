DESCRIPTION:

MB-25785: Ask a DCP client with diverging branch @ seqno 0 to rollback

It is possible that a DCP client can have a diverging branch (vb_uuid
mismatch) at seqno 0. Even though, it is not terribly incorrect to
go on with the DCP stream request without asking the client to rollback
when start_seqno is 0, recently a backup client has faced an issue with
this.

The commit fixes the bug by asking the client to rollback even though
it has a diverging branch at seqno 0. Also test cases are added for
the same and some of the exisiting test cases which didn't care about
the vb_uuid when stat_seqno is 0 are updated accordingly.

Also the commit ensures that, with this change, we do not end sending
rollback to clients with matching vb_uuid and start_seqno == 0 but
start_seqno < purge_seqno. That is, the behavior here is retained
as before.

@Manu - note the spock-post-commit build started failing after this was merged: http://cv.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/kv-engine-spock-post-commit/293/

Note there /were/ other (non KV-Engine) changes in that build, however please could you investigate and verify it's not related to this patch?

Thanks.

Took a quick look at the logs from the above link, and memcached is *full* of lines like:

 2017-11-21T12:28:19.914549-08:00 WARNING (default) DCP (Producer) eq_dcpq:replication:n_0@127.0.0.1->n_2@127.0.0.1:default - (vb 1023) Stream request requires rollback to seqno:0 because vBucket UUID not found in failover table, consumer and producer have no common history. Client requested seqnos:{0,18446744073709551615} snapshot:{0,0} uuid:223498653015353

Looks like ns_server might need to be updated for this change. I'm going to revet this patch for now to restore the build.
