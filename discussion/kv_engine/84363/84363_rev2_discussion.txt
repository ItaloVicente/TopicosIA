DESCRIPTION:

MB-26390: CouchKVStore::getMultiCb: set non-zero status correctly

If a couchstore file becomes corrupted such that a document cannot be
fetched from disk using getMulti (returning CHECKSUM_FAIL or any other
non-zero status), then instead of logging and returning a error to the
user (TMPFAIL), KV-Engine incorrectly returns ENOENT - i.e. document
doesn't exist.

The issue is that the status code was set *after* the rest of GetValue
had already been assigned elsewhere, meaning a non-zero status code
was lost. The bug was introduced by commit
4df093d4e1e7c65158c8539604b6f1907951ae15, which refactored GetMulti
ownership.

The handling of read failures will probably change in vulcan anyways, to support autofailover on disk issues. That's actually how I discovered this bug - was testing what we currently do when a read error occurs.
