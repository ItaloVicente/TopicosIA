DESCRIPTION:

MB-26390: CouchKVStore::getMultiCb: set non-zero status correctly

If a couchstore file becomes corrupted such that a document cannot be
fetched from disk using getMulti (returning CHECKSUM_FAIL or any other
non-zero status), then instead of logging and returning a error to the
user (TMPFAIL), KV-Engine incorrectly returns ENOENT - i.e. document
doesn't exist.

The issue is that the status code was set *after* the rest of GetValue
had already been assigned elsewhere, meaning a non-zero status code
was lost. The bug was introduced by commit
4df093d4e1e7c65158c8539604b6f1907951ae15, which refactored GetMulti
ownership.

Why not just extend mcctl to add support for evict instead of creating yet another tool (which we don't install and can't be used on sure by people if they really want it..)

It's not intended as a supported tool (not it's not installed); it's just a simple script which uses the existing mc_bin_client to evict a key. I don't actually *want* end-users to use this ;)
