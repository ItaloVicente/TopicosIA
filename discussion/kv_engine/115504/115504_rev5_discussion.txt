DESCRIPTION:

MB-23086: Do not dlopen any engine shared objects

To enable the Thread Local Storage model of initial-exec in
ep-engine/jemalloc we should no longer dlopen ep.so.

Since memcached is already opening all engine's with dlopen during
initialisation we can now move over to just linking the engine's against
memcached.

The enginemap code is changed to now call pre-defined symbols of each
engine for the creation of an engine instance and for the final shutdown
of the engine.

For engine_testapp it now uses BucketType for bucket creation.
The -E parameter is now changed to select the BucketType to use
for testing and engine_testapp is now linked against all bucket
shared objects.
