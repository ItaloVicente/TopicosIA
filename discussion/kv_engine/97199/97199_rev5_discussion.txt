DESCRIPTION:

MB-30532: Don't acquire the queueLock for computing the checkpoint-id

Currently in the execution of PassiveStream::handleSnapshotEnd we
acquire/release the CheckpointManager::queueLock twice:
- when getting the id of the open checkpoint for computing the newId
- when calling CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint(newId)

Given that the CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint function is called only
by PS::handleSnapshotEnd and it executes under queueLock, then we can
just compute the newId in CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Would be nice to see the before/after perf numbers in the commit message (from your new benchmark).
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This is all correct; however I think the key part of this change isn't only locking once, but it's not iterating all checkpoints in the manager when determining the new ID - i.e. it's changing from an O(n) to O(1) algorithm. 

Assuming I'm right, I think it's worth re-phrasing the commit message to focus on that.

Line:350, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> I'm surprised your patch is changing test behaviour - i.e. the range is now different.

Let's discuss this when you get back.

Line:350, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> These are the behaviours before/after my change:

Caption:
cs = checkpoint start
ce = checkpoint end

[Before]

1) we add 10 items in the open (unique) checkpoint; we have just the persistence cursor on it:

id=1
| cs  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 | 
  ^

2) we create a new checkpoint. Now we have 1 closed referenced checkpoint (not that the cursor is still on it) and the new open one with id=2

id=1                                          id=2
| cs  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  ce |     | cs |
  ^ 

3) we do manager->getAllItemsForCursor(). This moves the cursor to the start of the second checkpoint

id=1                                          id=2
| cs  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  ce |     | cs |
                                                ^ 

4) we do manager->checkAndAddNewCheckpoint(1, ..).
In the original code that collapses the 2 checkpoints in a new single one having [id=3, rangeStart=1, rangeEnd=10]:

id=3
| cs  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 | 
                                 ^

5) we do manager->getAllItemsForCursor(). We expect:
- no items
- range [1, 10]


[After]
! We don't collapse anymore !

1) same as above
2) same as above
3) we do manager->getAllItemsForCursor(), same as above
4) we do manager->checkAndAddNewCheckpoint(1, ..). 
Now the code tries to create the 3rd checkpoint. But, given that the 2nd one is empty, it just updates the open checkpoint id to 3:

id=1                                          id=3
| cs  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  ce |     | cs |
                                                ^ 

5) we do manager->getAllItemsForCursor(). We expect:
- no items
- range [10, 10]

Line:350, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Thanks for the detailed explanation - that's clear now. Couple of comments:

* You don't mention that the checkpoint collapsing no longer occurs in the commit message. I think this needs to be explicit (as it's a change in external behaviour; nut just changing internal details of when we acquire locks).
* I think I'm still missing something - *why* do we no longer collapse the checkpoints here? In fact; why is it safe for us to remove the checkpoint collapsing code in the first place?

(To put this another way - the current commit message is phrased in terms of simply optimising the implementation of checkpoint end; however in reality you are  also changing behaviour (which allows you to optimise things).

The change in behaviour is much more important to highlight (IMHO); could you re-phase the commit to focus on this please?

Furthermore, I'm thinking you should split this patch further - first making the change which removes possibility to collapse checkpoints; and then making the optimisations to locking / assuming checkpoint IDs are incrementing.

Line:350, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Sure I'm fixing the commit message (which is currently wrong in many different ways :) ).

Ensuring that checkpoint IDs are strictly incremental here is the key:
1) we cannot face anymore the case where newId<=prevId. 
That was the only condition that triggered checkpoint-collapsing.
2) we don't need to check if newId<=prevId applies (this one is the big optimization, it is a (slow) linear scan on CM::checkpointList)

I could split again in multiple patches, but this is a kind of unique logic set of changes:
- we compute id=prevId+1 under lock inside the CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint (first optimization, we lock once rather than twice)
- so, we ensure that id>prevId always
- so, we don't need to scan the CM::checkpointList to check if id<=prevId (second optimization)
- so, we don't need to collapse to ensure that checkpoint IDs are incremental (change in behaviour, it was executed only if id<=prevId)

I can keep this change and add the changes-logic-sequence mentioned into the commit message.
Or, I can split in multiple changes as suggested.
I'm happy with both.

-------------------
Some comments about collapsing follow. My considerations may be wrong, so others' opinion is very welcome :) :

I'm not 100% sure of what is the main purpose of the  CM::collapseCheckpoint function.
Looking at code, it is a way to ensure that the checkpoint IDs are incremental.
But, it seems also a way for decreasing memory usage, as we do de-duplication in there. Probably it is not a case that this code is executed only when mem_used>high_wat.

Note that the function is not covered by unit tests, apart from the one above where we check the range, but:
- we don't test de-duplication
- we don't test cursor re-positioning

So:

1) in theory, on one side we could have an increase in memory usage as we don't collapse anymore. But, this change aims to prevent high memory usage by closing checkpoints ASAP (snap-end) rather than letting them growing and then collapsing if mem_used>high_wat
- a criticism to this is that with collapsing/de-dup we release memory immediately, while with checkpoint-closing the release is deferred to when the closed-checkpoint becomes unreferenced and the CheckpointRemover task runs
- but, a good point is that the memory release on collapsing/de-dup depends on the type of workload (creates/updates), while checkpoint-closing doesn't

2) about the change in behaviour, it seems to me that here our worst-case is that we don't run some untested code, so not so bad :)
