DESCRIPTION:

MB-30532: Don't acquire the queueLock for computing the checkpoint-id

Currently in the execution of PassiveStream::handleSnapshotEnd we
acquire/release the CheckpointManager::queueLock twice:
- when getting the id of the open checkpoint for computing the newId
- when calling CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint(newId)

Given that the CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint function is called only
by PS::handleSnapshotEnd and it executes under queueLock, then we can
just compute the newId in CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint.

Line:1177, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> This was never executed as 'id' in input is always 'getOpenCheckpointId() + 1', with getOpenCheckpointId() >=0

Line:1194, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Given the comment above, 'id' is strictly increasing, so 'id <= (*it)->getId()' is never verified

Line:1230, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Given the last comment, 'it == checkpointList.end()' always, so this else-block cannot be executed by logic

Line:333, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> This was the only code that led to the execution of CheckpointManager::collapseCheckpoints, which I'm removing in a follow-up patch (note from comments in CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint that in real execution we never collapseCheckpoints).

Looking at the history, the purpose of this 'reset_checkpoint_id' test is to check that the CheckpointManager::collapseCheckpoints function works properly, because calling CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint(1, ..) will collapse all the checkpoints in CM::checkpointList into one single checkpoint with (snapStart, snapEnd) = (snapStart_1, snapEnd_N)

E.g., 2 checkpoints, 1 cursor:

[Before-collapse]
| 1 2 3 | -> | 3 5|
                 ^
(snapStart_1, snapEnd_1) = (1, 3)
(sanpStart_2, snapEnd_2) = (3, 5)
----------------------------------
[After-collapse]
| 1 2 3 4 5 |
          ^
(snapStart, snapEnd) = (1, 5)

Line:1194, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> A clarification about this.

The current code is doing:
1) lock
2) newId = checkpointList.back()->getId() + 1
3) unlock
4) lock
5) execute the while-loop and modify the checkpointList
6) unlock

So in the current code is theoretically possible that 'id <= (*it)->getId()' depending on what happens to the checkpointList between 3) and 4) (e.g, maybe someone else adds a new checkpoint ?).

So with my first comment I meant that 'id > (*it)->getId()' with this change, because we do:
1) lock
2) newId = checkpointList.back()->getId() + 1
3) modify the checkpoint list
4) unlock

Obviously I'm assuming that any other thread acquires the lock before modifying the checkpointList.
