DESCRIPTION:

MB-30532: Optimize and simplify CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint

CheckpointManager::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint ("the function" from now on)
contains a lot of legacy code from TAP that is both unnecessary and
suboptimal.

a) The function takes in input the id of the new checkpoint that is
being created.
This is a legacy from TAP, when we used to synchronize checkpoints
between active and replica (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/4917/).
We don't do that with DCP. We still do active/replica synchronization,
but it is a logical synchronization on sequence-numbers rather than on
checkpoint IDs.

The function is called only by PassiveStream::handleSnapshotEnd, where:
    - we compute id=prevId+1; note that for retrieving prevId we call a
      dedicated CheckpointManager function that acquires/releases the
      CM::queueLock
    - we call CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint(id), where we acquire/release
      the CM::queueLock again

b) Given point a), the function considers the case where the
CM::checkpointList contains a checkpoint-id >= newId:
    - we scan the CM::checkpointList to find an id >= newId.
      Note: that means that the function is O(N), with N=numCheckpoints.
          That is the main cause of the regression in MB-30019, where
          the number of checkpoints is very high (up to ~50000).
    - if it exist, than we collapse all the checkpoints into one.
      This was added in MB-4707 for resolving a consistency issue.

But:
- by code inspection it seems that there is no other actor that modifies
  the CM::checkpointList for a replica vbucket consurrently with
  PassiveStream::handleSnapshotEnd. This means that checkpoint-collapsing
  is never executed in the current code for real runs
- by computing the new checkpoint id inside the function, we ensure that
  the id-sequence is strictly increasing, so we can never execute the
  collapse-path by logic

All the above allows a logical sequence of optimizations and
simplifications:
1) we can avoid acquiring/releasing the CM::queueLock twice just by
   computating the new id inside the function
2) so, we ensure that the new checkpoint id>prevId always
3) so, we don't need to scan the CM::checkpointList to check if
   id<=prevId. That means that we drop the function's complexity from
   O(N) to O(1)
4) so, we can remove the code path that performs checkpoint-collapsing,
   as we never execute it by logic
5) also, we can remove the CheckpointTest::reset_checkpoint_id test.
   That test was added in MB-7567 to check that we don't copy the
   checkpoint-end metaitems when we merge checkpoints.
   Note that checkpoint-merging is still performed as part of
   closed-checkpoint-collapsing, so I'll add a new test for
   checkpoint-merging in a follow-up patch

The optimizations at 1) and 3) (the latter in particular) help in reducing
the runtime of CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint considerably.
Here I show the results of the
perf_dcp_consumer_snap_end_mutation_latency test before and after the
optimizations above. Note that I re-introduced the regression of MB-30019
on my local environment for taking the measurements:
