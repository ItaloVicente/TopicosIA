DESCRIPTION:

MB-30532: Don't acquire the queueLock for computing the checkpoint-id

Currently in the execution of PassiveStream::handleSnapshotEnd we
acquire/release the CheckpointManager::queueLock twice:
- when getting the id of the open checkpoint for computing the newId
- when calling CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint(newId)

Given that the CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint function is called only
by PS::handleSnapshotEnd and it executes under queueLock, then we can
just compute the newId in CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint.
