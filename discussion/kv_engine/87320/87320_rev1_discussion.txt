DESCRIPTION:

MB-27376/MB-27379/MB-27380: Add IPv6 support to ep-engine CLI tools

Add support for connecting via IPv6 to the ep-engine command line
tools. Adds support to all tools which use clitool module:

* cbcompact
* cbepctl
* cbstats
* cbvbucketctl

Server hostnames can either be specified as a hostname or as a literal
IPv6 address (RFC 2732[1]), with an optional port number - the
following are all valid:

    ipv6-server-10.domain.com
    [::1]
    ip-v6-server-10.domain.com:12000
    [::1]:12000

(This is in addition to existing support for IPv4 addresses and
hostnames).

Line:63, engines/ep/management/clitool.py -> We seem to be missing the code that cast the port number to an integer for type safety.

Personally I think the following is prettier, but all very subjective.  Sure Ellis will have other opinions...


import re
import socket


def parse_address(addr):
    # Sane defaults
    family = socket.AF_UNSPEC
    port = 11210

    # Is this IPv6?
    if value.startswith('['):
        matches = re.match(r'^\[([^\]]+)\](:(\d+))?$', addr)
        family = socket.AF_INET6
    else:
        matches = re.match(r'^([^:]+)(:(\d+))?$', addr)

    # The host is the first group
    host = matches.group(1)

    # Optional port is the 3rd group
    if matches.group(3):
        port = int(matches.group(3))

    return host, port, family


print parse_address('192.168.0.1')
print parse_address('192.168.0.1:1024')
print parse_address('[fe00::]')
print parse_address('[fe00::]:1024')

Line:66, engines/ep/management/clitool.py -> What happens in the case where the FQDN resolves to a AAAA record?  We probably want to do some pydns foo here to capture that case...

Line:63, engines/ep/management/clitool.py -> Agreed about casting to int for type-safety - probably fairly evident if a mistake was made, but catching things sooner rather than later is always better. Your regex solution is certainly terser, and I like using BNF-like grammars for parsing things, but needs some extra error-handling. There are probably quite a few corner-cases that neither handles, mind. Depends on how much validation is expected - more is always better if possible, of course. This looks OK to me, though.

Line:66, engines/ep/management/clitool.py -> Depends if the script is expecting domain names rather than numerical IPs, I guess.. I suppose if one was being strict one would handle those too.

Line:66, engines/ep/management/clitool.py -> FDQN is handled inside mc_bin_client's getaddrinfo - the explicit selection of AF_INET6 here is because the user specified a numeric IPv6 address.

Line:63, engines/ep/management/clitool.py -> Good spot on the int(port) fix - I'll restore that.
