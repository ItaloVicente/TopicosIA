DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Inline cb::logtags::tagUserData

The method is so small and easy that we can just as well
keep it in the header (and as an extra bonus we can use it
directly from the other modules (like audit) without having
to add a new dependency to the utility library.

This patch also replaces the log formatting which earlier
manually inserted the <> and </> elements to use the
tag method. It was not called in the "hot path" of the
system, so it's better to have the code be clean and
use the common formatting method instead of shaving
off some us to format a debug log entry ;)

Line:710, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Note that currently in ep-engine LOG is a function not a macro; and hence doesn't check the current log level before the arguments are resolved. As such this *will* always create a temp string now.

That's probably not too bad for evictKey() - which is rarely called - but would be a problem in other places.

(All the more reason to move spdlog/fmt and use a custom formatter for User-defined data).

Line:27, utilities/logtags.h -> Can also be constexpr
