DESCRIPTION:

MB-52311: [3/n] Pause / Resume Bucket: ep-engine

Implement pause & resume support in ep-engine.

On pause(), ep-engine waits for all disk writing related tasks to
complete, inhibits any new ones from starting, and then notifies the
KVStoreIface of pause.

On resume() we do the reverse - unpause the KVStore, then allow disk
writing tasks to run again.

Note that support in KVStore for pause/resume() is not yet implemented
- see next patch in sequence.
