DESCRIPTION:

MB-43485 magma-kvstore: Prevent kvstore not-exists error from getting ignored

Magma Get() APIs return status=ok when the API call is successful. The found
flag specifically indicates whether the key is found or not. An error
code check in readLocalDoc() was ignoring not-exists error code and
treating it as successful read. This results in not able to distinguish
between a key not found vs the kvstore does not exist.
