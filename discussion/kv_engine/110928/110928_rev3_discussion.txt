DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add support for delVBucket and reset API calls

As part of this checkin, we've added a magmaKVHandle which protects
magma API calls from the vbucket being dropped. The magmaKVHandle is a
shared_ptr which is acquired at the beginning of many of the API calls.
delVBucket can't proceed in dropping the vbucket until the use_count on
the handle becomes unique().

Inside the handle is the vbstateMutex. This mutex is used to control
race conditions between updaters of the vbstate and readers of the
vbstate.
