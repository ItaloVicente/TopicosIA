DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add support for delVBucket and reset API calls

As part of this checkin, we've added a magmaKVHandle which protects
magma API calls from the vbucket being dropped. The magmaKVHandle is a
shared_ptr which is acquired at the beginning of many of the API calls.
delVBucket can't proceed in dropping the vbucket until the use_count on
the handle becomes unique().

Inside the handle is the vbstateMutex. This mutex is used to control
race conditions between updaters of the vbstate and readers of the
vbstate.

Change-Id: I9a040cd1a81e4286464891393839bd5133314a81

Patch Set 11: Code-Review-1

(9 comments)
Line:228, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> Additional comment over the last review of similar change - can this be done in a way that only magma pays the cost of having a shared_ptr in the ScanContext, create magma subclass of this object and extend it as you wish, magma-kvstore now always creates the MagmaScanContext but returns the ScanContext, inside magma you always cast back to a MagmaScanContext so you can read your kvHandle

Line:893, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> 887-893 are duplicating the same logic as 846-852, should be a function. In order to keep the lock held (at 887) std::move the lock_guard to the caller so they can continue to do their extra work with the lock held

Line:916, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> This could be simplified if the reset was done inside the construction of MagmaInfo, I'd certainly expect that if I created a MagmaInfo it would be equivalent state to calling reset on one. Then you can have a one line assignment into cachedMagmaInfo using 

  cachedMagmaInfo[] = std::make_unique<...>

Line:988, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> The above locking appears to imply that writeVBStateToDisk requires a lock on the vbucket to safely operate. You should move the locking to inside writeVBStateToDisk

Line:1083, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> This i'm sure can (and should) be const, you can still access the non-const magmaKVHandle* inside the shared_ptr, but you can't accidentally reset/increment/decerement ref counts etc...

Line:1294, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> as per earlier comment, new MagmaScanContext and construct with the kvHandle

Line:304, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Should be MagmaKVHandle

Line:307, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Make these a single vector of a pair or struct

Line:2357, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> 30 seconds is quite a long time for a unit test to run, fine for your development to gain confidence, just consider that it will run against many combinations (TSAN/Windows etc...) for many many patches, please reduce or look to structure the tests into more directed tests that attempt to overlap certain operations for much smaller periods of time, e.g. small numbers of iterations instead of real time

Line:893, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:916, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:988, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Rather than use locking to protect the retrieval of vbstate and MagmaInfo as part of the routine, I pass in copies of the vbstate and MagmaInfo to be written to the commit batch.

Line:1083, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:304, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Done

Line:307, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Done

Line:2357, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> The test does not run for 30s, it typically runs for 100-600ms depending on the speed of the machine. The 30s is a timeout in case something goes terribly wrong or the machine is incredibly slow. From my experience with other tests, they seem to use 60s as a timeout value so I thought 30s would be reasonable.
