DESCRIPTION:

Remove create-lock in the logger

The lock is pretty useless as we don't support dynamic changes
to the logger (and we would need to hold a lock in the get()
method to avoid a race during initialization where one thread
calls get() and finds that the logger isn't initialized and
goes ahead and tries to create the blachkole logger.
It would then be blocked on the lock from the other thread
initializing with the file logger. When the file logger is
created the thread release the lock and now the other thread
grabs the lock and replace the file-logger with the blackhole
logger.

(We could modify the creation of the blackhole logger to check
if the logger is initialized after grabbing the lock, but
in reality it is never true as the real use of the logger is:

    Create console logger
    do stuff
    read configuration
    replace the console logger with the file logger
    do stuff
    shut down the file logger
    exit

The blackhole logger is only used by our unit tests.
