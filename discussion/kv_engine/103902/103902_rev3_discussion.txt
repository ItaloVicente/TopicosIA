DESCRIPTION:

MB-32762: Refactor: change ADD_RESPONSE to std::function

Allows greater flexibility in how ADD_RESPONSE is implemented; not
limited to the only state being cookie.

This is used by subsequent patches to wrap ADD_RESPONSE so its memory
usage is correctly tracked.

As per ADD_STAT change, one downside of std::function compared to a
raw function pointer is it is more costly to copy. As such, also
update all the uses of ADD_STAT to pass as const reference so there's
no additional runtime cost for parameter passing.
