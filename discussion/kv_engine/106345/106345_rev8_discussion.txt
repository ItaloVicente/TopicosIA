DESCRIPTION:

MB-33739: Use raw ptr in ConnMap (and DcpConnMap) for vbConns

This should reduce cache contention on the shared_ptr as we
no longer need to acquire it (write to the ownership counter)
when we create a new seqno. Given that we were writing to the
same producer for every VB (in a 2 node test) the contetion
was extreme. The lifetime of the object is still managed by the
shared_ptr, we've only replaced weak_ptrs with raw ptrs, and on
shutdown of Consumers or Producers they remove themselves from
vbConns.

Cache contention on the shared_ptr to the DcpProducer dropped from ~5%
to ~0.5%, which is now coming from ActiveStream.

Perf stats (ops/s):
Triton Cluster - Pillowfight, 20/80 R/W, 256B binary items. 2 Nodes.

Current master - ~1,965,984 ops/s (6 run average)
With this patch - 1,992,394 ops/s (10 run average)

Code looks good - few comments to simplify.

If you haven't already - have you reviewed the reason that weak_ptrs were originally added and the tests for that?
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> contention

Line:94, engines/ep/src/connmap.cc -> Style: You could just move this to the initializer_list:

 : vbConns(engine.getConfiguration.getMaxVBuckets()),

Line:161, engines/ep/src/connmap.cc -> Style: If possible, have this take a reference which avoids the null check.

Line:179, engines/ep/src/connmap.cc -> You can simplify this and just use std::list::remove_if()

Line:73, engines/ep/src/connmap.h -> If this must be non-null, prefer a reference.

Line:125, engines/ep/src/connmap.h -> Similar here, if it's not too much refactoring  prefer std::reference_wrapper as that guarantees it's non-null.

Line:255, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Related to previous comments, these checks can all go away if you just store references.

Line:406, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Prefer remove_if

Line:60, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_dcp_conn_map.h -> This is unnecessary now - just use `c` directly - and again if you move to a reference we can avoid the null check.

Before weak_ptrs we had shared_ptrs (changed to fix ubsan issue) - http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/105086/

Before shared_ptrs we had SingleThreadedRCPtrs - 
http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/85036/

Jim recently fixed up a bunch of tests where we have a bad destruction order i.e. destructing the ConnMap before a ConnHandler -
