DESCRIPTION:

Use raw ptr in ConnMap (and DcpConnMap) for vbConns

This should reduce cache contention on the shared_ptr as we
no longer need to acquire it (write to the ownership counter)
when we create a new seqno. Given that we were writing to the
same producer for every VB (in a 2 node test) the contetion
was extreme. The lifetime of the object is still managed by the
shared_ptr, we've only replaced weak_ptrs with raw ptrs, and only
shutdown of Consumers or Producers they remove themselves from
vbConns.
