DESCRIPTION:

MB-33739: Use raw ptr in ConnMap (and DcpConnMap) for vbConns

This should reduce cache contention on the shared_ptr as we
no longer need to acquire it (write to the ownership counter)
when we create a new seqno. Given that we were writing to the
same producer for every VB (in a 2 node test) the contention
was extreme. The lifetime of the object is still managed by the
shared_ptr, we've only replaced weak_ptrs with raw ptrs, and on
shutdown of Consumers or Producers they remove themselves from
vbConns.

Line:255, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Leftover commented out code?

Line:256, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Note this probably isn't what you want - dynamic_cast to a reference will throw (std::bad_cast IIRC) if it fails, not return null. 

If you actually expect to get a type other than DcpProducer, you want to use a dynamic_cast to ptr and check for null.

Line:258, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Same

Line:256, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Oops! I did that with the others below but forgot about this one. You're right, dynamic_cast to a ref throws std::bad_cast if it fails. Changed it for safety.
