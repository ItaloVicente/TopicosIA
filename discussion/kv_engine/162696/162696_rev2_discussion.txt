DESCRIPTION:

[dcpdrain] replace bufferevent with Folly

Replace the use of bufferevents in dcpdrain with
folly as that's whats used internally within
MemcachedClient. The primary reason for doing so
is to allow to test with TLS (which we currently
can't do due with our bufferevent implementation
without a "lot" of work)
