DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Add deleteSource to StoredValue

This patch squeezes in a single bit into StoredValue to allow
ephemeral buckets to retain the information on whether the item
was expired or explicitly deleted. This functionality is required
to allow DCP expiry opcode output when backfilling on ephemeral
buckets.

Again not suggested to be put in, but a proof of concept that deleteSource can be placed into StoredValue without alarming the sizing tests

(4 comments)

General approach looks ok - couple of comments:
Line:541, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> I'd say this should be set as part of unlocked_softDelete() - we shouldn't allow "random" callers to change the deletionSource of an existing StoredValue - instead it should either be set at construction time; or as part of the action of deleting it.

Line:729, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> As previous comment; I don't think this public method should exist - you're exposing internal invariants (only deleted items should have a deleteSource) and making it possible for such invariants to be broken.

Line:731, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Can be a const method.

Line:855, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> ?
