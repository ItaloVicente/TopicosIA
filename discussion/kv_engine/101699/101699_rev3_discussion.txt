DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Add deleteSource to StoredValue

This patch adds a second bit set into StoredValue to allow
ephemeral buckets to retain the information on whether the item
was expired or explicitly deleted. This functionality is required
to allow DCP expiry opcode output when backfilling on ephemeral
buckets.

Patch Set 3:

Moved the functions to protected, and refactored the way deleteSource is stored to allow potential access without the StoredValue lock. Also removed slightly confusing description of deleteSource and how it gets interpreted

Probably worth expanding reviewers to whole team.
Line:306, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_memory.cc -> a) this is a pretty complex ternary - can we break it into say an if() / else() ?

b) This looks wrong - given StoredValue now knows why it was deleted; why are you passing it into the toItem() method?

Line:607, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> How many places to we call unlocked_softDelete()? if it' s not that many I'd suggest making this argument non-defaulted so it's more explicit exactly how an item is being deleted.

Line:106, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> other.getDeletionSource() ?

Can you also update unit tests to ensure they cover this.

Line:990, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Given this is an "internal" implementation method; it should only be called by other methods in this class; as such I think the default argument value should be removed.
