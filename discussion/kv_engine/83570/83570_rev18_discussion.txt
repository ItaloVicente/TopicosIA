DESCRIPTION:

MB-25342: Reduce map lookups by tracking the largest endSeqno

To determine if a key/seqno is deleted (which is likely to be a
frequently used function) we lookup the collection and then compare
the seqno. If we keep track of the greatest endSeqno for all collections
we can reduce the map lookups to the range of seqnos which includes
logically deleted keys, when there are no deletions occuring we will
never do a lookup at all.
