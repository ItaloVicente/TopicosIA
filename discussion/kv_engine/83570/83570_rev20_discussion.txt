DESCRIPTION:

MB-25342: Reduce map lookups by tracking the largest endSeqno

To determine if a key@seqno is logically deleted we are splitting the
key and looking up in the manifest map for the collection's metadata.

However if we track the greatest end-seqno we can

1) Only do map lookups when the key@seqno is part of the deleted range
2) Quickly determine the key is not logically deleted when no
 collections are in the deleting state, no lookups at all.
