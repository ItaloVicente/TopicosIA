DESCRIPTION:

MB-36119: Add debug info/comments to expel code

1) Add comments to expel code to explain how ordering cursors by
seqno is actually valid.

2) Replace the pre-condition with an exception to get useful debug
information should it ever fire again.

3) Order by checkpoint ID before seqno as we then don't have to worry
about the dummy item (which does not bump the seqno) when we create
a new checkpoint.

4) Make incrCursor protected as unintended use could cause cursors to
end up in invalid positions.
