DESCRIPTION:

HashTable: Refactor find...() logic to findFor{Read,Write}

+Summary+

Restructure the various find...() methods in HashTable to support
accessing Committed items even if Pending items are present. Remove
unlocked_find().

+Background+

After warmup / failover, Pending SyncWrites (which are not complete)
may already have been observed as Committed by clients:

- In the case of warmup - the same node _may_ have already notified
  the client of Commit, but the Commit may not have been persisted
  before the node restarted.

- In the case of failover - the previous active node may have already
  notified the client of Commit, but the DCP_COMMIT message never made
  it to the replica (which has subsequently been promoted).

In these cases we cannot allow clients to read the existing Commtted
value - as that could result in a client seeing an old value after the
new and breaking Sequential Consistency.

To handle this, we mark those Pending (but incomplete) SyncWrites as
"ReCommitting". Any attempt to read a key where a PendingReCommitting
SV exists should block access to the previous Committed SV with
status:ReCommittingInProgress.

This requires that the HashTable::findForRead() method is modified to
also check for a PendingReCommitting item, and return that instead of
the Committed item as it normally does. The caller must then check
that it found a PendingReCommitting and explicitly block the
access. Note this is different to not finding an item at all - it
would be invalid to even tell the client ENOENT.

However, some other uses-cases - notably warmup itself - _do_ need to
be able to call find...() and locate the Committed item (if present),
and not be re-directed to the PreparedReCommitted item. As a result we
essenitally need a 3rd way to find items, skipping the normal
ReCommitting checks.

+Changes+

Modify HashTable::find() to only perform the find of the given key -
it now returns two StoreValue*, one for each of the Pending and/or
Committed item found. Rename it to findInner() to make more explicit
this is an internal function used by other (public) find methods.

Modify HashTable::findForRead() & findForWrite() to perform the extra
logic which find used to do - checking if the user wants a deleted
item returns, and updating reference tracking if required.

This allows HashTable::insertFromWarmup() to call findInner() and
access pending and committed items directrly, regardless of any extra
checks in findFor{Read,Write}.

With the above changes, unlocked_find is now unused and can be
removed.

Note this patch _doesn't_ yet peform any checks based on ReCommitted
status - they will follow in a subsequent patch.
