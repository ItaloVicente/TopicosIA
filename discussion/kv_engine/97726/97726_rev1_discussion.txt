DESCRIPTION:

MB-30532: Improve the 'DCP Consumer snap-end mutation latency' perftest

CheckpointManager::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint is O(N),
where N = CheckpointManager::checkpointList.size().
This is the main cause of the regression in MB-30019, where the number
of checkpoints is reaches very high values (up to ~50000).

I want the perftest to catch better that scenario, so that we can
measure the optimization improvements coming with follow-up patches.

Again, I show before/after measurements with re-introducing the MB-30019
regression on my local environment.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> So you say what you want to do here; but you don't actually explain what you have changed :) - I assume increase the number of checkpoints?

Line:1181, engines/ep/tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> You can probably simplify this (removing the calls to get_failover_log() by just starting at zero - then you also don't need the UUID, as zero can be used for that.

Line:1210, engines/ep/tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> What's the overall runtime of this under Asan / TSan now (after you optimise things?)

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:1181, engines/ep/tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Yeah, I was not sure if going with the most generic way or the simplest one :) Done

Line:1210, engines/ep/tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Waiting for ASan numbers, on my local-env Debug-build it takes ~750ms after-optimize (~9 secs before-optimize :), ie this patch )
So I expect acceptable runtimes under Asan/Tsan from the next patch where we optimize, but very long runtimes here

Line:1210, engines/ep/tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Waiting is useless, this test will execute the optimized code only when we will re-introduce the changes of MB-30019 (so , only after the optimization has been completed)
I'll run Asan/Tsan on my local linux-cv
