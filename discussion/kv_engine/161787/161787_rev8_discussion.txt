DESCRIPTION:

MB-40314 Make MagmaKVStore local doc keys same as CouchKVStore

Right now local doc keys used for Magma are different from Couchstore.
Magma keys lack the "_local" prefix in them, for example:
_vbstate VS _local/vbstate

This doesn't let us use common libraries like ep-engine_storage_common
that have local doc decoders that only recognize local doc keys of
Couchstore. Hence this change makes Magma local doc keys same as
Couchstore.

Line:110, engines/ep/src/kvstore/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Looking at this again, I think this should stay as an rvalue reference.

While most of the instances where we construct a CouchLocalDocRequest take a literal (the various constants you've updated in this patch), the collection count documents (which are some of the most commonly accessed) have variable keys - as created via:

 /// @returns the document ID used to store cid
 std::string CouchKVStore::getCollectionStatsLocalDocId(CollectionID cid) {
     return fmt::format("|{:#x}|", uint32_t(cid));
 }

Given this function returns a string, we have already paid a heap allocation here[1], and if we pass the key via std::string_view we have to create a second string (with a second heap allocation in the CouchLocalDocRequest ctor.

Please change back to having this take an rvalue reference; that will probably require you to explicitly construct a std::string from your std::string_view instances:

 localDocQueue.emplace_back(std::string{LocalDocKey::vbstate}, json.dump());

Admittedly that's a bit verbose, but I think it's the best option to ensure we minimise heap allocations - there's a reason the code currently takes std::string&&.

(The obvious alternative would be to have an additional ctor overloads which take either std::string&& or std::string_view for the key. That would probably be fine if there was just a single constructor already, but there's already 3 overloads; and allowing each to take either std::string&& or std::string_view would multiply that to 6 which I feel is over-complicating things.


[1] I'm assuming here that small-string-optimization doesn't kick in, which for the specific case of the collection stats document is probably pessimistic. However the general principle holds; and we may well have other local docs in future which have longer keys.

Line:110, engines/ep/src/kvstore/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Sure, I'll refactor.

Just to understand better, wouldn't std::string also solve this issue?

For example:

 CouchLocalDocRequest(std::string key_): key(std::move(key_))

Any rvalues passed into this ctor would be move constructed into key_. Further key will be move constructed from key_. So we will only have one allocation. This also does away with the verbosity of forcing callers to create rvalues.

So we will only have one allocation. This also does away with the verbosity of forcing callers to create rvalues.

I think the problem is not really with rvalues; it's with lvalues (which may have been passed via a number functions). 

It looks like the intent with the original code was to require an rvalue(reference) - and because all users of CouchLocalDocRequest used std::string (rvalues) it all worked.

Now we have changed the constant local keys to std::string_view (which I think is a better choice in general), we do have a mix of std::string and std::string_view - and hence the debate here :)

If we don't want the complexity of the different overloads (std::string&& and std::string_view) for the most optimal way to pass in every scenario; then we need to pick one type. std::string&& essentially forces the caller to use the type we believe is the most optimal; but at the cost of the extra boilerplate if we don't already have that type...

Given the code was already using std::string&& (all arguments must be rvalue-references), that gives us a optimal calling-convention. However, using either std::string or std::string&& will now require that the std::string_view (from the constants) is explicitly converted to std::string, given there's no implicit conversion.

At the end of the day if we want to avoid copies from a std::string (rvalue or otherwise) parameter, we cannot have the constructor take a std::string_view - it must be std::string or std::string&&. And both of those require the explicit conversion.

So I think the choice is between:

a) std::string_view for the constants (and having to add explicit std::string{} to the calls, or
b) std::string for the constants, and avoiding the explicit calls.

None is ideal, but (b) to me kinda feels wrong as std::string is really for string-objects which can potentially change; which the constants cannot.

Good point.

Done. Refactored as per choice (a).

Will constants declared as `const std::string` also not suffice?

Very interesting thanks for sharing that. Got a good idea about their usages now.

Let's keep those constants as std::string_view and continue using std::string&& in the ctor. The latest patchset has those changes.

Well, it depends on how much you care about performance etc 😊

std::string is a non-constexpr class (in C++17 and consumes at least 3 words, plus a heap allocation for non-SSO).

Using `const std::string for those constants is both larger and will require the compiler to generate calls to the constructor at runtime (typically in some init function before main).

Given the issues we've hit with the ctor, I'm ok with changing the constants back to std::string for simplicity; given there are only a few and we end up turning them into std::string anyways later.

As a random example (not necessarily relevant here, but still), we have some unit tests which check all expected stat names are printed. That's done by building a unordered_map of what is returned from all the different stat groups, and comparing them to a known (constant) set of stats. I recall we used to use `const std::string` for all those stat keys (even through they are compile-time constant), and under the ASan build (which is both less optimised and performs extra work on all allocations / deallocations) we got a noticeable speedup (many seconds) in test runtime by moving to `const char*` or string_view (I forget which one).

Here you have <10 constants (there were a few hundred in that test), plus they arn't manipulated as much so it's likely to not be the same kind of issue, but I think does illustrate the kind of difference this can make in the right situation.
