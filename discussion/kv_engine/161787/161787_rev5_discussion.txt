DESCRIPTION:

MB-40314 Make MagmaKVStore local doc keys same as CouchKVStore

Right now local doc keys used for Magma are different from Couchstore.
Magma keys lack the "_local" prefix in them, for example:
_vbstate VS _local/vbstate

This doesn't let us use common libraries like ep-engine_storage_common
that have local doc decoders that only recognize local doc keys of
Couchstore. Hence this change makes Magma local doc keys same as
Couchstore.

(3 comments)
Line:34, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> We shouldn't need this (this is the old, manual way of handling includes in CMake), the particular target which needs the headers should just link to the storage_common library.

Line:110, engines/ep/src/kvstore/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Why get rid of the rvalue reference here?

(Given we are moving them into the key and value below, we avoid a copy if we use an rvalue-reference.)

Line:17, engines/ep/src/kvstore/storage_common/storage_common/local_doc_constants.h -> These don't need to be std::string as they are never modified; and there's no constexpr std::string before C++20, so you'll potentially trigger loads of heap allocations whenever they are used.

Prefer either old-school const char*, or std::string_view which is larger (2 words vs 1) but does "know" it's length (and is generally safer. Either of which is constexpr.

But the copy was still being moved into CouchLocalDocRequest::key, so there'll only be one allocation right? Only for the ctor parameter.

In case of temporaries I think ctor parameter would be move constructed, so there should not be any deallocations required?

> Alternatively, given we probably always now pass the constant keys (which are std::string_view) into this ctor then you could change the type to that 

Yup the latest patchset takes a std::string_view in the ctor.

Line:110, engines/ep/src/kvstore/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> Previously if a std::string already existed (e.g. as a temporary) then by passing as an rvalue reference no copy was required and we’d just move the string info the object. That gave worst case 1 heap allocation for the key (or zero if small-string optimisation kicked in).

Now you are forcing a copy to pass into the ctor. That plus the original allocation means two heap allocations (and possibly a deallocation if a temporary was passed in) - again assuming no SSO.

Given our memory tracking, heap allocations (esp temp short-lived ones) can be costly and cycles mount. 

If you instead pass by std::string&& then that does force one std::string to be created (from say the const string_view), but crucially we just move from that argument - meaning we are back to at most one heap allocation. 

Alternatively, given we probably always now pass the constant keys (which are std::string_view) into this ctor then you could change the type to that - they are trivially copyable (so no heap allocations on the call), with just a single heap allocation inside the object (CouchLocalDocRequest::key).

Will keep this in mind.

Line:110, engines/ep/src/kvstore/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.h -> All callers used to pass rvalues (string literals or function call return values), so this worked fine. But now since we are using our newly defined constants everywhere - which are constexpr std::string_view, we cannot avoid a copy since they are not rvalues.
