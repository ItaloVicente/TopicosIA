DESCRIPTION:

MB-37187: Cluster_test: Allow custom DCP connection setup

To allow us to test upgrade scenarios, modify the cluster_test set up
to allow fine grained control of DCP connection set up so that we can
add replication between specific nodes without SyncReplication support
to mimic a pre-MH cluster.
