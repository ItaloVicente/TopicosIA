DESCRIPTION:

MB-40734: Add new magma config parameters

This is a multi-step process to add/replace magma config parameters.

Adding new parameters:
magma_max_checkpoints - will replace magma_max_commit_points
magma_checkpoint_interval - will replace magma_commit_point_interval
magma_checkpoint_threshold
magma_heartbeat_interval
magma_max_recover_bytes

Replacing:
magma_commit_point_every_batch with magma_checkpoint_every_batch

-1 for the type issues.
Line:1070, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Note there's possibly easier way to do this - the KV-Engine configuration.json supports aliases for config params (i.e. same underlying config variable, but two or more names for it).

You could add the new config params, make the old ones be aliases to the new ones, then once everything is migrated remove the aliases in a follow-up patch.

Line:1083, engines/ep/configuration.json -> To avoid any confusion, I'd suggest keeping the default values of these config values the same during the rename; then change the defaults in a subsequent patch.

Line:55, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore_config.h -> If this a a unit of time, suggest using a suitable std::chrono type to avoid any units issues.

Line:61, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore_config.h -> ditto.

Line:1070, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Could you provide documentation on aliases? I see only 1 parameter in configuration.json which uses aliases max_size and cache_size. I don't see a getCacheSize() function for configuration so not quite sure how it all works.

Line:1083, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I can do this but it sort of goes against what I was trying to do which is introduce all the new configuration parameters and their usage in the first checkin and then remove the old with no behavioral changes being made in the second checkin. Your suggestion would introduce behavioral changes in the second checkin. So, do you still want me to make the suggested changes?

Line:55, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore_config.h -> Can you show me an example of what is desired?
I tried to find a recent config parameter that does what I think your suggesting and wasn't able to. I'm doing basically the same thing as durability_timeout_task_interval which I assume is fairly recent.

Line:55, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore_config.h -> Just change the type of magmaCheckpointInterval (and what this function returns) to std::chrono::seconds (or milliseconds if you need greater precision).

Line:1070, engines/ep/configuration.json -> As you observed, "cache_size" can be an alias for "max_size" - if ns_server attempts to set a bucket param with name "cache_size", it will change the value of "max_size". 

Therefore you can maintain compat with the existing config interface, but have two names for the same config variable.

Note theres's only one set of getXXX() / setXXX() Configuration methods generated, given the alias is an external thing.

Line:1083, engines/ep/configuration.json -> So from what I can see there's two things happening here:

a) Renaming config variables - for example "magma_checkpoint_threshold" and "magma_commit_point_interval" appear semantically the same, but you're now calling the concept in magma "checkpoint" instead of "commit_point".
b) Modifying the defaults of some values.

This to me is two conceptually different changes - (a) shouldn't change any end-user visible behaviour, whereas (b) does.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1070, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I'll reply here but it covers both comments.

There are 2 things happening at once here which has created some complexity. We are replacing commit points with checkpoints, but... we've introduced a new concept, checkpoint threshold which allows us to change the interval from 1m to 2m so its not really a strict replacement. Therefore, I think aliases only apply between MaxCommitPoints and MaxCheckpoints and between CommitPointEveryBatch vs CheckpointEveryBatch.

If I understand what your proposing with aliases, I would add an alias for MaxCheckpoint to MaxCommitPoint (and for CommitPointEveryBatch as well) and when we get rid of the old parameters, we have to essentially do all the changes that are done in this patch anyway. So, I'm trying to see the benefit of using aliases. If this were a released product and we would have to maintain these parameters over time, I get the reason for aliases. But, I don't think those reasons apply to this change.
