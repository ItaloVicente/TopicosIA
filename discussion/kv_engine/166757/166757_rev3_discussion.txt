DESCRIPTION:

MB-49782: Introduce per-stat-key getStats() timing histograms

The time taken to execute a given operation is currently recorded at a
per-opcode level.

This useful for many ops, but the time taken to execute a STAT op can
vary wildly based on the requested key.

To aid in debugging cases where KV seems to take a long time to respond
to a STAT request, this patch add timings broken down by stat key to
the "timings" group. These new histograms are not exposed for
Prometheus, as Prometheus disk usage is a concern.

Some stat keys can take arguments e.g.,

 vbucket-details 1
 collections-details 0x0

In these cases, including the argument in the stat key would lead to a
very large number of histograms, adding little additional value but
a lot of extra memory usage.

To avoid this, stat keys which may optionally take arguments are
simplified, tracking only _if_ arguments are present, rather than the
arguments themselves.

This leads to histograms like:

 stat:collections-details (11 total)
       0us - 27262ms  : (  9.0909%) 1 #############
    27262ms - 37748ms : ( 18.1818%) 1 #############
    37748ms - 41943ms : ( 27.2727%) 1 #############
    41943ms - 48234ms : ( 45.4545%) 2 ##########################
    48234ms - 50331ms : (100.0000%) 6 ##############################################################################
    Avg               : (46947ms)
 stat:collections-details:single (16 total)
       0us -   60us : (  6.2500%) 1 #########
      60us -   27ms : ( 12.5000%) 1 #########
      27ms -   28ms : ( 18.7500%) 1 #########
      28ms -   30ms : ( 37.5000%) 3 ###########################
      30ms -   32ms : ( 81.2500%) 7 ###############################################################
      32ms -   34ms : (100.0000%) 3 ###########################
    Avg             : (   30ms)

Where `collections-details` is timings for the zero-argument stat
key, which iterates all collections, and `collections-details:single`
reflects the one-argument stat key, addressing a single collection.

Line:610, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> std::map insertion doesn't invalidate any iterators or references, unordered_map may (if it causes rehashing) and F14 too (sanitizers spot heap-use-after-free).
map also has hetrogeneous lookup, which is handy.

Could flip to using either of the others, and reserve() an appropriate amount but that feels semi-dodgy.
Thinking this through to see if we could reserve() some large enough value and guard it has raised another slight issue - if a user spams invalid keys

 cbstats raw asdfasdfasdfasdf

useless histograms will accumulate in the map.

Line:610, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> another alternative being to add a new stopwatch class which can hold a read lock while it uses the histogram. Possibly also then want it to not acquire it until stop() and only get the histogram then to avoid holding the read lock for the whole span for not much reason

Line:610, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> Yeah, I did think about how the stopwatches currently work; I don't think any of them really rely on knowing the start time at the point we start our measurement - i.e. at most they just need to know start & end once the event has been timed.

However that's a reasonable refactor of the stopwatch stuff and not directly related to this work here.

In terms of the map locking etc, strictly speaking using a dynamic structure like a map / unordered_map is unnecessary - we only have a fixed-at-compile-time set of stats keys we want to record histograms for.

We could simply have an array of Histogram objects indexed by an enum or similar. That would avoid _all_ locking I believe, given HdrHistogram class itself is lock-free.

WIth respect to the point about invalid keys - we certainly shouldn't be logging timings for those, which probably means you need to move the histogram timer further down the call-stack.

Any reason why we push the logic down in the engine and don't do it all the way up in the "core" so that it works for all different stat groups?
