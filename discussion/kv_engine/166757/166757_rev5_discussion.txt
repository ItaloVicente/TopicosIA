DESCRIPTION:

MB-49782: Introduce per-stat-key getStats() timing histograms

The time taken to execute a given operation is currently recorded at a
per-opcode level.

This useful for many ops, but the time taken to execute a STAT op can
vary wildly based on the requested key.

To aid in debugging cases where KV seems to take a long time to respond
to a STAT request, this patch add timings broken down by stat key under
a new "stat-timings" group. These new histograms are not exposed for
Prometheus, as the resulting disk usage would likely exceed the value
of having these stats recorded over time.

Some stat keys can take arguments e.g.,

 vbucket-details 1
 collections-details 0x0

In these cases, including the argument in the stat key would lead to a
very large number of histograms, adding little additional value but
a lot of extra memory usage.

To avoid this, stat keys which may optionally take arguments are
simplified, tracking only _if_ arguments are present, rather than the
arguments themselves.

This leads to histograms like:

 stat:collections-details (11 total)
       0us - 27262ms  : (  9.0909%) 1 #############
    27262ms - 37748ms : ( 18.1818%) 1 #############
    37748ms - 41943ms : ( 27.2727%) 1 #############
    41943ms - 48234ms : ( 45.4545%) 2 ##########################
    48234ms - 50331ms : (100.0000%) 6 ##############################################################################
    Avg               : (46947ms)
 stat:collections-details:single (16 total)
       0us -   60us : (  6.2500%) 1 #########
      60us -   27ms : ( 12.5000%) 1 #########
      27ms -   28ms : ( 18.7500%) 1 #########
      28ms -   30ms : ( 37.5000%) 3 ###########################
      30ms -   32ms : ( 81.2500%) 7 ###############################################################
      32ms -   34ms : (100.0000%) 3 ###########################
    Avg             : (   30ms)

Where `collections-details` is timings for the zero-argument stat
key, which iterates all collections, and `collections-details:single`
reflects the one-argument stat key, addressing a single collection.

Line:754, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> I don't think we should include the time taken to write the stats out in the timing (i.e. you're including the time for the append_stats() call) - given we only start the stopwatch once we have decided what stat group to invoke (we don't include the network read cost).

Line:28, daemon/stat_timings.cc -> Do we actually need to take the creation mutex when calling reset? We probably don't want to block another thread reading (or accounting a STATs call) while this thread is resetting.

Line:61, daemon/stat_timings.h -> Suggest we add a "memFootprint()" method  similar to other classes of this ilk so we can get a sense of how much memory these histograms consume.

Line:84, daemon/stat_timings.h -> Nit: You're repeating the type with lines 73. Nicer to declare a type alias and only write once.

Line:754, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> that last append_stats call immediately above could be excluded by shuffling calls here, but in general it doesn't seem straightforward to avoid including the time taken by append_stats.

When adding stats

 collection.addStat(Key::foo, bar)

that immediately calls the provided

 addStatFn

which typically _is_ appendStatsFn/append_stats

If we really want to exclude that, we could separately track the time spent in append_stats and subtract that (seems costly, lots of now() calls), or change the collector to buffer all the stats, then actually call append_stats on each of them later (but that seems costly in terms of memory usage, especially for large groups like collections-details).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:754, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> Ah ok, I hadn't trigged that the append_stats() above is just the terminal one.

Fine to leave as-is.
