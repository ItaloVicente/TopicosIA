DESCRIPTION:

MB-32577 Fix crash during rebalance by block DCP during warmup

Fix crash during rebalance (MB-32577), caused by us allowing DCP
consumer connections during warmup. To fix this we now return
ENGINE_TMPFAIL till we have fully warmedup. This commit also
adds a unit test to check that we block DCP during warmup and
that once fully warmed up we can correctly send delete requests
to a DCP consumer.

Update stream-request.mb documentation to explain when
PROTOCOL_BINARY_RESPONSE_ETEMPFAIL (0x86) is returned.

Update ep_engine.cc to have more info logging about when
traffic is enabled to ep-engine.

Code looks good - just a couple of minor things:
Line:2511, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Don't really understand this comment - could you clarify?

Line:2516, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> I vaguely recall that multiple callers might attempt to set this - for example multiple warmup shard tasks. As such we might end up with log spam for all but the first caller (which does manage to set the atomic).

Suggest you just print the log message when the enableTraffic is successful.
