DESCRIPTION:

MB-32577 Fix crash during rebalance by block DCP during warmup

Fix crash during rebalance (MB-32577), caused by us allowing DCP
consumer connections during warmup. To fix this we now return
ENGINE_DISCONNECT till we have fully warmedup. This commit also
adds a unit test to check that we block DCP during warmup and
that once fully warmed up we can correctly send delete requests
to a DCP consumer.

Test and fix generally looks good. Just a couple of tweaks.
Line:5599, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> accept

Line:5607, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> I think as written this gives a slightly misleading warning - we'll print the "failed to create a handler" message in the case where we haven't warmed up yet.

Also we're returning the "wrong" status code - ENGINE_DISCONNECT (which is later translated into actually disconnecting the stream) instead of TMPFAIL which is what we use elsewhere when in the middle of warming up.

Once you've added ETMPFAIL can you also update the DCP documentation (stream-request.md) to document this new status code usage.

Line:417, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> Please add a brief description describing what this test is for.

Line:426, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> old ?

Line:505, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> This shouldn't happen now, right? Have a look at EXPECT_NOTHROW() which is probably the correct thing to use here.
