Line:23, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> No, other classes use log here (it's public and was before). Done for passive and notifier streams

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:23, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> Ok. 

So I think I see a way to solve the inter-dependancy problem here - it's not super clean but it does remove the need for producer.h in this file (and hence anyone else who #includes active_stream.h):

* Split the declaration and definition of log<>(); moving the definition to a new file: active_stream_impl.h.
* For any files which need to call ActiveStream::log() (only ones seem to be backfill*.cc), they must also include "active_stream_.h".


This managed to decouple active_stream.h from producer.h; it's not perfect as callers of particular template instantiations of log() need to remember to include an extra header; but I think it's worth the compromise.

Probably also worth a comment next to the declaration of log() saying the definition if needed is in active_stream_impl.h

Feel free to make this change in a follow-up patch.
