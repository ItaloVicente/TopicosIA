Convert DCP Logger objects to instances of the BucketLogger
throughout.

Remove old Logger objects within DCP code.

The scripts "fixpointlessmacros.py" and "simplifyLogCalls.py"
in the repository https://github.com/BenHuddleston/Misc-Scripts
were used to make these changes.

Line:555, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> As a general comment, there appears to be unnecessary whitespace (wrapping) in a number of the places you've updated the log messages. What tool(s) are you using to set this wrapping, or is clang-format just doing this?

Line:201, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> I think it's best to move this back into the subclasses which require it. 

While it's true that the current subclasses of Stream refer to a connHandler; that essentially dictating implementation into an interface; and mixing a base-class-as--an-interface with a base-class-as-shared-common-code. See the guidance at http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rh-kind and children guidelines.

In concrete terms, while this change means that the subclasses of stream don't need to include connhandler.h; we *have* essentially polluted this file with headers which users of it don't necessarily need (conn handler.h; spdlog/common.h). It also means that the subclasses don't have the correct, concrete type of the connection they refer do; and only have a pointer to the base class (ConnHandler) which increases the need for dynamic cast and similar.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:555, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Let's leave for now; not sure it's worth going over again in this series of patches.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:555, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> The first carriage return is an oversight in the script I wrote to edit the macros in the first place, as we previously had the severity parameter. I could fix all occurrences in a new patch.

Formatting beyond that is maintained from what it was before, or modified when clang-format runs.
