DESCRIPTION:

Create McProgramGetopt

All of the mc programs use the same subset of options to configure
a connection to the server. To avoid having to duplicate this logic
to all of the tools this patch introduce a common "class" they
may use to parse command line arguments (and look up hostname,
get password from console or environment variable etc).
