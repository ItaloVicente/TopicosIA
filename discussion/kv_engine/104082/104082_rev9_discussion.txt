DESCRIPTION:

MB-32591: Nullify duplicate entries in checkpoint queue

Instead of erasing the duplicate item pointers from the CheckpointQueue
we set them to null.

This is in preparation for when we move the CheckpointQueue
implementation over from a std:list to a std:deque, and so cannot
easily erase individual items out of the data-structure.

When we use the CheckpointIterator to iterate over the queue it
automatically skips over these null pointer elements.
