DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor] Reduce duplication of boilerplate code

Cast the CookieIface to MockCookie in the callback methods
to handle the ewb logic.

Rename the overloaded cookie_to_mock_cookie which took a
reference and returned a reference to asMockCookie to ease
readability for the difference between them (and we want
to migrate off all of the pointer functions as the cookie
cannot be nullptr)
