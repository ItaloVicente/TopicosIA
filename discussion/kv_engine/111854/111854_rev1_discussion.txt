DESCRIPTION:

MB-34946: Use HashTable::FindCommitResult in processSet

In a following change, we need to make use of the FindCommitResult
in VBucket::processSet as it contains both the pending and
committed StoredValues. To keep a single processSet interface,
update all callers to pass a FindCommitResult instead of a single
StoredValue*.
