DESCRIPTION:

MB-26849 [RocksDB] Avoid data races caused by 'delVBucket'

As we cannot create multiple RocksDB instances on the same DB,
RocksDBKVStore keeps a vector of handle for the opened DBs. Previously,
that handle was a unique_ptr. That allowed 'delVBucket' to release the
handle of a live DB (e.g., a DB used but in a 'set' execution).
With this change we model DB handles as shared_ptr, and we release a DB
handle in 'delVBucket' only when the reference count of the shared_ptr
is equal 1.
