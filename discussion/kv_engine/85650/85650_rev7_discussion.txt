DESCRIPTION:

MB-26849 [RocksDB] Avoid data races caused by 'delVBucket'

As we cannot create multiple RocksDB instances on the same DB,
RocksDBKVStore keeps a vector of handles for the opened DBs. Previously,
an handle was a unique_ptr. That allowed 'delVBucket' to release the
handle of a live DB (e.g., a DB used in a 'commit' execution).
With this change we model DB handles as shared_ptr, and we release a DB
handle in 'delVBucket' only when the reference count of the shared_ptr
is equal 1.

It would also be ideal if you could create a unit test which demonstrates the problem (call open / delvBucket in one thread, call stats in the other thread).
Line:544, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Worth expanding this - explain *why* we spin waiting until we are the exclusive owner here (because this is an expensive operation and we want it to happen in this thread).

I would also suggest adding a comment to the function prototype, explaining this is a blocking call which waits until other threads have finished with a vb before it completes.

Line:549, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> This is probably too long to wait - that's 1/10 of a second. Better to reduce it to say 100 microseconds.

Line:623, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Incorrect naming style.

Line:299, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> A const shared_ptr is probably not what you want - see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-sharedptrparam-owner (and the following rules) for when you should use the different variants of a shared_ptr.

In this instance (and similar other protected/private methods in this class) you should just pass a reference to KVRocksDB, as there's already a parent caller function which owns or "holds onto" the lifetime of the stared_ptr - see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-smartptrparam

This is a good presentation on this area in general which I recommend reading / watching the YouTube video:

Line:308, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.h -> Might be worth clarifying the usage of this now. I believe one only needs to hold the mutex while they take a copy of the shared_ptr from the vector (i.e in openDB), or if an element is added or removed. Once a thread has it's own copy of the shared_ptr the mutex can be unlocked.
