In which case I suggest rewording the commit message. As it stands, I read it as you have moved code to the destructor in this patch.

I can see that ;) (the code in the destructor would never release the stuff as it was already released.. after this patch the destructor will now do the release and that was what I was thinking about when I wrote the commit message...
