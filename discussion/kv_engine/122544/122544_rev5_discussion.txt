DESCRIPTION:

MB-37959: Delay stats privilege check to the command executor

The stats command is protected with two different privileges:

The `SimpleStats` privilege allows for requesting basic statistics
information from the system (restricted to the selected bucket)

The `Stats` privilege allows for requesting all the statistics
information in the system (system configuration, vbucket state,
dcp information etc) (bucket specific information also require
the SimpleStats privilege).
