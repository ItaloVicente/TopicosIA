DESCRIPTION:

MB-46738: Rename dcp_conn_buffer_ratio into dcp_consumer_buffer_ratio

Naming's particularly important here.

The param controls the limit of buffers that are allocated only at DCP
Consumer.
That is part of our DCP Flow Control implementation. If OOM, the
Consumer starts buffering messages rather than processing them, which
also means that the Consumer doesn't ack bytes back to the Producer.

IMPORTANT: The param doesn't have any direct effect on buffer sizing at
Producer.
