DESCRIPTION:

MB-52728: StatsCommandContext: Handle bucket_get_stats() returning EWouldblock

Verify that the background tasks which perform budket-level STAT
requests correctly handle async notificaiton - prior to the fix for
this MB we could end up calling notifyIoComplete *twice* for a single
engine API call (there should only be one).

This manifested as intermittent failures in subsequent commands if the
same Cookie was reused - which was typically the case if running in
in-order mode.
