DESCRIPTION:

MB-30247: Force Process pending notifications on StreamTest::TearDown

The MB backtrace shows an UBSan error because a chain of destruction is
'recursive'.

Here's the flow:

1) The engine destruction destroys the DcpConnMap
2) DcpConnMap destructs ConnMap (it's parent)
3) If ConnMap::pendingNotificationsQueue is emptied and can destroy the
 ConnHandler objects it references, but only if the shared_ptr count is
 just right.
4) A DcpProducer destructs and destroys it's backfill-manager
5) The backfill manager destructor accesses the DcpConnMap, which was
 destroyed at step 1, it's no longer technically a valid DcpConnMap and
 the warning is raised.

Fix:
In StreamTest::TearDown explicitly call processPendingNotifications so
the destructor path can't hit this chain of events.
