DESCRIPTION:

MB-30247: Use weak_ptr in non owning ConnMap containers

The MB backtrace shows an UBSan error because a chain of destruction is
'recursive'.

Here's the flow:

1) The engine destruction destroys the DcpConnMap
2) DcpConnMap destructs ConnMap (it's parent)
3) If ConnMap::pendingNotificationsQueue is emptied and can destroy the
 ConnHandler objects it references, but only if the shared_ptr count is
 just right.
4) A DcpProducer destructs and destroys it's backfill-manager
5) The backfill manager destructor accesses the DcpConnMap, which was
 destroyed at step 1, it's no longer technically a valid DcpConnMap and
 the warning is raised.

To fix this recursive chain, the ConnMap::pendingNotificationsQueue and
ConnMap::vbConns containers should hold weak_ptrs and obtain the real
shared_ptr via lock(), this breaks the cycle, shut down paths should
no longer be able to allow a DcpProducer::backfillManager to touch the
destructed DcpConnMap

Validation:

Reverting the engine->getDcpConnMap().processPendingNotifications();
added by 14dc7321 exposes some tests to the same cycle, and they were
seeing a use-after-free error (under ASAN). Next an explicit
dcpConnMap_.reset(nullptr) was temporarily added to the engine DTOR so
those tests segfaulted and allowed the weak_ptr update to be validated.

If it's problematic to address the issues with removal from vb_conns we could probably just keep that as a shared_ptr for now - I think as long as pending... uses weak_ptr the bug at hand should be addressed...
Line:181, engines/ep/src/connmap.cc -> Not sure how much it matters, but if the weak_ptr can't be locked (i.e. ConnHandler has been deleted) we should probably remove it from `vb_conns` anyway (even if the cookie doesn't match) to avoid clogging up vb_conns with dead connections.

Line:403, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Similary here.
