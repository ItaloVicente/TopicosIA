DESCRIPTION:

MB-30247: Force processPendingNotifications on StreamTest::TearDown

The MB backtrace shows a UBSan error because a chain of destruction can
be 'recursive'.

Here's the flow:

1) The engine destruction destroys the DcpConnMap
2) DcpConnMap destructs ConnMap (its parent)
3) If ConnMap::pendingNotificationsQueue is emptied it can destroy the
 ConnHandler objects it references, but only if the shared_ptr count is
 just right.
4) A DcpProducer destructs and destroys its backfill-manager
5) The backfill-manager destructor accesses the DcpConnMap, which was
 destroyed at step 1, it's no longer technically a valid DcpConnMap and
 the warning is raised.

Fix:

In StreamTest::TearDown explicitly call processPendingNotifications 
(so the AtomicQueue is empty) and the destructor path can't hit this 
chain of events.
