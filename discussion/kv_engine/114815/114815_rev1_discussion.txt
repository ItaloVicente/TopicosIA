DESCRIPTION:

MB-35937: Don't auth check an already authenticated blocking command

It's possible to authenticate and begin to execute command which first
returns "would block", then find that after notifyIOComplete wakes the
command to finish authentication is no longer possible. This happens in
the jepsen test case when ns_server is forcefully terminated and results
in kv-engine leaving the engine-specific with data from the first
execution of the now failed blocking command, which results in a
subsequent new command appearing to succeed (as it observes the
engine-specific data).

To address this issue, update the Cookie object to track when
authentication was successful, so the post io-complete execution of the
command can proceed.
