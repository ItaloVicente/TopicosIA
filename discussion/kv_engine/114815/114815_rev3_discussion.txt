DESCRIPTION:

MB-35937: Don't auth check an already authenticated blocking command

It's possible to authenticate and begin to execute a command that first
returns "would block". Later when notifyIOComplete wakes the command to
finish, the exeuction is re-authenticated, but authentication is no
longer possible. This happens in the jepsen test case when ns_server is
forcefully terminated, resulting in kv-engine leaving the
engine-specific with data from the first execution of command. The final
outcome is that a subsequent new command appears to succeed because it
sees the engine-specific is set, the subsequent command has actually
made no changes to the vbucket.

To address this issue, update the Cookie object to track when
authentication was successful, so the post io-complete execution of the
command can proceed.

I can't find a suitable test-suite which would allow coverage here? I would need to be able to  drive the memcached statemachine against a real engine.

Hmm. Could we use ewouldblock_engine to inject an EWOULDBLOCK status code at the "wrong" time  - or if not a more custom ewouldblock mode?

I have a couple of questions to this (I'll take them offline in slack)... It should probably be authorized and not authenticated?
Line:856, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> should probably authorized? and not authenticated?

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> perhaps a better fix is to reset engineStorage in part of cookie::reset() / initialize()

Spoke to Trond on slack...

I wasn't keen on the reset approach because the command has been authorised and may have done a lot of work to get to the notifyIOComplete stage (e.g. contacting all replicas and managing the sync-write ACKs) only to then be failed for authorization (which had previously passed).

GET with a bgfetch also suffers in that we may have held the command for some time, done the fetch and then just fail it, when we could complete it.
