Line:731, programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc -> Given this is all in process, you could just run the test with `-v` and have it print to stdout. When run via CTest it has the nice feature of ignoring stdout for tests which pass, but will print it if the test fails (--output-on-failure). For example when run via CV we pass this flag.

That means we get output for _all_ test programs if they fail, not just the ones we have explicitly modified like this.

I believe the engine_testapp suites already run with `-v` when executed via ctest, so we already have _all_ the program's output for failed test when run via Jenkins CV.

If you want to get this info locally simply run ctest with --output-on-failure. You can also enable this by default via https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE.html#envvar:CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE

Line:731, programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc -> Each ep_testsuite testsuite is seen as an individual test by CTest. If _any_ of the tests contained within fails, the output from the entire engine_testapp execution is printed (if --output-on-failure or -v is used). 

If we default engine_testapp to run with verbose logging, this has the effect that debug logs are generated for all tests (success or failure) and then if any single tests fails, at the end of the engine_testapp's execution, CTest just dumps the entire output from all tests which ran. This ouput is not very legible, which is why I've taken this approach. 

With this change, only the 100 most recent log lines from the failing test are printed.

True, but as mentioned above this is a bespoke change which only solves the engine_testapp suite. 

Note this is one of the few remaining suites which doesn't use GTest to drive it, which is arguably the higher-level problem here. If we want to spend effort making engine_testapp more usable, I think migrating it over to driven by GTest is overall a better win - it gives us the per-test logging which that does, plus all the filtering, richer asserts, etc that has.

It also suffers from the classic "oh, but what if 100 lines aren't sufficient?" problem - you've introduced a second way to achieve something which while it might be easier for 80% of the cases, it increases the overall complexity of the test harness.

... having said all that, given you've already made the change and it only affects test harness code, I'm ok to put it in, but I think any future enhancements should be in the direction of moving to GTest :)
