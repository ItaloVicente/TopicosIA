DESCRIPTION:

MB-24461: Use unique_item_ptr in mcbp connection

This patch replaces the void* previously used with a unqiue_item_ptr so
that the upcoming change to the bucket_get is worthwhile.

In order to do this I have allowed an ItemDeleter to be have a default
constructor as the engine is not know to the connection upon it's
creation.

From the code it looks like subdoc is the only user of the member after the refactor.. what about keeping the item inside the subdoc context object instead (like we do for retrieval and mutation commands)?
Line:759, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> I don't think this is true anymore? "in the new world" we always read the entire packet before doing anything
