DESCRIPTION:

MB-31481: Force InMemory case of notifyStreamReady

When a takeover is created and the data is 100% from backfill, along
with a slow stream trigger the stream end message gets stuck in the
readyQ as the stream is never notified as ready to send it. As the
stream transitions state to InMemory as well as having sent all
requested sequence numbers, the stream is meant to end but
Stream::itemsReady can cause this to never trigger. This means that DCP
consumers can hang waiting for this closure message.

This patch sets force to true inside notifyStreamReady when triggered
from InMemory and intending on ending the stream. This ensures that
the stream is notified no matter what the itemsReady flag is set to.
The patch also includes a test to follow this problematic sequence.

The commit message has also been updated to clarify the situation, as well as the linked MB being much more specific.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's not a takeover stream, whoops. Needs to change.
