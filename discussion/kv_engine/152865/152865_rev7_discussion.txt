DESCRIPTION:

[testapp] Don't register McdEnvironment with GTest

GTest tries to remove the object in an atexit handler which
means that we really don't know how far in the shutdown
logic of the process we've come.

Call mcd_env->terminate(exitcode) instead of exit() to make
sure that we also clean up the test directory after failures.
