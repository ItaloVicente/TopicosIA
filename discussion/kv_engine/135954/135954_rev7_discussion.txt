DESCRIPTION:

MB-38428: Allow compaction and flusher in parallel

WIP

We're compacting the current database file into the new file
without holding any locks. The thread performing the compaction
holds the file open so it can't go away while it is traversing
the data in there, and it knows where in the file the "current"
header is located so it also knows where to stop reading data.

Once all of the data up to the "current" header is written it'll
grab the lock and append the mutations which happened after
compaction started.
