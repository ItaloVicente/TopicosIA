DESCRIPTION:

MB-37387: Remove support for QuitQ

The command has not been used from any SDK, and it has a limited
use (you only save 24 bytes in return when the connection shuts
down, and it is impossible to distinguish between a clean shutdown
or an error happening earlier in the pipeline causing the connection
to be killed).
