DESCRIPTION:

MB-50383: End DCP legacy stream if default coll highSeqno is not visible

Problem:
MB-50383 demonstrated if a vbucket had no items in the default
collection due to following steps, we would fail the DCP stream instead
of returning a DcpStreamEnd with the flag set to status OK.

1. Create a second collection
2. Write a key to default collection and flush it
3. Delete the key in the default collection and flush
4. Write a key to second collection and flush
5. Perform compaction on the vbucket

We will fail the stream as the high seqno vbucket is in the second
collection, which means we will allow the dropping of tombstone of step
3. This would then cause us to fail the backfill and set the stream to
dead due to KVStore::getBySeqno() return cb::engine_errc::no_such_key as
the tombstone has been purged.

Fix:
Instead of failing back fill in
DCPBackfillBySeqnoDisk::markLegacyDiskSnapshot() due to
KVStore::getBySeqno() returning cb::engine_errc::no_such_key, we should
instead continue to in the markLegacyDiskSnapshot() method and perform a
backfill to try and find the highest valid tombstone or alive document
that can be streamed to the client.

Also in the situation that the scan covers the full range of the DCP
stream i.e. the stream's streanEndSeqno == backfillEndSeqno. Then check
check if the endSeqno is greater than the maxVisableSeqno for the
default collection. As if this is the case we'll need to send a
DcpStreamEnd to the client. To do this we'll reduce the current
streamEnd to the maxVisableSeqno of the default collection that we found
when performing the scan of the vbucket on disk.

(7 comments)
Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Needs to be a compaction that purges the tombstone created at step 3. I.e. enough time has passed or we do a compaction with drop_deletes=true

Line:2333, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> I'd rename this function setEndSeqno as that's all it does

Line:413, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> I thought this comment was quoting the variable name in the following if statement, so changing the comment but not the variable name is now confusing? Maybe just revert this line?

Line:446, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> "has been tombstone purged" is probably clearer

Line:538, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> what happens if this statement is removed, I didn't quite get why we need to lower the end-seqno? Won't this miss in-memory items that are > cb.maxVisisbleSeqno but < requested end?

Line:892, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_legacy_dcp_tests.cc -> do you mean "tombstone at seqno:5 will be purged?"

Line:950, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_legacy_dcp_tests.cc -> purged

Line:538, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> If there are items to read from memory (endSeqno == stream.getEndSeqno()) will be false. As the endSeqno represents the end of the backfill range. So we're just comparing if there are non visible seqno's between the max visible seqno and the backfill range. I'll add a comment here and maybe reactor endSeqno to make this easier to see.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:538, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_by_seqno_disk.cc -> Ok, gotcha, re-read the ActiveStream code and makes more sense. In terms of the new code comment "maxVisibleSeqno is less than the streamEnd" should that comment be changed to "maxVisibleSeqno is less than the backfill end" ? i.e. i'm reading "streamEnd" to be "stream.getEndSeqno()"

The if statement be clearer (match comment) like this (so you use <) 

if (endSeqno == stream.getEndSeqno() && cb.maxVisibleSeqno < endSeqno)
