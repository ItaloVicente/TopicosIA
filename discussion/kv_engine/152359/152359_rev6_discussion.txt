DESCRIPTION:

MB-45756: Expand the logging in PDM when we throw a logic exception

There are a few places in the Passive Durability Monitor that we throw
std::logic_error exceptions, these get caught and logged by our front
end code. However, these are only logged at a warning level to keep
noise down for exceptions that are thrown due to invalid args or are not
hard errors. However, this means that we sometimes might miss the fact
that the PDM has hit an error during testing as quite often the logs are
grepped for just ERROR or CRITICAL level logs.

To fix this, log with error level message before throwing the
exception. Also if we receive a commit out order add extra information
to the log message to tell us if there is a prepare that is being
tracked for the commits key and if so what seqno it has. Plus log
information around the current HPS, HCS and last seen snapshot end.

Line:211, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> I'm not sure this extra logging is the correct way to address this issue, for a couple of reasons:

a) This code is guarded with CB_DEVELOPMENT_ASSERTS, as such you arn't point to see _any_ of it in production builds.
b) If the top-level catch block in front-end threads catches _any_ exception, that's probably something worth examining. If we aren't spotting that right now because it's reporting at warning, that to me suggests it is at the wrong level for _all_ such exceptions, and we should reported at error.

(Ditto for other extra log messages).

Line:211, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Point B I'm checking with Trond to see if there's as specific reason to why this is the case I thought it might have been due to inalid_arg expectations but better to check :).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:211, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> I've spoke to Trond about the log level of exceptions caught by the Connection object and raised a patch to move them log at error level.
