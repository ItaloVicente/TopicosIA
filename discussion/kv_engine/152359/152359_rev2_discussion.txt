DESCRIPTION:

MB-45756: Expand the logging in PDM when we throw a logic exception

There are a few places in the Passive Durability Monitor that we throw
std::logic_error exceptions, these get caught and logged by our front
end code. However, these are only logged at a warning level to keep
noise down for exceptions that are thrown due to invalid args or are not
hard errors. However, this means that we sometimes might miss the fact
that the PDM has hit an error during testing as quite often the logs are
grepped for just ERROR or WARNING level logs.

To fix this log before an error level message before throwing the
exception. Also if we receive a commit out order add extra information
to the log message to tell us if there is a prepare that is being
tracked for the commits key and if so what seqno it has. Plus log
information around the current HPS, HCS and last seen snapshot end.
