DESCRIPTION:

MB-41234: Decrement stats.daemon_conns in destructor

daemon_conns reflects the number of daemon connections created in
the system. It goes back to the community memcached days when
it was used to figure out how many actual connections the system
had as curr_conns include both clients and server sockets causing
people to ask questions on the forum on why curr_conns was != 0
after startup. (A better alternative back in the days would have
been to not increment curr_conns as part of creation of daemon
connections and have clients add in them to figure the total
amount of connection structures allocated).

To make the code easier to follow move the counter as a static member
in the class it keep track of.
