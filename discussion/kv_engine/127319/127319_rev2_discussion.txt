DESCRIPTION:

MB-37319: Add PiTR knowledge to ActiveStream

This patch populates the knowledge of the PiTR enabled feature
for the DCP producers down to the ActiveStream class and initialize
the Scan Context requesting a historical snapshot if enabled.

Currently the underlying kvstore "ignores" this and gives the
current data (as the code to open a historical snapshot is moved
to a separate patch to minimize the changeset and ease the review).
