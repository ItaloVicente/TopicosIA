Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I'm a little nervous of this change - the notify code is petty central to the performance of any operations requiring notification (BGfetches and DCP). 

Do we need to maintain a vector of Cookies for each Connection, or could we keep it simple and just have the pendingIO "list" maintain the connections which have /some/ work pending, and have the Connection itself determine which Cookie(s) need to be serviced next?

Either way, I think we want to check the performance numbers with this change.

The thing is that we can't update the cookie until it is serviced as part of the runloop for the connection.

In the "normal" situation this will be a vector of 1 entry, and when running OOO it'll be a vector up to the number of operations we allow to operate on in parallell

Ok. Suggest we make sure this is in a build by itself so we can see what effect (if any) this has on showfast daily perf.
