DESCRIPTION:

MB-26105 [RocksDB] Expose all DB Options

RocksDB provides a number of Database internal parameters available for
customization. With this change we expose all of them for tuning.
Now we can set the default value for all Options in the ep-engine
`configuration.json` file. Also, we can amend them at runtime for tests
through the `-e "<config>"` command-line argument.
This patch introduces the new configuration options `rocksdb_options`
and `rocksdb_cf_options`. We have removed the previous
`rocksdb_write_buffer_size`, `rocksdb_db_write_buffer_size` and
`rocksdb_max_write_buffer_number options`, which are now included in the
new ones.

Line:57, engines/ep/src/kvstore_config.cc -> I don't think removing 4 characters makes much difference to the length; but it does hurt readability quite a bit:  `rocksDBCFOpt` just looks like a string of random letters towards the end ;)

Suggest you keep the original name.

Line:66, engines/ep/src/kvstore_config.cc -> Aha - I guess you renamed them to avoid name collisions with the member variable name. This isn't necessary - name resolution rules mean it's fine to use the same name for a parameter as a member variable - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/268587/can-i-use-identical-names-for-fields-and-constructor-parameters
