DESCRIPTION:

MB-52054: Only write to stats.json on shutdown & warmup

We don't use the stats data in stats.json, so we don't need to record
stats data periodically, using the StatSnap task. Instead just record
the keys 'ep_force_shutdown' & 'ep_shutdown_time' during shutdown and
warmup. Which allows us to save time collecting stats data and
generating the json data.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think you can also remove StatSnap taskId. 
Line:1239, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Style: Not that it really matters for a small JSON like this, but you could just construct the nlohmann::json object in a single statement:

 const nlohmann::json snapshotStats = {
   {"ep_force_shutdown", stats.forceShutdown},
   {"ep_shutdown_time", fmt.format("{}", ep_real_time())}
 };
