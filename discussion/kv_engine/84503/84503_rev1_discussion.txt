DESCRIPTION:

MB-26218: Don't generate NMVB response packet from the engine

This duplicates the logic for the content of the NMVB packet
being created. Instead the engine should return the standard
error code, and the core will correctly generate the error
message in the standard location.

The problem this patch fix was that as part of refactoring
out the method method to generate the NMVB would format
and move the response into the send buffer, except that
due to the return code from the the underlying engine
the core thought that the engine had modified the send
buffer. This buffer turned out to be empty (since it was
already "moved"), and the core would skip sending the
data.

@Daniel: I ran the test you suggested and I'm getting the following in the logs on the server :-)

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> double "method" :)

Line:593, engines/ep/tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> I'm not sure about this "dual mode" nature of this function - I think it is potentially confusing / error-prone having it behave in different ways.

I think it would be preferred if we just had it do one thing - say return the status code it got; and have the caller check as appropriate.

I think the response is now create - as it no longer hangs, as its giving a response (not_my_vbucket) back to ns_Server

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:593, engines/ep/tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> I wanted to "minimise" the patch and figured that this was the least intrusive way to do that (so that I only had to change the few places where I actually needed the function to fail).. I created MB-26424 which would probably affect all of these so it would probably be just as good to pospone "fixing" this to just use a return value then?  or?

Line:593, engines/ep/tests/ep_test_apis.cc -> Using a return value would be ideal if you want to make that change; another option would be be pass in an expected_result (defaulting to ENGINE_SUCCESS) which would minimise the scope of the change (and have a similar result), but I think is clearer to the reader.
