DESCRIPTION:

MB-33077 [SR]: Skip Pending SyncWrites at Full Ejection

This is the first of a chain of pacthes for handling correctly Value
Ejection for Durability.

The first point is that a Pending SW is never fully-ejected, as keeping
the Key and Metadata into the HashTable is necessary for enforcing the
Durability semantic about mutation-acceptance.
