DESCRIPTION:

MB-41942: Change PCS/PPS GSL asserts to exceptions

Change PCS and PPS GSL assertions in EPBucket::flushVBucket to
normal exceptions so that we can log some extra information
about the issue (the checkpoint type that we are currently
processing). This will help us narrow down the code paths that
may be taken in this function when we are attempting to update
the value.
