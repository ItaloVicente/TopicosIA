DESCRIPTION:

MB-48094: Add KVStoreIface::initBySeqnoScanContextForLegacyStream()

Add KVStoreIface::initBySeqnoScanContextForLegacyStream() so that
DCPBackfillBySeqnoDisk::markLegacyDiskSnapshot() can request a
KVStore to create a BySeqnoScanContext struct that re-uses a
KVFileHandle. What was originally created for the current backfill.
The reason this needs to be done by a KVStore is that, the MagmaKVStore
implements a child of the BySeqnoScanContext (MagmaScanContext).

The implementation of
MagmaKVStore::initBySeqnoScanContextForLegacyStream() will be modified
in a follow up patch so that it doesn't request its own magma snapshot
and instead uses the snapshot stored inside the MagmaKVFileHandle.
