DESCRIPTION:

MB-48094: Add KVStoreIface::initBySeqnoScanContextForLegacyStream()

Add KVStoreIface::initBySeqnoScanContextForLegacyStream() so that
DCPBackfillBySeqnoDisk::markLegacyDiskSnapshot() can request a
KVStore to create a BySeqnoScanContext struct that re-uses a
KVFileHandle. What was originally created for the current backfill.
The reason this needs to be done by a KVStore is that, the MagmaKVStore
implements a child of the BySeqnoScanContext (MagmaScanContext).

The implementation of
MagmaKVStore::initBySeqnoScanContextForLegacyStream() will be modified
in a follow up patch so that it doesn't request its own magma snapshot
and instead uses the snapshot stored inside the MagmaKVFileHandle.

-1 for the expects. The rest is some kind of brain dump I guess.

I'm a litte torn on this. On the one hand it seems like it would be simpler to add a std::optional<KVFileHandle&> to initBySeqnoScanContext instead. I suppose with the other change to move the snapshot ptr to KVFileHandle we don't dupe as much code and it keeps initBySeqnoScanContext (slightly) simpler.

My only argument against doing things in this way would be that this function is very specific (a bit of a subset of initBySeqnoScanContexts functionality) and it doesn't feel like this needs to be or should be in the KVStore API. 

"Cloning" or copying the scan context feels more like what we want to do here but the unique_ptr to the KVFileHandle is a bit of an obstacle there. Were the KVStoreAPI to have a "makeSharedFileHandle" returning a shared_ptr rather than unique_ptr that the ScanCtx could trivially copy then that feels a bit nicer to me. Thoughts?
Line:1558, engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> probably reasonable to Expects this instead

So I did think of something like you're first option with using a a std::optional, but unfortunately we would need to use a ptr as std::optional's don't support refs. Given this I thought it would just end up confusing the interface. Given it's never needed in the standard case. Also might have confused the logic within each initBySeqnoScanContext(). 

So the reason I went down this route is that we're not really cloning the Context, it's only the handle and startSeqno that we reuse. Hence, I wanted to make it clear that this isn't just a straight up clone and in-fact we're really creating a new scan ctx object that has it's own properties e.g. the FindMaxCommittedItem object.

Ahh yeah, I had forgotten about the different callback we use
