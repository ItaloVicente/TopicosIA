DESCRIPTION:

MB-28502: Add delete_time awareness to flow control acking

DcpProducer tracks how many bytes it sends and the DcpConsumer must
ack how much it receives. With the 'delete-time' feature the delete
packet is larger and as such we must account for this extra data on
DCP streams that are configured with delete-time.
