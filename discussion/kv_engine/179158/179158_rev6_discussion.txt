DESCRIPTION:

MB-53428: Disable and handle any attempt renegotiation SSL

1) Disable OpenSSL renegotiation

This is done by adding SSL_OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION to SSL_CTX_set_options.

2) Ensure KV responds to a renegotiation attempt by checking if
SSL_read has generated a response.

With renegotiation disabled, a client can still attempt to renegotiate.
When this happens an SSL alert is generated by the server and must be
sent back to the client. This is achieved by querying the network BIO
after calling SSL_read if the WANT_READ error occurs. When write data
has been generated call the data is written back to the client and
the read retried.

2.1) Read and process SSL input until connection ends

As part of testing the renegotiation an inconsistency between
mad-hatter and cheshire-cat was noted whilst using the
'openssl s_client' for testing.

The flow of messages was observed in wireshark as follows.

client -> server: Handshake
server -> client: SSL alert, no_renegotiation
client -> server: SSL alert, no_renegotiation

I.e. the client appears to echo back the SSL alert, the openssl client
would also terminate immediately after sending the last message. KV had
a racey behaviour in that sometimes KV engine would process the incoming
alert (and reset the connection) and sometimes it would not see the
message, compared to cheshire-cat where KV would always process the
incoming alert.

This is addressed by moving the check of ssl.hasError to be always after
the sslRead function. When hasError was before the sslRead call, sometimes
we would skip processing the final bytes received from the client.

Line:920, daemon/connection.cc -> Are we still potentially setting reset sooner than we would in the non-SSL case?

For example, if recv() at line 923 returns at least 1 byte of data (even if the socket would return EOF on next read), then we return a successful status and the caller could process that data.

For TLS, given we can make multiple calls to recv() inside sslRead() - via SslContext::drainBioRecvPipe() - we _could_ read useful data from the network (and push it into the SSL BIO), but ssl.hasError() could also be set - so then in this code here we reset the connection and return -1 without processing that received data.

Line:920, daemon/connection.cc -> I wonder if this is testable with testapp, something like do a small mutation+disconnect over SSL and see if the mutation is applied?

I would expect 7.0 it is applied, but mad-hatter may not because we bailed on hasError

Probably, might also need small send() packets and I'm not sure if we have infra for that at the moment.

Nod. It's probably not the end of the world (if we don't process a mutation before close there's no way the consumer necessary knows that is the case - and SyncWrites are fine) - but it might give us more consistent behaviour.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:920, daemon/connection.cc -> New commit adds a unit test which writes a mutation and closes the connection and then connects and reads (1 worker thread configured).

Without some extra changes the sslRead function had read and decrypted the mutation but hit the SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN case and returned 0, the mutation was never applied and a get failed.

Now the test triggers this path and the SSL_ERROR_ZERO_RETURN case returns the ret value, which includes the mutation. The test now passes
