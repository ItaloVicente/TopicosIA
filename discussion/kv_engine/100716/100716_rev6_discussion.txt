DESCRIPTION:

MB-31664: Add ability to disable use of disk backfill queue

Before removing the disk backfill queue, we want to disable its use.
This allows use to extensively test and if an issue is found we can
easily revert to the previous approach of using the backfill queue.

This patch provides the ability to disable the use of the queue with a
non-dynamic configuration setting.  A future patch will switch the
setting so the disk backfill queue is not used.

Once we are happy that there are no adverse effects with not using the
disk backfill queue it, together with the configuration switch, will be
removed.
