DESCRIPTION:

MB-31664: Add ability to disable use of disk backfill queue

Before removing the disk backfill queue, we want to disable its use.
This allows use to extensively test and if an issue is found we can
easily revert to the previous approach of using the backfill queue.

This patch provides the ability to disable the use of the queue with a
non-dynamic configuration setting.  A future patch will switch the
setting so the disk backfill queue is not used.

Once we are happy that there are no adverse effects with not using the
disk backfill queue it, together with the configuration switch, will be
removed.

Couple of points:
1) why don't we just remove the backfill-queue ?
2) we probably need a unit test for this

Hi Paolo, the removal of the backfill queue is actually quite involved and touches multiple files - therefore if we find that we want to revert the change it would be pretty messy.  So with the switch we can test not having the backfill queue and if an issue is found we can easily revert.  The plan is that by the time Mad-Hatter is released the backfill queue (and configuration parameter) will be removed.

I'll write a test that shows that we don't use the backfill queue if the configuration setting is false.

Line:693, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> I think (but not sure) that this is correct. But worth to add a comment.

At first look I would say that in this else-block we have to behave as we do below. But, here we call CM::createSnapshot() unconditionally because we don't want to enqueue into CheckpointId=0, as there is other code around relying on that.

Is that the reason behind your approach?

Line:693, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> I try to explain myself better here.

Currently we signal a PassiveStream in Backfill state by setting OpenCheckpointId=0. E.g., DcpProducer::streamRequest will return ENGINE_TMPFAIL if OpenCheckpointId == 0.

Here we are going to set OpenCheckpointId=1 (updated in createSnapshot()). So in the example above we will allow the creation of outbound streams at Backfill.

It sounds ok (given that we are enqueueing the Backfill snapshot into the CheckpoointManager).
But, I'm not sure if we have any other component relying on "OpenCheckpointId == 0 at Backfill"
