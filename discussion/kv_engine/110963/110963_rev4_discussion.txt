DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add rollback support for magma API

The magma API meets the KV-Engine Storage Requirement by supporting the
ability to create a snapshot at least once per minute and maintain at
least 3 snapshots. This is handled with the configuration parameters
magma_max_commit_points (default 5) and magma_commit_point_interval
(default 2min). But for testing, we need more frequent commit points
similar to what couchstore does by allowing every commit batch to become
a rollback point. So we've introduced a config parameter
magma_commit_point_every_batch in order to facilitate testing.
