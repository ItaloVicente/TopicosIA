DESCRIPTION:

MB-32484: Send ABRT to memcached_testapp on timeout

To attempt to identify the cause of the intermittent timeouts in
memcached_testapp, use the `timeout` program to signal
memcached_testapp with SIGABRT when we timeout; to allow a core dump
to be generated of where the process is stuck.

Using a timeout (240s) before the CTest timeout of 300s below so
`timeout`'s timeout fires first.
