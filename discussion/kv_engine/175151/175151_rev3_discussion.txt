DESCRIPTION:

MB-51916: Add support for refuse data ingress from clients

Add support for the data plane to tell a bucket that it should
not accept data ingress from a client into a bucket. Once
enabled a client may only retrieve (and delete) documents.

Note that this does _NOT_ affect DCP as we don't want to
end up in a situation where we can't store the requested
amount of replicas.
