DESCRIPTION:

MB-25398: Allow store_deleted_with_CAS on non-resident items

When attempting to perform a store operation with a deleted body to a
deleted key, with CAS (!), allow it to succeed if the key is no longer
resident. This is the case if the flusher has completed storing the
delete to disk; and hence the persistence callback has run and removed
the deleted item from the HashTable.

Note this manifested as only an occasional failure when trying to perform:

    1. CAS = delete(key)
    2. subdoc_multi_mutate(key, AccessDeleted=True, new_body=...,
                           in_CAS=cas)

If 1 and 2 executed back-to-back without the flusher running in
between, then the request succeeded, as the deleted item from (1)
would still be resident in the HashTable when we execute (2). However,
if the flusher ran between those two statements, then (2) would fail
with ENOENT.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: long line. Might want to wrap

Line:767, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.cc -> Minor: might want to validate the value to check if the whole value is retrieved as part of the bg fetch

Line:2024, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Returning MutationStatus::NeedBgFetch will result in an exception in Ephemeral buckets.
Shouldn't this be handled differently in Ephemeral buckets ?

Line:1214, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Now this implies that the current bloomfilter needs to be upgraded ?
That is, there is a need to predict yes for deleted (but unpurged) keys, predict no for keys that were never seen ?
A task for master branch (for 5.x or 6) ?

Line:1214, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> I don't think so - deleted documents are virtually always on disk (they are  only present in the HashTable for a short period of time); s

If we included them in the bloomfilter (for full eviction) then we'd pollute the bloomfilter quite a bit and reduce it's hit rate. Additionally we would probably need a second bloomfilter for this; given we want to able to distinguish between deleted and active item on disk normally (most operations only care if an active item is on disk).

I think it's simpler to just keep things as they are - asking for a deleted item should be pretty rare, and moreover they will virtually always be on disk.
