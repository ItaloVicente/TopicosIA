DESCRIPTION:

MB-28327: Support frequency counter over DCP

Provide a new DCP control message for stating whether the consumer
supports the new high fidelity most recently used eviction algorithm
(hifi_mfu) (also known as the statistical counter eviction policy).

If the consumer (and producer) supports the hifi_mfu then for all
mutations pass their associated frequency counter over DCP.  If the
producer uses the hifi_mfu, but the consumer is using the old 2-bit_lru
then we convert each frequency counter value into one of the 4 states
used by the 2-bit_lru algorithm.

Line:599, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Any particular reason why these constants were chosen? Might be worth documenting why if there's some background.

Line:603, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Not sure `evictValue` is the best name here - it sounds like it might have something to do with directly evicting the item. What about something like hotness / popularity etc?

Line:2269, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> There's a common function to handle this kind of thing - look at wait_for_stat_to_be().

Line:591, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> This looks like it could be nicer as a separate function (maybe owned by the frequency counter code)

Line:591, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Done

Line:599, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> I have added a comment providing some background on why we don't want a linear split.

Line:603, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> changed to hotness.

Line:2269, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> There was not a function I needed - so created a similar one called
wait_for_state_to_not_change
