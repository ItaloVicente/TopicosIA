DESCRIPTION:

MB-28327: Support frequency counter over DCP

Provide a new DCP control message for stating whether the consumer
supports the new high fidelity most recently used eviction algorithm
(hifi_mfu) (also known as the statistical counter eviction policy).

If the consumer (and producer) supports the hifi_mfu then for all
mutations pass their associated frequency counter over DCP.  If the
producer uses the hifi_mfu, but the consumer is using the old 2-bit_lru
then we convert each frequency counter value into one of the 4 states
used by the 2-bit_lru algorithm.
