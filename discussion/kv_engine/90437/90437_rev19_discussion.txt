DESCRIPTION:

MB-28327: Support frequency counter over DCP

Provide a new DCP control message for stating whether the consumer
supports the new high fidelity most recently used eviction algorithm
(hifi_mfu) (also known as the statistical counter eviction policy).

If the consumer (and producer) supports the hifi_mfu then for all
mutations pass their associated frequency counter over DCP.  If the
producer uses the hifi_mfu, but the consumer is using the old 2-bit_lru
then we convert each frequency counter value into one of the 4 states
used by the 2-bit_lru algorithm.

There seem to be a lot of whitespace only changes in `ep_testsuite_dcp.cc`, can you revert these?

Patch Set 19:

Hi Tim - Its a result of running git-clang-format  I don't believe there is specifically any white space only changes.  As I modified the testsuite_testcases array (by adding a new test).  The git-clang-format, formats all the array definition correctly.  I think it probably worth fixing the formatting now.

Agree with Tim - it's creating a lot of noise in the patch. Please revert the hunk which reformat the array.

If you want to reformat that to match the clang-format style; please do as a follow-up patch which /just/ changes the whitespace.
