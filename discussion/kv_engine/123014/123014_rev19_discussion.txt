DESCRIPTION:

MB-37416: Add scope aggregated stats

Introduce stats aggregated over all collections in a scope. This only
includes numeric stats which can be meaningfully summed across
collections. Collection can be specified by name or ID (hex, with
optional 0x prefix).

$ cbstats localhost:12000 scopes testscope
 testscope:id:                       0x8
 testscope:items:                    3
 testscope:mem_used:                 56969
 testscope:testcollection2:id:       0x9
 testscope:testcollection2:items:    1
 testscope:testcollection2:mem_used: 52153
 testscope:testcollection3:id:       0xa
 testscope:testcollection3:items:    0
 testscope:testcollection3:mem_used: 0
 ...

$ cbstats localhost:12000 scopes id 0x8
Or
$ cbstats localhost:12000 scopes id 0X8
Or
$ cbstats localhost:12000 scopes id 8
 testscope:id:                       0x8
 testscope:items:                    3
 testscope:mem_used:                 56969
 testscope:testcollection2:id:       0x9
 testscope:testcollection2:items:    1
 testscope:testcollection2:mem_used: 52153
 testscope:testcollection3:id:       0xa
 testscope:testcollection3:items:    0
