DESCRIPTION:

MB-37416: Add scope aggregated stats

Introduce stats aggregated over all collections in a scope. This only
includes numeric stats which can be meaningfully summed across
collections.

$ ~/cbstats -u ... -p ... localhost:12000 collections
 collection:0x0:items:          0
 collection:0x0:mem_used:       0
 collection:0x8:items:          1
 collection:0x8:mem_used:       90
 collection:0x9:items:          1
 collection:0x9:mem_used:       52153
 collection:0xa:items:          0
 collection:0xa:mem_used:       0
 collection:0xb:items:          1
 collection:0xb:mem_used:       4726
 collection:0xc:items:          0
 collection:0xc:mem_used:       0
 collection:0xd:items:          0
 collection:0xd:mem_used:       0
 manifest:collection:0x0:name:  _default
 manifest:collection:0x0:scope: 0x0
 manifest:collection:0x8:name:  testcollection1
 manifest:collection:0x8:scope: 0x8
 manifest:collection:0x9:name:  testcollection2
 manifest:collection:0x9:scope: 0x8
 manifest:collection:0xa:name:  testcollection3
 manifest:collection:0xa:scope: 0x8
 manifest:collection:0xb:name:  testcollection4
 manifest:collection:0xb:scope: 0x8
 manifest:collection:0xc:name:  testcollection5
 manifest:collection:0xc:scope: 0x8
 manifest:collection:0xd:name:  testcollection6
 manifest:collection:0xd:scope: 0x8
 manifest:collections:          7
 manifest:default_exists:       true
 manifest:uid:                  7

$ cbstats -u ... -p ... localhost:12000 collections 0x9
 collection:0x9:items:    1
 collection:0x9:mem_used: 52153

Line:44, /COMMIT_MSG -> The nomclamature / layout isn't very obvious to me here - what's the "manifest:" prefix about before "collection"? Also a numeric scope isn't very helpful - we should at least also have a scope_name: field IMHO.

Line:48, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ditto here - while numeric collections / scopes might be what we use internally; we probably want the user to be able to specify a name also when looking up stats.

Line:44, /COMMIT_MSG -> Indeed - I guess they could either all have the prefix or not have it. The existing code before this change had the same distinction, items did not have the prefix, and scope, name did. I guess it originated from the manifest adding one set of stats, and items being added later in code outside manifest.

Happy to adjust the prefixes as desired if they are not relied upon to be as they are.

Will add scope name.

Line:48, /COMMIT_MSG -> Can add the collection name as a stat here too - but CC: Jim regarding allowing specifying name. As I understood from Jim it's consistent with other APIs to only allow the ID rather than the name, but I could add name->ID conversion done in cbstats for user convenience if desired?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> ... I don't even give an example of the scope aggregated stats :facepalm:

Line:44, /COMMIT_MSG -> Actually, if the name is the focus could flip it entirely to

 collection:testcollection1:id: 0x8
 collection:testcollection1:scope: testscope
 collection:testcollection1:scope_id: 0x8

What's your preference Dave/Jim?
