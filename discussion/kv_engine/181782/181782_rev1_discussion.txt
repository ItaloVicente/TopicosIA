DESCRIPTION:

[BP] MB-53586: Fix error path for get_scope_id

cherry-picks: 2592bd6f2

For unknown collection get_scope_id was returning an incorrectly
initialised EngineErrorGetScopeIDResult meaning the manifest-UID
used for lookup was not included (default of 0 was returned to
client). This commit could be back-ported if required.

Note that the changes to cb::EngineErrorGetScopeIDResult are
to be cleaned up in a subsequent change where get_scope_id(cid) is
replaced by a broader get_collection_meta function.

The updated test_app case highlighted that the usage of get_scope_id
occurred before the incoming key data had been validated by
is_document_key_valid, this is now addressed by incorporating
is_document_key_valid into verify_header
