DESCRIPTION:

MB-49767, MB-44805: Don't send completed prepares for persistent buckets

There are two reasons why we don't want to send completed prepares for
persistent buckets:

1) MB-49767 observed that we might try and re-commit a completed
   prepare for a sync-write delete. This can happen if Magma's implicit
   compaction purges away the commit tombstone of the sync write using
   implicit compaction but not the prepare. This may happen if the
   prepare is not currently in the SSTable, as implicit compaction is
   not performed on the whole vbucket, unlike couchstore's explicit
   compaction. This doesn't cause an issue for the active as the
   prepare is behind the high completed seqno. But if we then perform a
   disk backfill from zero and send this prepare without a completed
   tomstone to a replica which is then promoted to active. The ADM will
   try and re-commit it which will cause a monotonic violation of the
   high completed seqno.

   So by not sending prepares that have already been completed, we
   would never send this prepare and thus, never try to re-commit it.

2) MB-44805, by not sending completed prepares we will save a little on
   the amount of data that needs to be sent to a sync-rep DCP client.
   Also this brings us inline with the behaviour of ephemeral buckets.

This patch also makes a few changes to unit tests to ensure that
ephemeral and persistent buckets behave in the same manner, of not
sending completed prepares when backfilling.
