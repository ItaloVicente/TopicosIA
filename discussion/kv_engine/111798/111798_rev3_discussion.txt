DESCRIPTION:

HashTableBench: Don't replace Committed items with Pending when populating

Tests which add Pending items to the HashTable cannot use
HashTable::set if there's already a Committed item, as the Committed
item will be overwritten. When built in Debug mode this results in the
following assertion failure:

    ../kv_engine/engines/ep/benchmarks/hash_table_bench.cc:137: Failure
    Value of: ht.set(item)
      Actual: 2-byte object <03-00>
    Expected: MutationStatus::WasClean
    Which is: 2-byte object <02-00>

Instead use unlocked_addNewStoredValue().
