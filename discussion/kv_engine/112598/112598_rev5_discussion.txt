DESCRIPTION:

MB-35307: Skip completion of completed SyncWrites

When a replica with PDM is promoted to active mid snapshot we may
have completed prepares pushed into the ADM. Remove these prepares
from trackedWrites on topology change as we cannot re-complete them
(no prepare in the HashTable for an EP Bucket etc).
