DESCRIPTION:

MB-35307: Skip completion of completed SyncWrites

When a replica with PDM is promoted to active mid snapshot we may
have completed prepares pushed into the ADM. Remove these prepares
as the ADM will be unable to commit them (no prepare exists in the
HashTable in an EP Bucket).

Can you expand the tests to check for the trackedWrites being empty after all completed items have been removed?
Line:421, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Nit: You don't really need the if() here - if it's empty then remove_if will just be a no-op...
