DESCRIPTION:

MB-35307: Skip completion of completed SyncWrites

When a replica with PDM is promoted to active mid snapshot we may
have completed prepares pushed into the ADM. Remove these prepares
as the ADM will be unable to commit them (no prepare exists in the
HashTable in an EP Bucket).

Change-Id: I2c2f5001699682a6254648ad98721dc6054c0b92
