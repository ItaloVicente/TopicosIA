DESCRIPTION:

MB-50988: Limit compaction concurrency with LimitedConcurrencyTask

Separate responsibility for limiting CompactTask concurrency from
compaction delay management.

CompactTasks now acquire tokens from a cb::AwaitableSemaphore, or will
snooze() if none are available. Once tokens are available, the task
will be notified to run immediately.

If compaction is requested with a delay, the task will initially sleep
until that time has passed, before attempting to acquire a token and
run.

Even if the task must snooze() until tokens are available, it will not
begin compacting until the desired start time has been reached.

This separation makes it simpler to reason about how many tasks can run
at once.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Code looks good, but the tests from https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/170653 still need integrating into this (hopefully just a simple copy/paste).
