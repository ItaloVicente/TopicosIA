DESCRIPTION:

MB-50988: Limit compaction concurrency with LimitedConcurrencyTask

Identified during MB-49512, if a compaction task for a given vBucket
already is pending and is rescheduled (e.g. due to compaction being
scheduled for collection purge), then the Compaction concurrency limit
is not enforced.

An initial attempt was made to address this
(https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/170082), however this
exposed and magnified existing flaws in how we schedule Compaction
tasks - we can end up sleeping an already scheduled Compaction task
forever (when trying to limit concurrency). This results in compaction
never running for the affected vBuckets, which is particularly
problematic when cleaning up dropped collections - see MB-50941.

To simplify managing compaction tasks, separate concurrency limiting
from delay management.

CompactTasks now acquire tokens from a cb::AwaitableSemaphore, or will
snooze() if none are available. Once tokens are available, the task
will be notified to run immediately.

If compaction is requested with a delay, the task will initially sleep
until that time has passed, before attempting to acquire a token and
run.

Even if the task must snooze() until tokens are available, it will not
begin compacting until the desired start time has been reached.

This separation makes it simpler to reason about how many tasks can run
at once.
