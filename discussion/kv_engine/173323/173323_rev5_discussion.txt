DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Unify "Disk" and "Memory" backfills

Both types of backfill can now share the same state machine. This
is done by moving the state machine code into DCPBackfill and
removing the now duplicate code from each of the sub-classes.

The DCP backfill hierarchy is now much simpler.

DCPBackfillByIdDisk DCPBackfillByIdSeqno DCPBackfillMemoryBuffered

The concrete classes also bring in extra classes for sharing common
data.

DCPBackfillBySeqno is shared by DCPBackfillByIdSeqno and
DCPBackfillMemoryBuffered. This defines the seqno range variables
required for scanning a seqno range.

DCPBackfillDisk is shared by DCPBackfillByIdDisk and
DCPBackfillByIdSeqno. This defines the ScanContext and KVBucket
variables required for a disk scan.
