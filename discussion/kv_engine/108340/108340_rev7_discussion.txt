DESCRIPTION:

MB-33936 [SR]: PDM->ADM transition

A PassiveDM receives in-flight Prepares from the Active and tracks them
until completion (commit/abort).

At vbstate-change Replica->Active, the old PassiveDM must takeover and
start acting as an ActiveDM.

This patch adds supports for converting a PassiveDM to an ActiveDM. The
convertion ensures that the Prepares tracked in the (old) PDM are
retained after the transition has completed.
