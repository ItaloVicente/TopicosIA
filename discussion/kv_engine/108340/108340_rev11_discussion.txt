DESCRIPTION:

MB-33936 [SR]: Convert PDM to ADM at set-vbstate Replica->Active

A PassiveDM receives in-flight Prepares from the Active and tracks them
until completion (commit/abort).

At vbstate-change Replica->Active, the old PassiveDM must takeover and
start acting as an ActiveDM.

This patch adds supports for converting a PassiveDM to an ActiveDM. The
convertion ensures that the Prepares tracked in the (old) PDM are
retained after the transition has completed.
Also, the new Replication Topology must be applied to all the in-flight
Prepares in the new ActiveDM.

Line:36, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Style - simpler to do:

 s->trackedWrites.swap(pdm.state.wlock()->trackedWrites);

Line:1855, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> DurabilityMonitor

Line:1866, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Nit: You can (slightly) simplify to:

 boost::optional<vbucket_state_t> prevVBState = {}

Line:109, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.cc -> Good point.
Very error-prone as it is today. I think we should aggregate all the ack-stuff into a struct/class and provide a class::clear() function.

Line:109, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.cc -> .. but, not doing that as you're removing most of the ack-stuff here in your SecondChain changes  :)
