DESCRIPTION:

MB-37161: Set HCS for Disk Snapshots received from non-MH Producers

When a replica vBucket on a MH node is receiving a disk snapshot from
a pre-MH node, no high completed seqno will be sent. This is expected
(given pre-MH knows nothing of HCS), but the replica should treat this
as a HCS of zero (i.e. it's not possible for anything to have been
committed if we don't yet have SyncWrite support).

As part of this, add an additonal check in
CheckpointManager::createSnapshot() that disk snapshots always have a
HCS set.
