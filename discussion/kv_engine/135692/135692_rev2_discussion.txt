DESCRIPTION:

MB-31869: Don't notify the connection when DCP FlowControl is disabled

As detailed in the MB, DCP shows a relevant throughput degradation if
we disable the DCP FlowControl in memcached.
Root cause of the issue is that we end up calling
Consumer::scheduleNotify() at every incoming DCP Mutation, ~25% of the
total runtime of the mc:worker thread at Consumer as measured by the
profile in my local env.

Note that in the DCP Mutation code-path notifying the connection is
necessary for sending DCP Buffer Ack messages. When FlowControl is
disabled we can just skip the call.

Would also be good to
Line:127, engines/ep/src/dcp/flow-control.cc -> `enabled` is only written in the ctor - as such it's type could be changed to `const bool` and that would avoid the need to acquire `bufferSizeLock` to read it.

Line:127, engines/ep/src/dcp/flow-control.cc -> Just for reference.
As the name suggests, 'bufferSizeLock' is supposed to guard only the FlowControl buffer-size.
FlowControl::enabled is actually already accessed unlocked in FlowControl::handleFlowCtl).
