DESCRIPTION:

MB-46890: Add support for per-bucket audit filter

This patch adds (internal) support for allowing a per-bucket
configuration for audits.

The external API (configuration etc) remains unchanged, but
internally we wrap the old configuration into the new configuration
and initialize the data structures with the new configuration
format.

In the new configuration one may enable events on a per-bucket
level, so one may enable document access audit in bucket A and
disable it in bucket B.

Previously there was a single list of users to ignore audit
events, and that was used to filter _ALL_ different audit events.
In the new model one may specify a list of events where the
user should be ignored. Which means that you could avoid having
document read being audited for user X, but any document write
would be audited for user X.

The same model may be pushed down to scope and collections, but
that is not implemented yet.

Line:48, auditd/src/audit.cc -> Is it specifically important that generation is modified/the filter created while under the wlock?

If so, might be worth noting that; the similar _looking_:

 *event_filter.wlock() = AuditEventFilter::create(++generation, {});

would not do so (since C++17, unsequenced before then IIRC?), might be worth reminding future editors if it does matter.

Line:118, auditd/src/audit.h -> There's also:

 https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/main/folly/SynchronizedPtr.h
 
Which adds some small conveniences e.g., avoids having to double-dereference, has 
wlockPointer() to visibly distinguish "write lock to change the pointer" from 
wlock() "write lock to change the pointed-to object"

Fine as-is if synchronized is more convenient for the usage you need

Line:59, auditd/src/audit_event_filter.cc -> Can you extract the "*" in a named constant and comment what * stands for?

Line:87, auditd/src/audit_event_filter.cc -> The other methods in this class appear to be using the camelCase naming convention. The rest of the changed files in this patchset use snake_case. Given this is new code, maybe follow the existing conventions?

Line:97, auditd/src/audit_event_filter.cc -> Do we need to check if name == "external" here?

Line:100, auditd/src/audit_event_filter.cc -> Suggest adding a doc comment to explain what is being returned and that the result is always sorted.

Line:108, auditd/src/audit_event_filter.cc -> s/ebabled/enabled/

Line:116, auditd/src/audit_event_filter.cc -> s/ebabled/enabled/
Also suggest extending the message: enabled should be an array or "*".

Line:151, auditd/src/audit_event_filter.cc -> Might be a good idea to comment that the array is sorted and consider making const to remove doubt about it's sortedness (or use std::set or something).

Line:48, auditd/src/audit.cc -> The order doesn't really matter, but I find the "withWLock()" style a lot easier to read than the alternative. With the lambda the scope is explicitly provided to the reader, the order of operations are fully clear etc.

Thats more important to me than being able to squeeze more into a single line.

Line:118, auditd/src/audit.h -> Done

Line:59, auditd/src/audit_event_filter.cc -> Done

Line:87, auditd/src/audit_event_filter.cc -> Done

Line:97, auditd/src/audit_event_filter.cc -> Perhaps... The file is provided by ns_server, so it _should_ have the correct syntax...

(Ideally they should fix the file to use "local" instead of "couchbase" as thats what they use in the other cases)

Line:116, auditd/src/audit_event_filter.cc -> Done

Line:151, auditd/src/audit_event_filter.cc -> Done (except for the const as that would implicitly delete the copy constructor of the class. The class is only visible inside this file (except in the case of unity builds where it is also visible with the other files in the same unit, but that's a different issue). All of the public methods of the class are const, so it shouldn't really matter that much...
