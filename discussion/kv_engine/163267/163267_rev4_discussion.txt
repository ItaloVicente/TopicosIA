DESCRIPTION:

MB-48531: Move CursorDrop logic to ClosedUnrefCheckpointRemoverTask

That's for removing the unnecessary CheckpointVisitor boilerplate in a
follow-up.
With this patch, the ClosedUnrefCheckpointRemoverTask attempts in
order ItemExpel first, then CursorDrop only if strictly required by the
current checkpoint memory state.
