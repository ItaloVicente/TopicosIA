DESCRIPTION:

MB-38095: Refactor wrapper code to use WriteDocs API

WriteDocs changes how local documents need to be handled. Instead of
being able to write directly into magma's write cache, we have to use
something similar to pendingReqs where we create a vector of local
document requests to be inserted.

Partial review, didn't get to end. Few comment so far.
Line:574, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> This seems unrelated?

Line:1117, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> This seems a bit odd - there's no (explicit) use of `localDbReqs` I can see in this function, so clearing it here seems the wrong place. Maybe at some higher level function where localDbReqs was actually updated?

Line:1199, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> prefer non-wildcard lambda capture (esp for large lambda functions like this)

Line:1202, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Why the reinterpret_cast here? Given WriteOperaiton is a magma-specific class, can't it use the correct concrete type?

Line:1294, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> prefer constructing the WriteOperation object with an actual constructor. Currently if say a new member variable was added to WriteOperation then this code would still happily compile and potentially not initialise something. If you instead have a ctor (or even an initialiser list) then that isn't the case.

Line:1323, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Does this need to be a member variable? Can it not be handled like WriteOps and just scoped to the function which requires it?

Line:1732, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> As per above comment, you can replace this with writeOps.emplace_back() to (a) be more efficient (create once) and (b) avoid missing any required arguments to the WriteOperation object.

Line:51, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Style: given these are just named generically (WriteOps etc) would be cleaner to move them within say the MagmaKVStore class.

Line:574, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1117, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> localDbReqs was designed to be similar to pendingReqs. Since that solution isn't acceptable, I've made them a local variable. Makes the code a bit uglier.

Line:1199, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1202, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Magma does not want to have any knowledge of what goes inside this pointer. Even adding a forward ptr would remove the flexibility that magma desires incase its working with a client other than kv engine.

Line:1294, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1323, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1732, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:51, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Done
