DESCRIPTION:

MB-38095: Refactor wrapper code to use WriteDocs API

WriteDocs changes how local documents need to be handled. Instead of
being able to write directly into magma's write cache, we have to use
something similar to pendingReqs where we create a vector of local
document requests to be inserted.

Line:118, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> I'm confused.
The MagmaLocalReq is suppose to copy the object into the req to preserve the object. If we don't make a copy of the object, how can the object live past the scope?

Line:118, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> By moving, as per the link. Currently you'll _always_ create a copy of (two) std::strings when performing the construction at line 118, as the arguments are passed by const ref.

If you instead pass by value, then std::move into the class member variables, then if the call-site had an rvalue or similar then you avoid an unnecessary copy.

It's probably not a big deal here given there's probably only 1 local doc per commit batch, but it's generally good style (as per the link).

Line:221, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> At this point, magma::Slices don't take std::string_view. 
We would have to add 3 extra functions so that we could take either string or string view to localReqAdd and localReqDelete.
All the logger calls would need to convert the keys to strings to null terminate them so they print correctly.
This seems to be a case where saving a few bytes of heap allocation that's done once is not worth the added complexity.
What say you?

Line:221, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Well, given a Slice is non-owning sequence of chars, you could just make it a type alias to std::string_view given that's identical. 

You could also make it take std::string_view instead of std::string given std::string is implicitly conferable to std::string_view.

Or you can leave it as-is if you wish, I'm only making recommendations to best / most efficient practice.

Line:221, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> std::string_view is preferred given that doesn't require any heap allocation (and can be created as a constexpr at compile-time).

Line:118, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Perf: You're performing unnecessary copies here - you're essentially forcing the constructor to perform a copy of the input parameter, irrespective of if it is a rvalue (i.e. could just be "consumed" and moved from).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:127, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> I assume the reason for the unique_ptr indirection is because you are pre-calculating the magma::Slice objects as you add items to LocalDbReqs. This adds extra heap allocations (for every MagmaLocalReq instead of allocating within the vector), and is arguably more complicated.

If you simply just accumulate MagmaLocalReqs into a std::vector (which could result in std::string moves as it resizes), but then just build all the Slices at the end (just before you actually commit the batch) then you can simplify and avoid this indirection.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:655, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> This still seems a bit over-complex. Why not just add to LocalDbReqs, then at the point you assemble the Magma commit batch, iterate on localDBReqs and add every element to the commit batch?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:682, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> This doesn't really need to be a member function - given it's just a convenience (to convert a DetachedBuffer to a string before calling localReqAdd it can just be a static function.
