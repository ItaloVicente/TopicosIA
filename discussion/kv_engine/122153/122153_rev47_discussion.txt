DESCRIPTION:

MB-38095: Refactor wrapper code to use WriteDocs API

WriteDocs changes how local documents need to be handled. Instead of
being able to write directly into magma's write cache, we have to use
something similar to pendingReqs where we create a vector of local
document requests to be inserted.
