DESCRIPTION:

MB-38095: Refactor wrapper code to use WriteDocs API

This includes introducing folly::SysArena to hold localDB changes for
the duration of the commit batch. A localDB update (vbstate,
collections, etc) needs to make a copy of the update and hold on to that
copy for the duration of the commit batch.

Line:2148, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> re: your email, I think the problem with this approach is that it's very hard for the reader to tell exactly what is still in / out of scope with an arena, given the livetime of the arena is independent of any objects you have referring to it (e.g. the Slice here). 

If you destroy the arena, then it's easy to end up with dangling pointers.

It's not very clear what the intent of this change is - it seems like maybe you're trying to have a single heterogeneous container for the different updates which can occur (normal doc, local doc, ...?) - but given those _are_ different things it seems simpler and more obvious  to just have a vector for each type (as I think you did previously), push_back() to them as necessary and then when the commit is all done deallocate them (probably by a CommitBatch being deleted.

If I'm missing something, could you expand on the problem you're trying to solve here?

Why use folly::SysArena?
The old API (BatchCommit) would create a local document and immediately write it to magma's write cache so the scope of the object was limited to the routine creating and writing the object. The WriteDocs API takes a vector of WriteOperations which are Magma::Slice's (similar to a sized_buf) and the scope of those objects crosses function boundaries which means I need a way to allocate memory and hold it for the duration of a transaction, in particular a commit or a snapshotVBucket call.
The folly::SysArena was a simple way to create a scoped memory heap that could be used for the duration of a transaction.

I've removed folly::SysArena and replaced it with something similar to pendingReqs but for local documents. The memory for local documents is scoped to the transaction.
