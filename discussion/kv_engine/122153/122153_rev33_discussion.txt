DESCRIPTION:

MB-38095: Refactor wrapper code to use WriteDocs API

WriteDocs changes how local documents need to be handled. Instead of
being able to write directly into magma's write cache, we have to use
something similar to pendingReqs where we create a vector of local
document requests to be inserted.

Line:1178, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> nit: there is space for these on the same line

Line:1282, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> We saw during some testing for 6.5.0 that memory usage whilst flushing was pretty high. Here we are copying some O(n) amount of data to rewrite pendingReqs into writeOps right?

Could you please add a todo here that we investigate whether this is required? If we could keep pendingReqs in a form that writeOps could take that might be better. Should also investigate (at a later date is fine) whether we can add magma variant to our flusher benchmark (which tracks speed and memory usage).

Line:1659, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Coudl we rename this now to reflect what it does? I.e. enqueueVBState or something along those lines

Line:1998, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> do you not get access to the logger via the this capture?

Line:2163, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> is this change necessary?

Line:2316, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Moving the commitPointEveryBatch check to the individual Syncs (as opposed to on creation of the MagmaKVStore) will do two things.

1) Slow down flushes (anything doing a Sync) as the configuration is guarded by a single mutex (for the entire bucket).
2) Make the commitPointEveryBatch configuration value dynamic. If this is desired, then configuration.json needs updating accordingly

Line:128, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Would prefer if this was more verbose. In deleteCollectionStats we have "localDbReqs.emplace_back(MagmaLocalReq(key));". I don't think it's clear enough that creating a MagmaLocalReq with just a key deletes the doc. From the code in deleteCollectionStats I would assume that it's writing an empty document.

Line:1178, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1282, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> I'm not sure I understand the comment here. The WriteOperation is currently 112B but it should probably be refactored to be ~68B. But I don't see how saving a few bytes here and forcing magma to learn about an external type (MagmaIORequest) would have a significant impact on memory savings or copy. And magma would then be dependent on MagmaIORequsts which goes against magma being an independent storage engine. If I were to put a TODO here, what is the change requested and what is the expected outcome?
I add MB-38561 to address adding magma to KV flusher benchmark.

Line:1659, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1998, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:2163, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> This is identical to CouchKVStore::saveCollectionStats().

Line:2316, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:128, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Done

Line:1282, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Thanks for adding the TODO.

Then we could potentially just store a WriteOps vector alongside pendingReqs. Or, if magma implements that API then we can make the changes required then.

Line:1282, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> I miscalculated the size of WriteOperation... it should be 112B. But, that doesn't change my initial comment.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1282, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Storing the WriteOperation in the MagmaIORequest won't help. It won't save any memory because each MagmaIORequest will have the WriteOperation and it won't save any copies because we have to transfer the WriteOperation to the WriteOps vector. We are working on a potential solution where we can save the memory by allowing the WriteOperation to get created at the point of insertion into Magma::WriteCache directly from the pendingReq. But that is aways out.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1282, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> "@TODO Perf: investigate if we can store the WriteOperation in pendingReqs so that we don't have to create one and copy stuff here".

I did a bunch of work for MB-36926 to reduce memory overhead of flushing with couchstore. We were wasting ~35% of the memory we allocated and a bunch of time in allocations https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-36926?focusedCommentId=380535&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-380535. We were wasting a bunch of memory (and time) storing copied duplicates of some fields (such as VBid and keys). If we could just create a WriteOperation and store that in pendingReqs we'd save memory and time. The extra size of a WriteOperation /does/ matter when you have n of them.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:128, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> deleted should default to false. It can still be very unclear that we are deleting a local doc if we just create a MagmaLocalReq with just a key.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:128, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> I can change it but what your saying is that we have engineers who don't look at ctor's and don't look at comments. That being the case, I'll remove the default so that one must explicitly set it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:128, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> It's not about reading each constructor and the comments, it's about the principle of least surprise https://wiki.c2.com/?PrincipleOfLeastAstonishment. I'd argue that when reading the code you shouldn't even have to look at the constructor, but the call should be simple and clear that it makes a deleted local doc.
