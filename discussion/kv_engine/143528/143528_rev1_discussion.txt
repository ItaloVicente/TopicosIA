DESCRIPTION:

MB-43680: Record JSON validation runtimes

Time the duration of JSON validation done as part of executing client
requests, recoring the timings to:

* A new trace span.
* A new per-bucket histogram.

The trace span will be reported as part of Slow operation logging -
for example:

    WARNING 57: Slow operation. {...,"trace":"... json_validate=6446937532739980:18555 ...

The histograms will be reported via mctimings using the stat key
'json_validate', this will be added to cbcollect_info via a future
ns_server patch.

(but I guess both this and the previous patch should be multiple histograms (also include the size in some way) as the size would have a significant impact on the runtime unless most items have the same size).

Size certainly will have an impact. We do already have some measure of the size of requests (see item_alloc_size histogram) which can be used in conjunction with these two histograms.

I think the challenge is picking a "sensible" number of histograms - for example we could add a second variant of each of these histograms which are per-byte (json_validate_per_byte) - but that's arguably of limited value (other than benchmarking their system's CPU), as we probably know the expected performance per-byte. My intent here was to capture the fact that JSON parsing / Snappy decompress is a significant contributor to the request performance, so simply measuring the overall runtime of each function I think is helpful there.

(Probably what we'd ideally want is some kind of OpenTelemetry integration...)
