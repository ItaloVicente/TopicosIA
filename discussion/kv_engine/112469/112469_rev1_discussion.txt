DESCRIPTION:

MB-35245: Send items from Disk checkpoint as Disk snapshot

If a replica receives a Disk snapshot from an active then is
promoted it may then stream de-duped items from the
CheckpointManager. This is problematic as these items are sent by
ActiveStream as a Memory snapshot. This causes the replica to make
all sanity checks possible for durable writes that cannot be
satisfied if the original source of the items is disk. All of these
items are written into Disk checkpoints on the new active so we can
instead send Disk checkpoints as Disk snapshots to the replica which
can then make the appropriate sanity checks.

Currently, ActiveStream will attempt to fetch all items possible from
the CheckpointManager. Instead of doing this, modify CheckpointManager
to only return items from contiguous Checkpoints of the same type. In
the general case this will be functionally no different, but if a
newly promoted active has a Disk checkpoint then it will only fetch
items from Disk checkpoints. The next run of the
ActiveCheckpointProcessorTask will move the cursor into a Memory
checkpoint and fetch all items from Memory checkpoints. Also, when
receiving a new item as an active node, if the current checkpoint is
Disk then the new active should put this item in a new Memory
checkpoint to ensure that all sanity checks are made. One thing to note
is that the set_vbucket_state operation to turn the replica to an
active will be in the Disk checkpoint.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> I think it's worth splitting this patch into two :-

a) Only fetch items from the same Checkpoint type in each call to getAllItemsForCursor() - and maybe rename that to getNextItemsForCursor or similar?

b) Actually use the new checkpoint type flag
Line:694, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Is this necessary? Seems to complicate an already-complex condition.

Line:852, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I don't think we need to complicate this by checking the cursor type. I think it's fine to just split persisted items also on different checkpoint types (and indeed we might have some odd consistency issues if we _do_ merge them).

Line:1017, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I don't understand why this is necessary. As and when the replica receives the next  snapshot_marker flagged as CHK we'll create a new Checkpoint then.

Line:694, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> In which case I think it's better to make the check more specific - i.e. when changing state from replica to active, explicitly create a new memory snapshot. Maybe re-purpose / rename resetSnapshotRange() to do this.

back to 1 patch re slack comments
Line:694, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Done. createNewCheckpoint sets snap start and snap end for us in the same way that resetSnapshotRange did but on the next checkpoint

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:694, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> It's not strictly necessary, but I believe if we transition from replica to active then we do not create a new checkpoint (may be my test skipping the pending state though).  If the replica has only received a disk snapshot then I believe it will stay in a disk checkpoint until it HAS to create a new checkpoint. Don't want to skip sanity checks  if we then do a new sync write as we should be able to make them.

Line:1017, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> See first comment in this file, the first condition is simply to ensure it makes it into this function. We only execute this code on the active
