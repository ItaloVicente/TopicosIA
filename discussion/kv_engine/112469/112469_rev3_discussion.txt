DESCRIPTION:

MB-35245: getAllItems returns only items for a given ckpt type

Currently, ActiveStream will attempt to fetch all items possible from
the CheckpointManager. Instead of doing this, modify CheckpointManager
to only return items from contiguous Checkpoints of the same type. In
the general case this will be functionally no different, but if a
newly promoted active has a Disk checkpoint then it will only fetch
items from Disk checkpoints. The next run of the
ActiveCheckpointProcessorTask will move the cursor into a Memory
checkpoint and fetch all items from Memory checkpoints.

We need this functionality to allow ActiveStream to send Disk
checkpoint items as a Disk snapshot in a future change.
