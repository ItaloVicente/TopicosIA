DESCRIPTION:

MB-39505: Rework default labels in StatCollector

Previously, adding a default label modified the existing StatCollector,
and returned a handle which would remove the default label when it went
out of scope.

This might not be the expected behaviour as it does not follow common
patterns; with a "mutable" set of labels hidden in a collector, it is
not clear what a call to addStat will do.

Now, the new collector returned from `withLabels` can be used to add a
labelled stat, and the existing collector is not altered.

 StatCollector collector;
 auto labelledCollector =
     collector.withLabels({{"scope","scopeName"}});

 // add a stat without the scope label
 collector.addStat(...)

 // add a stat _with_ the scope label
 labelledCollector.addStat(...)

Nothing blocking, if you prefer the small issues can be fixed in a follow-up patch.
Line:118, include/statistics/collector.h -> "can be set as a default" - this is slightly misleading, maybe rephrase?

Line:58, statistics/collector.cc -> Nit: This is a somewhat over-complex way of specifying an argument is (always) unused - simply don't give it a name:


 void CBStatCollector::addStat(std::string_view k,
                               std::string_view v,
                               const Labels&)
