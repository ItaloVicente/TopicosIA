DESCRIPTION:

MB-28738: UBSan: nullptr use in GlobalTask

As reported by UBSan (in test code):

    globaltask.cc:53:23: runtime error: member call on null pointer of type 'EventuallyPersistentEngine'
        #0 0x1007a0809 in GlobalTask::GlobalTask(EventuallyPersistentEngine*, TaskId, double, bool) globaltask.cc:53

The issue is that test code uses the GlobalTask constructor taking an
EventuallyPersistentEngine*; which it doesn't have an instance of (and
hence passed nulltpr). Address this by moving to the constructor
taking a Taskable&, which we have a mock instance of.
