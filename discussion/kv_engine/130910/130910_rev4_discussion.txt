DESCRIPTION:

[1/N] Use chrono-based UptimeClock instead of rel_time_t

Add a new std::chrono based class - UptimeClock. This is a clock which
counts the number of seconds since the memcached process started up.

This is functionally equivilant to the rel_time_t type, however it
much safer. rel_time_t is error-prone, given it is just a typedef to
uint32_t and hence was compatible with time_t and similar types. As
such it was possble to assign/compare a rel_time_t to time_t and no
error would be flagged.

Convert the bulk of the uses of rel_time_t to UptimeClock and related
chrono types (e.g. std::chrono::seconds).
