DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: Add Collection's history setting to VB::Manifest

Make the collection's history configuration (which only affects
deduplication) available via the VB::Manifest - this will later
be used to configure deduplication for writes to the vbucket.

Limitation of this patch:

There is no replication of the VB::Manifest value, only an active
vbucket will know the value and state change will not adjust the
value. These limitations will be addressed separately.
