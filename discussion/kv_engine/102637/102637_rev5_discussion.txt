DESCRIPTION:

MB-31810: In-memory collection high seqno preparation

Grab collections read handles around any other operations that
require them in kv_bucket. Pass the collections read handles where
required into the notifySeqno functions where they will be used to
update the collection high seqno.

Main issue I'd like to see addressed is the documentation on nofityNewSeqno & the change at line 2620. 


But it would be good (follow-up patch) to improve the naming of the global and per-Collection classes.
Line:2581, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> As an aside, the names "CachingReadHandle" and "ReadHandle" arn't great to the outside reader; I assume that one is a handle on the whole Manifest; the other is a handle on a specific collection within the manifest - but this isn't at all clear from the class name...

Line:2620, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Why the need for this change - shouldn't we be calling notifyNewSeqno? This is creating a 3rd inconsistent way to invoke the callback :(

Line:1549, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Useful to highlight the difference between these two overloads - I assume it's between the case where the specific manifest is already known compared to the case where it needs to be looked up based on the key?

Line:1551, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> ... sentence seems to stop abruptly...

Line:2581, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I agree.

Both handles are read locks on the ENTIRE VB::Manifest.

The ReadHandle gives you functions that are applicable to the entire collection map (exists, doesDefaultExist, getSomeStat by specifying a collection id etc).

The CachingReadHandle gives you functions that only make sense in the context of a single collection (setStat without specifying a collection id, isCollectionValid etc).

Line:2620, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Yeah :( I don't like this one either

This function is called by operations in VB::Manifest that are wrapped in WriteHandles so can't create a caching/readHandle to call the overload. It's also ONLY called by WriteHandle wrapped functions that are queuing SystemEvents and because the implementation of the persistedHighSeqno doesn't track SystemEvents it seemed best to not track them for the in memory high seqno for consistency.

I suppose when we call a WriteHandle function I could pass "this" (the WriteHandle) to the VB::Manifest function and down into queueItem so that I could create another locked (WriteHandle) notifyNewSeqno overload. Just hadn't thought about trying that before

Line:2581, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> There is actually another difference, CachingReadHandles do an initial lookup based on some collection id via a DocKey. Normal ReadHandles do not. So in some places we can be more efficient.

Addressed everything but the naming. Any suggestions for better names? I'm struggling to think of any. See previous comment that (hopefully) explains what the handles actually do
Line:2620, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Done

Line:1549, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> hopefully it's clearer now

Line:1551, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Done
