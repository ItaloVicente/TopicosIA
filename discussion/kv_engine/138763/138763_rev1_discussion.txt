DESCRIPTION:

Unwrap cookie iface after background threads have stopped

A following change ( http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/137978/
) introduced a race between the StatSnap task and
~WrappedServerCookieIface, on reading/writing the cookie interface.

Moving the wrapper to a member variable extends its life until after
TearDown() is called and the engine is destroyed.

Change-Id: I0c971f12a5ed3a07d66c2d19eef5fb0ca6b335bf
