DESCRIPTION:

MB-35631: Only persist HCS after complete disk snapshot persisted

Currently, the HCS sent as part of a disk snapshot marker will be
persisted the first time any items from the checkpoint are flushed to
disk. This lead to non-monotonicity as the flusher would later try to
persist a /lower/ HCS upon encountering a commit.

This patch ensures the disk snapshot HCS will only be persisted if the
current flush batch reaches the end of the disk checkpoint.

Line:1059, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> 3?

Line:1102, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> In reality, this should be a mutation as we are in a Disk snapshot. May be worth adding an abort of some other prepare to this snapshot to show that the abort can advance the HCS (as we do send those in Disk snapshots).
