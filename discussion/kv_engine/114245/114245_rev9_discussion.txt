DESCRIPTION:

MB-35631: Only persist HCS after complete disk snapshot persisted

Currently, the HCS sent as part of a disk snapshot marker will be
persisted the first time any items from the checkpoint are flushed to
disk. This lead to non-monotonicity as the flusher would later try to
persist a /lower/ HCS upon encountering a commit.

This patch ensures the disk snapshot HCS will only be persisted if the
current flush batch reaches the end of the disk checkpoint.
