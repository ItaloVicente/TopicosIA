DESCRIPTION:

MB-53052: Update frequencies for all Buckets when sharing HT quota

We want the frequency counters of items in buckets sharing quota to
relate to one another such that we can make eviction decisions across
buckets.

This change adds a new ItemFreqDecayerTaskManager which orchestrates
the execution of the per-item ItemFreqDecayerTask for all buckets
sharing memory. By running the ItemFreqDecayerTask the same number of
times for buckets sharing HT quota, the resulting frequency counters
will have been decremented the same number of times, which will make
cross-bucket frequency counter comparisons make sense.

Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

(10 comments)
Line:32, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.cc -> How often to we expect to call the create() method? I ask because calling methods on Configuration is expensive as it requires acquiring a single mutex on the Configuration class and walking an unordered_map to lookup the config key being requested.

If it's (potentially) very frequent, I would suggest caching the value of isCrossBucketHtQuotaSharing() in the ItemFreqDecayerTaskManager; and adding a listener to the config to propagate any changes.

Line:89, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.cc -> How do we deal with scheduling skew here - i.e. task->wakeup() is a no-op if the task has already been woken up, but has not yet been executed. As such, for multiple buckets if you try to wake ItemFrequencyDecayer tasks for all, there's no guarantee when each Buckets' task will be executed, and I believe you could end up with unequal number of runs for each bucket (if say one was slow to be executed and then essentially "missed" a wakeup)...?

Line:19, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.h -> We don't appear to use WeakPtrBag in any class definitions etc - only as a return type for one of the methods. That means we should be able to forward-declare this class.

Line:39, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.h -> This doesn't need to be inline - please move to .cc 

(it'll involve generating code which does double-checked locking for "magic statics", so it's more code than it may initially appear to be...)

Line:43, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.h -> If this should only be constructed via the static get() method, suggest the ctor is made private.

Line:58, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.h -> Please document the percentage parameter.

Line:60, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.h -> Style: This is probably the second-most important method of the class (after get()); suggest ordering the class so this appears say after the get() method.

Line:101, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.h -> What's the ownership model of ItemFreqDecayerTask here? If we only have a non-owning pointer; then what happens if the task runs to completion and ExecutorPool attempts to delete it?

Line:2226, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> As previous comment, we probably want to cache this config variable.

Line:14, tests/testapp_cluster/CMakeLists.txt -> Nit: whitespace, and not in alphabetical order.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:32, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.cc -> This is only called once per ep-engine instance, from the engine's constructor.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:89, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.cc -> Because of the notified guard, which we reset only when all tasks are done, I don't believe we can lose a wakeup here. I've added an extra debug-only assertion.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:19, engines/ep/src/item_freq_decayer.h -> Ah, sorry. We're using WeakPtrBag in on line 76, so I cannot remove the header.

The previous patch added a forward decl, but didn't remove the header, and I didn't realise we are using the template until now.

Line:2226, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Done. I don't think we need a change listener as this is not a dynamic config parameter.
