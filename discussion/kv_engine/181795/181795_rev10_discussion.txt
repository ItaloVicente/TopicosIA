DESCRIPTION:

MB-53052: Update frequencies for all Buckets when sharing HT quota

We want the frequency counters of items in buckets sharing quota to
relate to one another such that we can make eviction decisions across
buckets.

This change adds a new ItemFreqDecayerTaskManager which orchestrates
the execution of the per-item ItemFreqDecayerTask for all buckets
sharing memory. By running the ItemFreqDecayerTask the same number of
times for buckets sharing HT quota, the resulting frequency counters
will have been decremented the same number of times, which will make
cross-bucket frequency counter comparisons make sense.
