DESCRIPTION:

MB-32661: [BP] Fix expiration decoding with docflags included

This patch fixes an issue where mutations would ignore and reset
expiry times back to 0 if docflags were included in the extras.
The test also included in this patch tests this, which is added
to an existing similar test to avoid adding more sleep time.
