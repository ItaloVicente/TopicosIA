DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Add deletionSource to Item operators and copy constructor

This patch adds deletionSource to the equivilance operator, the
output operator and the copy constructor inside Item. This involves
adding a to_string method for deletionSource for the output
operator to function.

This fixes MB-32348, an issue seen in xattr output over a DCP
non-xattr stream, as in the process of pruning an item it gets
replicated before it is pruned. The copy contructor originally did
not retain the deletionSource, so the copied item was left
defaulting to 'deleted explicitly', causing the stream to output
a deletion rather than an expiration. By retaining the
deletionSource on replication, this issue is removed.
A test has been added to check that an items values are preserved
over a copy.

Couple of minor comments
Line:189, engines/ep/src/item.cc -> NIt: you could keep this a bit more compact by having deleted print the source if true - e.g. output one of:

 deleted:false
 deleted:true(explicit)
 deleted:true(ttl)

Line:39, utilities/types.cc -> Style: Suggest dropping the "Expired" part and just print "TTL"

(For things like to_string for enums prefer to keep the output as close to the enum value as possible for ease of copying / searching etc).
