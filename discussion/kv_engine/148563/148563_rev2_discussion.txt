DESCRIPTION:

Remove the CM::setOpenCheckpointId API

CheckpointId is a CM internal quantity that shouldn't really be set from
the user.
The current usage of that API is legacy code, probably from TAP.

Patch Set 2:

Purely out of curiosity, but are there still important internal usages of the ID? That is, if the ID were to be removed entirely, would it break anything more than test expectations?

You read my mind :)
There are just a few production usages around, and I believe that those can be removed (eg look at checkpoint-removal). Apart from those all the rest is test-usage.
I'm testing a patch and see how it goes, probably the only side effect worth of note is the we are losing the openCkpt/lastClosedCkpt ID stats, but I doubt anybody is using those.
Question is: Is CheckpointID still useful at diagnostic?
