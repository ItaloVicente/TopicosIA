DESCRIPTION:

MB-23898: skip get() call if KeyOnly is true

Previously we would retrieve the value of a key even if the stream
was key only. Instead, check if this is the case, and skip the retrieval
 if the key is not a SystemEvent (which still requires the value).

Also add unit-testing for this. Unit testing for the edge case of
SystemEvents in NoValue streams is already covered by
SingleThreadedActiveStreamTest's NoValueStreamBackfillsFullSystemEvent.

Line:46, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> Please document the declaration of functions / methods; not the definition - see https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#commenting

Note you should open with a doxygen-style comment `/**` which informs tooling this is a method description. 

(Implementation details can be included if of use, but they should be in the definition (i.e. here), inside the method.

Line:100, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> You're duplicating a bunch of code here with the code at lines 120-121 for example.

Please restructure so you avoid duplicating - say by just making an empty Item and then passing that down to backfillReceived() in a single call.

Line:2519, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Please document

Line:121, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Sleeping in tests is generally to be avoided - it's slow, and is often error-prone.

I think you should be able to test this at a more specific level (without DCP), and without running multi-threaded code. Take a look at backfill_disk_test.cc - I expect you should be able to slot the test in there.

Line:46, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> Will rewrite as a proper doxygen comment with @param etc, this was initially meant as more of an internal explanation

Line:100, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> Did it this way to start off with but I felt it was much less clear, especially since the logic is slightly different between keyOnly and value. And my implementation didn't seem too great as it required at least two std::move's. Will try again.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Missing actual call to test hook inside getInternal() - not caught because test is assert called 0 times. 

Would've been caught if I continued adding SystemEvent or non-KeyOnly version tests. Though these cases are covered independently and so cover the correct behaviour for CacheCallback, they don't cover the behaviour of *this* test, and so a regression where .get() is called for a KeyOnly stream on a non-SystemEvent key is possible. Will fix.
