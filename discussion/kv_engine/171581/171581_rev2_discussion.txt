DESCRIPTION:

MB-23898: skip get() call if KeyOnly is true

Previously we would retrieve the value of a key even if the stream
was key only. Instead, check if this is the case, and skip the retrieval
 if the key is not a SystemEvent (which still requires the value).

Also add unit-testing for this. Unit testing for the edge case of
SystemEvents in NoValue streams is already covered by
SingleThreadedActiveStreamTest's NoValueStreamBackfillsFullSystemEvent.
