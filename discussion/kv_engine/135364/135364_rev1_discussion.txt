DESCRIPTION:

MB-41183: Change representation of connection in audit

The connection details in the audit record should not be a string
named sockname or peername, but in an object looking like:

    "connection": {
      "remote": {
        "ip": "::1",
        "port": 1234
      },
      "local": {
        "ip": "::1",
        "port": 321
      }
    }

As that ease the filtering when you don't have to deal with trying
to determine if it is an IPv4 or IPv6 address and how the ports
are specified (IPv4: 127.0.0.1:1234, IPv6: ::1[1234])
