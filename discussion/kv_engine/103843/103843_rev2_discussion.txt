DESCRIPTION:

MB-32589: AddStatsStream: Correctly account allocated mem to NonBucket (take 2)

The previous fix for this issue (in the alice branch) failed to
correctly account for the memory freed by the std::string created from
'buf':

     auto* e = ObjectRegistry::onSwitchThread(nullptr, true);
>    auto value = buf.str(); // value is of type std::string
     callback(key.data(), key.size(), value.data(), value.size(), cookie);
     ObjectRegistry::onSwitchThread(e);

The manual onTheadSwitch() calls incorrectly assigned the deallocation
of std::string to the engine as the std::string dtor runs after
onThreadSwitch(e).

Fix (hopefully correctly this time!) by using a scoped guard
instead. Also includes a unit test.
