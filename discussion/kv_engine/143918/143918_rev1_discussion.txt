DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Compress system events for ephemeral buckets

For ephemeral vbuckets, compress the system-event Item as it will
be retained in memory. This reduces the memory overhead that results
from the creation of collections in the cases of:

* many collections/scopes
* use of large names
* both

Persistent buckets won't keep the item in the hash-table, it only
remains in memory until flushed.

It does depend on the name length as to the effect (I was testing at the time with maxxed out names, but also very compressable names with many repeating characters), I can get some numbers

The system-event Item value is flatbuffer data.

Here's a quick dump of CreateCollection Item->getNBytes with increasing name (+2) length
from 0 to 18 bytes, and finally with maxxed name (251)

name length | size 
===================
0           | 40   
2           | 40   
4           | 44   
6           | 44   
8           | 48   
10          | 48   
12          | 52   
14          | 52   
16          | 56   
18          | 56   
251         | 288  

Looks like the size is calculated as:
    40 + 4 * (strlen(name)/4)

So the output from this patch really depends on the name content as to the new/compressed size (and compressValue only stores compressed if it made the value smaller).

Note that we also have other system-events

* CreateScope is a bit smaller and is impacted by scope-name length.
* DropScope/DropCollection don't store any variable data.
** For example DropCollection is 24 bytes (and compressValue cannot make it smaller).

Thanks Jim. Suggest including that in the commit message for context / future reference then I'll +2 😊
