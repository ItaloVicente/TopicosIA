DESCRIPTION:

MB-25723: Force reading the next packet for SSL connections

I've seen cases where the SSL tests would hang because we've
successfully completed a command, but the next command was
stuck inside our input buffers. We would then enter the
waiting state, but as the client was done sending the command
we don't get a read notification on the socket.

To work around that problem let's try to fetch the next command
header from the input stream (which would cause those buffers
to be drained) for SSL connections. If the packet isn't
available it'll enter the conn_waiting state.

For plain connections we don't have data spooled up in this
case so we don't need the extra "recv" call.

Can we write a test for this? Maybe some specially-crafted requests of the correct size?

I'm not sure how easy that is (and how often it'll fail on our CV due to issues that might affect this). If the socket buffers are full, things may not be available on the receiving side when trying to consume the input data. (and in theory that could also be affected by "overhead" introduced by OpenSSL.. if that suddenly generates additional bytes it could might as well also cause us to do our buffering differently).

I feel like we should /try/ to create a test; otherwise this is going to be random undefended code...

So far I've not been able to reproduce it in a standalone test yet... (in my hang scenario when I thought I had it hanging was that I was hanging on sending the precomputed stream due to full socket buffers on the transmit side in memcached so it backed off)...
