DESCRIPTION:

MB-25723: Force reading the next packet for SSL connections

I've seen cases where the SSL tests would hang because we've
successfully completed a command, but the next command was
stuck inside our input buffers. We would then enter the
waiting state, but as the client was done sending the command
we don't get a read notification on the socket.

To work around that problem let's try to fetch the next command
header from the input stream (which would cause those buffers
to be drained) for SSL connections. If the packet isn't
available it'll enter the conn_waiting state.

For plain connections we don't have data spooled up in this
case so we don't need the extra "recv" call.

I've spent a few hours trying to create a reliable way to reproduce the problem in a test case but I haven't been able to do so.

I think it's pragmatic to merge as-is then; if we can't figure out a specific test :(
