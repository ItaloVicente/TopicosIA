DESCRIPTION:

Fixed SCRAM-SHA nonce stringification.

Previously, the hex_encode_nonce method would extend
each character to 32-bits to avoid the built-in char
handling in stringstream.  This had the side-effect of
causing the 8-bit number to be signed-extended before
printing, causing numbers great than 0x7F to print as
32-bit numbers rather than the desired 8-bits.
