DESCRIPTION:

MB-31718: Correct doc counts after rollback

We currently do not track collection diskCounts in the event
of a rollback. In particular, as we do not increment the
collection diskCount when we rollback a deletion, we can crash
if we perform deletions until the diskCount would go below 0.

Update EPDiskRollbackCB to both increment and decrement the
collection document diskCount when we rollback sets and deletions
respectively.

Also, correct the vBucket item count as we do not currently deal with
this correctly during a rollback. At the moment we do not increment
it when we rollback a deletion, and we decrement it if it did not
exist before the rollback seqno even if it had been deleted before
the rollback started.
