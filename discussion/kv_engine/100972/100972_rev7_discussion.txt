DESCRIPTION:

MB-31718: Correct collection doc counts after rollback

We currently do not track collection diskCounts in the event
of a rollback. In particular, as we do not increment the
collection diskCount when we rollback a deletion, we can crash
if we perform deletions until the diskCount would go below 0.

Update EPDiskRollbackCB to both increment and decrement the
collection document diskCount when we rollback sets and deletions
respectively.

I've split them up. QE needs the collection counts correcting asap as it's now a test blocker. 

http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/101055/

Currently we are over decrementing the count and never incrementing it (so it may be too low post rollback), which is a potential issue as the vBucket diskCount is also a NonNegativeCounter (throws when decrementing below 0). I'll see if we are eating that exception or throwing to breakpad.

From code inspection looks like we just throw this up to breakpad so the vBucket count could be an issue in 5.1/vulcan/alice
