DESCRIPTION:

MB-41092: Ensure Manifest::saveDroppedCollection() stores HighSeqno

Currently saveDroppedCollection() stores the persisted on disk high
seqno for the dropped collection. This can cause an issue where we don't
trigger compaction after the drop collection Causing on disk item count
to look wrong which the user will see in full eviction. This is due to
Flush::countNonEmptyDroppedCollections() which decides if there are any
non empty collections that have been dropped in a flush. This function
then performs the check highSeqno != 0 && highSeqno !=
dropped.startSeqno. Which will be false if the persisted seqno is 0.
This can happen when the collection drop system event is added to the
dirty queue before any mutations have been persisted to disk.

To fix this we change Manifest::saveDroppedCollection() to store the
collections high seqno over the persisted high seqno in the
Manifest::droppedCollections map.
