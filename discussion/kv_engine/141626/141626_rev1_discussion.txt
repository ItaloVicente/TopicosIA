DESCRIPTION:

MB-41092: Ensure Manifest::saveDroppedCollection() stores HighSeqno

Currently saveDroppedCollection() stores the persisted on disk high
seqno for the dropped collection. This can cause an issue where we don't
trigger compaction after the drop collection Causing on disk item cound
to look wrong which the user will see in full eviction. This is due to
Flush::countNonEmptyDroppedCollections() which decides if their are any
non empty collections that have been dropped in a flush. This function
then performs the check highSeqno != 0 && highSeqno !=
dropped.startSeqno. Which will be false if the persisted seqno is 0.
This can happen when the collection drop system event is added to the
dirty queue before any mutations have been persisted to disk.

To fix this we change Manifest::saveDroppedCollection() to store the
collections high seqno over the persisted high seqno in the
Manifest::droppedCollections map.

Fix is good! :sadpanda: I only added this recently, couple of tweaks and maybe a more directed test would be good!
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> count

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> nit: there

Line:1189, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_eraser_test.cc -> Interesting to see this test changes result based on the fix.

Also wonder if it's possible to update or clone something simple like "CollectionsEraserTest, basic" to do this?

The bug seems simple to setup (hard to hit in a live system), just create collection (flush). second batch is mutate and drop? The high-persisted seqno is 0 at that point (for the drop).

Could you verify if this now satisfies MB-43081 (i.e we schedule compactions for collections that only contain prepares). If so, would be good to add to the commit message. 

If that is the case then also need to update comment in flush.cc (clause 2 of the comment in Flush::countNonEmptyDroppedCollections) as that is now incorrect.
Line:1189, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_eraser_test.cc -> Definitely interesting. Having looked at this recently I suppose it's a side effect of flush.cc ignoring all prepares in the persisted seqno.

I think that this "fixes" MB-43081 too and we'll end up scheduling compactions for collections with only prepares in them. May also be worth rebasing on top of http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/141445 so that anything assuming runCompaction schedules a compaction is validly testing things.

Line:1227, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_eraser_test.cc -> Needs updating

Line:1189, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_eraser_test.cc -> Will investigate @Ben and add some extra tests :) wanted to get some eyes on the fix first to make sure I didn't miss anything. Also I've verified the test will a system test to definility the issue we where seeing with TAF
