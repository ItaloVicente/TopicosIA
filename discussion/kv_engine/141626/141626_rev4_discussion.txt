DESCRIPTION:

MB-41092: Ensure Manifest::saveDroppedCollection() stores HighSeqno

Currently saveDroppedCollection() stores the persisted on disk high
seqno for the dropped collection. This can cause an issue where we don't
trigger compaction after the drop collection Causing on disk item count
to look wrong which the user will see in full eviction. This is due to
Flush::countNonEmptyDroppedCollections() which decides if there are any
non empty collections that have been dropped in a flush. This function
then performs the check highSeqno != 0 && highSeqno !=
dropped.startSeqno. Which will be false if the persisted seqno is 0.
This can happen when the collection drop system event is added to the
dirty queue before any mutations have been persisted to disk.

To fix this we change Manifest::saveDroppedCollection() to store the
collections high seqno over the persisted high seqno in the
Manifest::droppedCollections map.

Could you add MB-43081 to the commit message too so that we can track that this should fix that MB please.

Forgot about a comment in Flush::countNonEmptyDroppedCollections() that needs updating too. The "2" clause in the loop specifically mentions collections with only prepares in them not triggering compaction.

Think the comment still holds true as the, situation we would hit with just prepares would be clause "1". Though think can re write some of the comments to make it a little clearer
