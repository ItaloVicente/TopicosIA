DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Ensure that Checkpoint::id is strict monotonic with no gaps

That invariant already applies, but this patch removes the ID input arg
from some checkpoint-create function, thus minimizing any chance of
error.

Why do I care about that? That's because in future patches I'll need to
use checkpint IDs for computing the distance between checkpoints. That
in turn for removing some O(N = checkpoint-list-size) proceedures.

Line:187, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Not directly related to this, but I think we should consider how we can make the checkpoint manager have zero checkpoints in it.

For example, consider the case with replica vBuckets where they have just finished streaming a complete checkpoint, but no more mutations have arrived yet (e.g. backfilling when there are no front-end ops). Today, we cannot close that finished checkpoint (and hence free up the memory) as CheckpointManager assumes that there's always at least one (open) checkpoint.

If we relaxed the constraints on CheckpointManager so we don't _have_ to always have 1 checkpoint, we could potentially delete such a checkpoint. This could potentially be replica-only behaviour.

Line:187, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Indeed, that's a piece of investigation that has already planned for https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-39344.

To date the invariant in CM is that the CheckpointList is never empty. The ternary operator here is to deal with the Checkpoint ctor that uses this function for creating the first ckpt.
I don't see too much pain for removing the invariant. Obviously we need to go through all code paths in CM that rely on that.
