DESCRIPTION:

MB-33549: add tests for all EPStats

Ensure that we test that all EPStats' stats are both
initialized and reset to the correct values.

Some of these tests are currently disabled and will
be enabled in a later patch.

Line:964, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> Style: Given you don't use nonDefaultOSStream anywhere apart form here, nicer to just assign it directly here (minimise distance between defining and using things).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:964, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> Reviewed this part offline, timingLog is a raw pointer / manually freed at ~EPStats(), so this patch causes double-free.
@dougie Maybe the first thing to do is checking out why EPStats::timingLog is a raw pointer and whether we need that. If not, we can consider to make it a reference or a smart pointer, depending on its lifetime
