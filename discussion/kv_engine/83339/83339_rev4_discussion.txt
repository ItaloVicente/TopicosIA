DESCRIPTION:

MB-25938: Create a copy of the xattrs before modifying them

When xattrs needs to be modified during a subdoc cmd, the xattrs blob
must be owned.

In this commit, we create a temporary copy of the xattrs, write to it
and then replace the xattrs of the doc with the temporary modified
copy.

Line:80, include/xattr/blob.h -> I saw this yesterday and thought copy constructor was disabled for a reason.

So can we add a new coding guideline:
Either define a deep copy ctor.
(OR)
Delete the copy ctor and leave a note that it can be implemented in the future when needed or why it should not be implemented.

I mean just setting the copy ctor to delete may imply that it should not be implemented for the class (as against that it was not needed when the class was first implemented)

Line:80, include/xattr/blob.h -> The reason it was deleted was because I didn't have a need for one when I wrote the class, and the automatically generated one would be wrong. I don't like adding code we don't need, as it means we just add more "dead code" we would have to maintain when we want to refactor the internals or add more to the class.. in addition we would have to write additional test cases for stuff we don't need.

As of adding a comment or not.. I can't think of a good reason for why we can say that "this class can never ever in the future be allowed to have a copy constructor". The code should be a living organism and we should be able to revisit any statement at any point in time to see if it makes sense anymore.
