DESCRIPTION:

MB-38377: Use MockKVStore to make test runnable for magma

The test is suing MockFileOps to inject errors but we can use
MockKVStore to do this instead and allow the test to work for magma.

Failure of GoogleTest "GoogleTestVerification.UninstantiatedParameterizedTestSuite<STPassiveStreamCouchstoreTest>":

<pre>
[ RUN      ] GoogleTestVerification.UninstantiatedParameterizedTestSuite<STPassiveStreamCouchstoreTest>
..\kv_engine\engines\ep\tests\module_tests\dcp_stream_test.cc(4795): error: Parameterized test suite STPassiveStreamCouchstoreTest is instantiated via INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P, but no tests are defined via TEST_P . No test cases will run.

Ideally, INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P should only ever be invoked from code that always depend on code that provides TEST_P. Failing to do so is often an indication of dead code, e.g. the last TEST_P was removed but the rest got left behind.

To suppress this error for this test suite, insert the following line (in a non-header) in the namespace it is defined in:

GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST(STPassiveStreamCouchstoreTest);
[  FAILED  ] GoogleTestVerification.UninstantiatedParameterizedTestSuite<STPassiveStreamCouchstoreTest> (0 ms)
