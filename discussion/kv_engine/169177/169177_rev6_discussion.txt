DESCRIPTION:

MB-38377: Use MockKVStore in VBStateNotLostAfterFlushFailure

The test is suing MockFileOps to inject errors but we can use
MockKVStore to do this instead and allow the test to work for magma.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Oh no! The test is taking legal action :troll:

Line:4528, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> I _think_ this can be replaced with

 DoDefault()

to call the method set by `WillByDefault`

but equally explicitly stating it here does make it a bit more explicit so readers don't have to hunt for the ON_CALL

Line:4528, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Done. I wanted this feature which lead to the "forwardCommit()" to reduce the boilerplate but I couldn't find it in the docs that I was looking at. I think forwarding it on by default is a reasonable assumption to make but if anyone feels strongly to the contrary then could add this sort of thing back in.
