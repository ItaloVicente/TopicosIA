DESCRIPTION:

[FollyConnection] Change buffer handling

Given that we fire the frame_available to let the caller
drain all packets in the stream we no longer need a "queue"
of buffers as the "current" buffer will always consist of
a single buffer which is either "empty" or contains a
fragment of the next packet. We may then grow the buffer
to be able to keep the entire frame or move the fragment
to the beginning of the buffer.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Ok, so I think this reveals a problem with the current code / design. Currently we keep on draining the socket and fill the "queue" even if the connection is in a "blocked" state in a higher state. We should probably change that in the connection-layer.
