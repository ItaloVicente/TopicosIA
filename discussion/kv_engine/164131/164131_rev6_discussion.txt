DESCRIPTION:

MB-48915: Compute checkpoint-max-size on the exact num-vbuckets on node

Currently the computation accounts the capacity of the VBucketMap,
while we want an accurate computation on the actual number of
vbucket-objects managed by a node at any given time.

The way to achieve that is recomputing the new checkpoint-max-size every
time a vbucket is created or deleted in the VBucketMap.
