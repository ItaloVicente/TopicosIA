DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Remove 'keep_closed_chks' config param

The param allowed to keep closed-unref checkpoints around depending on
the system total mem-usage state with regard to the LWM.
Feature disabled by default and arguably ever used. Plus, by MB-46827
checkpoint memory recovery is driven by checkpoints memory ratios that
are completely unrelated from LWM.
