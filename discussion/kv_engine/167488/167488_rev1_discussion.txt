DESCRIPTION:

MB-50060: Fail compaction if prepare CompactKVStore fails

We need to fail a collection dropping compaction if the CompactKVStore
call fails over the prepare namespace. If we do not and the rest of
the CompactKVStore calls pass then we will fail to clean up the prepares
belonging to dropped collections in the DurabilityMonitors.
