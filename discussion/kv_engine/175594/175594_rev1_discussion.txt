DESCRIPTION:

Extend the executor with log information

The excutor didn't log anything so it was close to impossible
to know the current state of the executor (if it was running or
if it was running a slow task etc)

This patch logs:

  * The type of task it ran if it takes longer than 1 sec
    length exceeds 10 elements
  * The number of tasks executed on the thread every 5 minute

This shouldn't add too much overhead to the logs and help us
understand what's going on.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> typo?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I know that this is a test patch only for now, just some minor comments
Line:60, daemon/task.h -> In EP we do directly

    std::string getDescription() const = 0;
    
So we don't have the overhead of maintaining the enum.

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> oops.. Initially I also logged when the run queue exceeded 10 elements.. but figured I would nuke that as it could bloat the log..

Line:60, daemon/task.h -> I want to read out the type every time I run the instance and it needs to be valid _after_ the task has run.. By doing this I _don't_ have to create a temporary string object for every time I run a task, but only when it is slow...
