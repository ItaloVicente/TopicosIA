DESCRIPTION:

MB-48128: Fail MagmaKVStore getCollectionsManifest if NotExists

NotExists means that the KVStore does not exist (rather than
NotFound which means that the doc was not found). Currently a
NotExists error results in an empty manifest being returned with
the bool result set to true. This change brings the functions
behaviour in line with the corresponding function in CouchKVStore.
