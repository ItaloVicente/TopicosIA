Kept to format/stylistic commentary, but one thing I did note: there is a mish-mash of different print formats being used.  If we are settling on a minimum of Python 3.6, I would suggest the devs do a run through after these changes have been put in to convert most/all of the print statements to use f-strings for consistency and maintainability.
Line:40, engines/ep/management/cb_evict_key.py -> Probably should remove the space before the open parenthesis at the beginning.

Line:38, engines/ep/management/cbcompact -> With the enclosing parentheses, the backslashes are no longer needed (and in some cases can cause strange things to occur), they should be removed.

Line:142, engines/ep/management/cbepctl -> While it doesn't hurt, remove the extra space here?

Line:52, engines/ep/management/cbstats -> With enclosing parentheses, backslashes not needed and should be removed.

Line:58, engines/ep/management/cbstats -> No need for list() here (2to3 is being too pendantic in this case).

Line:64, engines/ep/management/cbstats -> No need for list() here (2to3 is being too pendantic in this case).

Line:65, engines/ep/management/cbstats -> See above.

Line:55, engines/ep/management/cbvdiff -> With enclosing parentheses, backslashes not needed and should be removed.

Line:59, engines/ep/management/cbvdiff -> No need for list() here (2to3 is being too pendantic in this case).

Line:71, engines/ep/management/cbvdiff -> No need for list() here (2to3 is being too pendantic in this case).

Line:91, engines/ep/management/cbvdiff -> With enclosing parentheses, backslashes not needed and should be removed.

Line:57, engines/ep/management/cli_auth_utils.py -> Unnecessary additional parentheses.

Line:81, engines/ep/management/cli_auth_utils.py -> Unecessary additional parentheses

Line:75, engines/ep/management/clitool.py -> With enclosing parentheses, backslashes not needed and should be removed.

Line:83, engines/ep/management/clitool.py -> No need for list() here (2to3 is being too pendantic in this case).

Line:494, engines/ep/management/mc_bin_client.py -> I'm a bit confused by this change, since in Python 3 items() returns an iterator already, so calling 'iter()' on it should be a no-op.  You should be able to remove the iter() call here.

Line:654, engines/ep/management/mc_bin_client.py -> Duplicate parentheses are unneeded.

Line:177, engines/ep/management/memcacheConstants.py -> No need for list() here (2to3 is being too pendantic in this case).
