At least some of the CV build failures are legit - for example clang-analyzer is flagging new warnings in some of simplejson's C code. 

I need to update the CV jobs to exclude non-kv_engine warnings. Not looked at the other issues yet.

The cv-perf failure (http://cv.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/kv-engine-cv-perf/6479/console) is due to the use of file(TOUCH) which wasn't used before. 

That builder has CMake 3.6.1 installed - if that's downlevel then the docker image needs upgrading to a newer one.

Windows error also looks legit - problem with the dependancy order:

 00:00:50.381 ninja: error: dependency cycle: kv_engine/engines/ep/management/cbvbucketctl -> kv_engine/engines/ep/management/CMakeFiles/cbvbucketctl -> kv_engine/engines/ep/management/cbvbucketctl

As a more general comment, what method did you use to convert these? If some (all?) files were by a tool then that's easier to assume correct; if some files were manually adjusted could you highlight them so we can focus review on them.

Please also add kv_engine_dev to the reviewers (the whole team is responsible for code-review).
Line:119, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> This seems to have been removed - was that deliberate?

Line:1, engines/ep/management/cb_evict_key.py -> I think we should be updating the hashbangs to `python3` so in dual-stack environments (e.g. macOS) the correct python interpreter is used.

The alternative would be to use `from __future__ import print_function` etc to allow the code to work in either version.

Most of these changes were done by the "2to3" script that comes with Python 3. I will post a separate set of comments with the changes I did by hand.
Line:119, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> Definitely intentional. I actually don't think it would have done anything in the past either, since the env var would only be set while CMake was running and nothing in the CMake files actually invoked any python scripts that I know of.

Line:1, engines/ep/management/cb_evict_key.py -> There's a lot of changes besides the use of the print function, so yeah, these should probably be explicitly python3. It's not necessary for the build, but would be useful for developers.

Line:8, engines/ep/management/cbepctl -> I removed this - exceptions are in the builtin package now. "import exceptions" is harmless in a normal script but it causes errors when building with Pyinstaller.

Line:51, engines/ep/management/mc_bin_client.py -> Same manual removal of references to the exceptions package.

Regarding the file(TOUCH) problem, that slave is unfortunately not one I have any control over. The main CV slaves have the newer version of CMake installed.

I believe the Windows dependency cycle is fixed with the in-flight change to tlm. I'm not sure how to handle that - I can't submit the tlm change until the corresponding voltron, couchbase-cli, and couchstore changes are also submitted. Do you have any suggestions?

You can link together changes across project by giving them the same ChangeId - that causes the CV scripts to check them out together.

However as you've already uploaded all of those patches that would require you to re-upload the changes (given the ChangeId is the changes' identity) which you probably don't want to do. Could you split off the specific fix needed for the dependancy order into it's own patch and upload (& merge) that first?
Line:119, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> Ok - I assumed it at least make the tests run via CTest use that env var, but that doesn't seem to be the case.

You might recall Voiker added the linked ChangeIds a while back; before Gerrit supported linking changes via topic names - so it was a pragmatic choice at the time given the functionality available to us.

 Given our version of Gerrit does now support that then we could use that mechanism instead; just requires whatever Gerrit config / CV changes. It also has the advantage we can merge all dependant changes with a single click.
