If you use the same Change-Id in all reviews the commit validation will check out all of them together and run the build with them (and they're linked from this page...)

I do know that, and this kind of situation is exactly why I argued against that CV design when it was first inplemented. There's no way to change a change-id after pushing to Gerrit. In this case it wouldn't have worked anyway, since I ended up needing to submit an earlier version of the tlm change some time ago, and I couldn't now propose a new tlm change with the same change-id. If CV used topics, this would be easy (Ken's recent script to replace the allprojects.py stuff does that).

Yeah, it's one of KV-Engine's (runs on physical hardware). I'll get someone in the team to update the CMake version (I think it just needs rebasing on our current couchbase-ubuntu16-04 docker image.
