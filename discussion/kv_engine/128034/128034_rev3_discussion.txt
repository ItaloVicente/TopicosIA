DESCRIPTION:

MB-37680: Simplify Backfill finishing logic

In both DCPBackfillDisk and DCPBackfillMemory, once the complete()
method is called the backfill state machine is Done - no more work is
needed. Calling run() on the backfill again will just immediately
return with status backfill_finished.

However, not all instances where complete() is called return
backfill_finished to the BackfillManager - some return
backfill_success, which means the BackfillManager treats the Backfill
as still being active and needs to track and re-run() it a final time
to have it removed from the activeBackfills list.

As such, simplify / make the logic consistent - whenever
Backfill::complete() is called the returned status should be
backfill_finished.
