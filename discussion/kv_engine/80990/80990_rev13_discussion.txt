DESCRIPTION:

MB-20940: [9/n] Tap Removal - TapConnMap

As part of Tap Removal, this patch removes the TapConnMap class.
In addition it removes classes that are soley referenced from
TapConnMap class.

The use of TapConnMap is also removed from EventuallyPersistentEngine.

The functions processAck, setTimeForNoop and registerCursor are also
removed from the TapProducer class as they reference TapConnMap.  The
setBackfillPhase function from the Consumer class and
processCheckpointCommand from the TapConsumer class, which calls
setBackfillPhase, are also removed.

With the removal of tapconnmap.h, the kv_bucket.cc needs to include
ep_engine.h to access EventuallyPersistentEngine.
