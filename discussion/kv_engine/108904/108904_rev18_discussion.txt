DESCRIPTION:

MB-32591: Trigger expelling to occur before cursor dropping

Currently checkpoint expelling is applied every time a vbucket is
visited via CheckpointVisitor::visitBucket.  This aggressive approach
means that items can be expelled from a checkpoint even if memory usage
is below the low watermark.  If a new DCP producer DCP stream creates a
cursor to send items to a consumer there is an increased chance that
items will have to be retrieved via backfilling, where previously they
would have been sent directly from the checkpoint.  Consequently
over expelling could unnecessarily degrade performance.

Therefore this patch changes checkpoint expelling to be triggered only
when ClosedUnrefCheckpointRemoverTask is run and the existing criteria
for cursor droping is satisified.

We first apply checkpoint expelling, then if the memory target is still
not met we perform cursor dropping.  The reason for prioritising
expelling over cursor dropping is that it is considered less disruptive.

Still need to review new tests, but some initial comments.
Line:121, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> You can reduce the indentation (and make this easier to read) by turning into an early return / break:

 if (memoryCleared >= amountOfMemoryToClear) {
     break;
 }
 // Rest of code continues here, 4 spaces to the left...

See https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#use-early-exits-and-continue-to-simplify-code

Line:124, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> Similar here, flip to:

 if (!vb) {
     continue;
 }

Now you're 8 characters to the left :)

Line:127, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_remover.cc -> No need to change now, but you can save some typing / line length by using auto:

 auto expelResult = ...

Line:25, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_remover_test.h -> Why is this header needed here? Can you move to .cc?
