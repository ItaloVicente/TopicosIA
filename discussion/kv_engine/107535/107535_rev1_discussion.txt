DESCRIPTION:

MB-33389 [SR]: Move replicationTopology to VBucket

To be able to persist the replicationTopology it needs to be read by
the flusher when forming the new vBucket state. This also needs
correct locking to avoid data races. It therefore has a similar
ownership model as VBucket::state, which is owned by VBucket.

To handle synchronization, use folly::Synchronized<> to allow read and
write access, moving the topology to the VBucket as the central source
of truth (the DurabilityMonitor only needs specific data out of it).

Line:554, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I assume that this is going to be called by the Flusher.
But, this synchronize only with 'topology', so we could end-up with persisting something like:

{state:vbucket_state_replica,topology:{active, ...}}

which is wrong as a replica VB shouldn't have any topology.

Am I wrong?

Line:2069, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> As per commit message:

> This also needs correct locking to avoid data races. It therefore has a similar ownership model as VBucket::state

Shouldn't we just read/write this new member under the existing stateLock (line 2059) ?

Line:531, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Is it strictly necessary to pull the topology out of DurabilityMonitor?
This kind of split-state sounds error-prone..
What is the problem with just calling DM::getReplicationTopology() ?

Line:531, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> We'd need to at least introduce a new lock for it (or Synchronised<>), and the outside world (i.e. VBucket) would need to be able to modify the topology (take a write-lock on it). That to me implies that actually the topology belongs in the vBucket, and changes just need to be published to interested parties (i.e. DM).

Line:554, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Note that in setVBucketState, if replica then we clear the topology (line 528).

Line:2069, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Two reasons for doing it this way:

1.  that would be putting two things under the same mutex when it's not necessary - for example if the vbState changes but not topology and vice-versa).

2. I'd /like/ to move `state` under a Synchronised<>, but this turned out to be non-trivial, as various places acquire a read lock on stateLock, then make deep function calls which later perform an (atomic) read on `state. This isn't incorrect, but it isn't possible with Synchroized - we'd need to pass down the call stack a reference to the (locked) Synchronized which is non-trivial.

As such, it'd like to use Synchronized<> here to not expand the scope of the existing scopeLock.

Line:2069, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Point 2) is clear (I also checked that option during my review).

Not sure about 1).

> for example if the vbState changes but not topology and vice-versa

It shouldn't be the case. Logically, 'topology' is part of vbState. Our implementation is not complete, but it seems to me that we are going to write topology at every VB::setState (even if the topology may remain the same). E.g.:

- pending->active : new topology if provided
- active->active: write new topology (maybe the new one is the same as the old one, but I imagine that we are just applying the new one)
- active->replica : reset topology
- etc..

Line:2069, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Fine, but I still don't want to increase the scope of stateLock given the problems we already have with it I mentioned previously.

As and when we migrate VBucket::state over to Synchronized I don't want to make it any harder than it is already!
