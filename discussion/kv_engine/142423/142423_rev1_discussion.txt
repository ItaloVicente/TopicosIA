DESCRIPTION:

Remove check on CheckpointId==0 in PassiveStream::processMarker

CheckpointID==0 is always false, as that quantity is a monotonic
starting from 1.

..
    // Note: this is the last moment in the CheckpointManager lifetime
    //     when the checkpointList is empty.
    //     Only in CheckpointManager::clear_UNLOCKED, the checkpointList
    //     is temporarily cleared and a new open checkpoint added immediately.
    addOpenCheckpoint(1,
                      lastSnapStart,
                      lastSnapEnd,
                      maxVisibleSeqno,
                      {},
                      CheckpointType::Memory);
..
}

Plus, any usage of CheckpointId=0 was logically removed in MB-31664.

Mmm yes I've noticed that one too time ago. For reference, at warmup:

1006      // The first checkpoint for active vbucket should start with id 2.
1007      uint64_t start_chk_id = (to == vbucket_state_active) ? 2 : 0;
1008      newvb->checkpointManager->setOpenCheckpointId(start_chk_id);

Lines 1006-1007 are from 2012, where CheckpointID=0 was used to identify the "initial checkpoint" at Replica (for handling StreamReqs from the view-engine).
Why "for active vbucket should start with id 2" is unknown to me, but I don't see why that given how CheckpointID works now.
Before those lines we have created a VBucket with CheckpointID=1, so I think that I can just remove 1006-1008.

I think that is fine to do, just didn't want to continue with this change under the assumption that it is never 0

Yeah sure, you're right on that, thanks for reminding about that code at warmup

For reference, there is other logic in CheckpointManager where actions are performed based on CkptID==0, so further cleanup is necessary.

http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/148563 removes any possibility of setting CheckpointId=0, PassiveStream touched in that patch
