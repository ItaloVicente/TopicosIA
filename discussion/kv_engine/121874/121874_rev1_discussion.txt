DESCRIPTION:

MB-37096: Debug CRT: Reduce EventuallyPersistentEngineTest default #VBs to 4

Follow-up to previous vBucket redcuction patch - tests using the
EventuallyPersistentEngineTest fixture construct the Engine in a
different way and hence don't pickup the reduced default max vBucket
count in the same way as tests using SynchronousEPEngine do.

As such, implement equivilent logic to drop max_vBuckets to 4 and
num_shards to 2 by default.

Also tweak num_shards for SynchronousEPEngine to also be 2 (instead of
1) - to ensure we still exercise multi-shard logic in tests.
