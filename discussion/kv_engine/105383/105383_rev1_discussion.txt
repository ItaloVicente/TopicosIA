DESCRIPTION:

OpenTracing prototype for Matt

This prototype allows you to hook into the OpenTracing
framework by having the client supply the parent span
context, and we'll add a single "execute" field
below that.

In order to use it you need to create:

   etc/couchbase/kv/opentracing.json

with the following two attributes:

   module - The shared object implementing the tracer
            API use
   config - The configuration to provide to the tracer

Ex:

  {
    "module" : "/opt/jaeger/lib/libjaegertracing.so.0.5.0",
    "config" : "/opt/couchbase/etc/couchbase/kv/jaeger.yaml"
  }
