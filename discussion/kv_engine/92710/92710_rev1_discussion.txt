DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Reduce max separator length to 5

To allow collection-aware clients to access default collection
documents we will permit them to encode a key which is

    <separator><key>

E.g.

    ::mydefaultcollectionkey

Recent changes to the flexible-framing encoding mean sometimes the max
key-length is now 255 bytes, internally KV has always restricted keys
to be 250 bytes, thus having a separator max of 255 means we can still
access all possible default keys using up to a 5-byte separator.
