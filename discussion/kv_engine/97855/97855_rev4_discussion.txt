DESCRIPTION:

MB-30552: Move tag string formatting into class UserDataView

Add a new class inside logtags.h to format data with ud tags.
This is to remove the requirement to format the string if that
log is not required.

-1 is just for the comments in logtags.h; the other comments are related to suggested follow-up:

So now we have this capability to wrap user data, we can actually expand / make the API safer by having functions which return sensitive user data (for example Connection::getUsername() here) return the UserDataView type instead of std::string / const char*.

As such, we no longer need to manually wrap instances where we /use/ the user data in a log message; instead any uses will automatically have the redaction applied if the object happens to be used in a log message (i.e. when operator<< is called on them).

To achieve this, you will probably find that you'll need to add additional methods to your UserDataView class; so it can act like a const_char_buffer where appropriate.

However, the net effect is that any places we currently "forget" to apply the tagging should be efficiently impossible; as the compiler is checking for us.
Line:46, cbsasl/plain/check_password.cc -> (Perhaps as a follow-up patch) - it would be nice if we could get rid of any remaining uses of tagUserData and just have a single way to tag user data for redaction.

In this case, you could use a std::stringstream object to build up the message instead of simply concatenation - as std::stringstream uses operator<< to join strings. Then we wouldn't need tagUserData() here.

Alternatively, if there's multiple places which use '+' to join strings; you could create a to_string(UserDataView) function (which wraps with the correct tags); and then simply invoke to_string() on the UserDataView object when concatenating.

Line:449, daemon/connection.cc -> ok - looks like there's at least one other instance using '+' to join; so the to_string() approach is probably preferable.

Line:197, daemon/sasl_tasks.cc -> With reference to the top-level patch comment, this is an example where if we had getUsername() return a UserDataView, then we can simplify and remove the need to manually / explicitly construct a UserDataView everytime we log the username.

Line:19, utilities/logtags.h -> Note you shouldn't need to include the "include/" prefix here - <memcached/...> should be sufficient.

Line:21, utilities/logtags.h -> You shouldn't need this in the public header anymore (this was one of the reasons for moving the definition of operator<< to the .cc).

Line:51, utilities/logtags.h -> This is a little inaccurate / misleading. The actual purpose is to ensure that when objects of this type are printed (via operator<<); they are surrounded with a tag to flag them as user data which is sensitive and should be redacted from the logs during log collection.

It seems to break if it is taken out of the header file because of these uses.

Line:61, utilities/logtags.h -> Could you be more specific than “it seems to break” - exactly what error do you see?
