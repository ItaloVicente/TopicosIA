Add a new class inside logtags.h to format data with ud tags.

log is not required.

Looks okay to me, add the rest of the kv_engine group please
Line:21, utilities/logtags.h -> Can you write a file-level comment on this to explain why the static method still exists

Line:45, utilities/logtags.h -> So couple of comments on the design you have here:

1. Having this owns a copy of the data we are taking a "view" on is somewhat inefficient. This class doesn't need to take a copy of the data; as it's lifetime is expected to be no greater than the wrapped data. 
2. Having this as a templated class is probably unnecessarily verbose - given all types I've seen you use it for boil down to a char* and length. 

Instead I would suggest changing to (a) non-owning and (b) non-templated:

* Make the class just hold a const_char_buffer (which is our canonical type equivilent to std::string_view) - this removes the need to template; and means we don't copy the data in the case of std::string.

If you still need to support multiple different types (std::string, C-style char*, etc...) then you can simply appropriate constructor overloads - however I think if you just have one which takes const_char_buffer there should be conversion operators for most of the types you need.

Line:52, utilities/logtags.h -> If you follow the above suggestion; this can be moved into a .cc file; removing the need to #include files from spdlog in the interface (i.e. this header).
