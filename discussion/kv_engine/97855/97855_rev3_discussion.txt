log is not required.

Looks good. One actual bug; and one suggestion to simplify the interface:
Line:117, auditd/src/audit.cc -> Style: I don't think there's a huge amount of value in the `logtags` namespace at this stage - UserDataView (to me) feels sufficiently unambiguous that we should just drop the namespace and shorten the call by 9 characters. 

What do you think?

Line:729, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Note that keys don't have to be null-terminated (and in fact could include nulls in them). As such, you still need to use keylen to construct a const_char_buffer; not just assume a C-style null-terminated string.

(Same in additional places below).

Line:117, auditd/src/audit.cc -> So yes that would seem to be a logical reduction, but there is already a cb namespace used elsewhere which, although may not confuse the program, may confuse a reader. Is it worth reducing to one separate namespace say cblogs::UserDataView?

Line:729, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Noted and will be fixed in next patch

Line:117, auditd/src/audit.cc -> So our convention is anything we namespace is under the top-level `cb::`.

Personally I think it's overkill to have a namespace (`logtags` in this instance) for half-a-dozen symbols - particulary given we have a relatively explicit name here (UserDataView).

My comment about shortening was ultimately about readability / ease of understanding - does:

 cb::logtags::UserDataView(...)

really add much more than:

 cb::userDataView(..)

?

I'd say that `logtags` is actually a poor choice of name, even *if* we chose to use a second namespace - it's describing how the thing is implemented; not *what* it does / is for. For example, I'd say "redact" would be a better choice if we really wanted a two-level namespace...
