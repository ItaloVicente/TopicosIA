DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: change signature for unknown_command

Change the signature to receive a const cb::mcbp::Request&, but
due to all of the unit tests which currently call that method
the easiest way was to create a new function and have the old
engine method wrap into the new one.

As an extra bonus we can mock the commands going through
the old interface ;)
