DESCRIPTION:

MB-45206: Fix logging in Connection::event_callback

In memcached a clean connection shutdown by the peer is caught as
BEV_EVENT_EOF.

But, bufferevent may generate composed events like BEV_EVENT_EOF |
BEV_EVENT_ERROR | BEV_EVENT_WRITING, whose interpretation is "error at
writing on a closed socket".

In that case we are currently logging the event as an error, while the
"error" part is just a consequence of a clean shutdown.

Fix logging in Connection::event_callback accordingly.

Line:886, daemon/connection.cc -> Wandering if it would be worth adding more information about the connection e.g. the connection description? The ID kind of gives this but the description is probably easier to read.
