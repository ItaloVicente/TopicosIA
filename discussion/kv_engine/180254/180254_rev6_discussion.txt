DESCRIPTION:

MB-51967: Fix unexpected fileSize for vBucket after warmup test failure

Magma previously experienced the following failure:
 Running [42/160]: file stats post warmup....
 ./kv_engine/engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc:2327 Test failed: `'
 (Expected `383386' to be less than or equal to `368640' - Unexpected
 fileSize for vbucket)

This was because the arbitrary-size buffer implemented in
https://review.couchbase.org/c/ep-engine/+/49282 was no longer
large enough.
