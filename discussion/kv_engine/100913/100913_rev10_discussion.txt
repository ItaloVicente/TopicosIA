DESCRIPTION:

MB-31664: Don't accept streamRequests when receiving disk snapshot

With the plan to remove the dedicated backfill queue, we want remove the
reliance on checkpointID of zero meaning that we are receiving a disk
snapshot.  Also vbuckets currently have a backfillphase flag which is
used to indicate whether an item should be added to the backfill queue
or not.

To keep functionality the unchanged after removing the dedciated
backfill queue, we want to temporarily fail a stream request from a
vbucket whilst it is receiving a disk snapshot.  Therefore we introduce
a receivingDiskSnapshot flag which is used solely for this reason.

Line:683, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> This feels over-complicated - can we not just call setReceivingDiskSnapshot(true) unconditionally in this function?

Line:210, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Prefer to set in the initializer list.

Line:2165, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Is this true? what if we rolled back to into a disk snapshot?

Line:447, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Please document - especially why this is a important state.

Line:683, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> I have removed the setting to false, when not a disk snapshot.

Line:210, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Done

Line:2165, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Yes - we need to this - see http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/77837/
got the original bug-fix where we did not get out of backfilling state after a rollback.

Line:447, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Done
