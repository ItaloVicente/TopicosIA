DESCRIPTION:

MB-31664: Don't accept streamRequests when receiving disk snapshot

With the plan to remove the dedicated backfill queue, we want remove the
reliance on checkpointID of zero meaning that we are receiving a disk
snapshot.  Also vbuckets currently have a backfillphase flag which is
used to indicate whether an item should be added to the backfill queue
or not.

To keep functionality unchanged after removing the dedicated backfill
queue, we want to temporarily fail a stream request from a vbucket
whilst it is receiving a disk snapshot.  Therefore we introduce a
receivingDiskSnapshot flag which is used solely for this reason.

Line:674, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> About the if-else tree below.

I assume that we want to keep the previous logic (i.e., temporary fail stream-reqs if we are backfilling). Given that for the consumer only the vb-seqno-0 backfill exists, I see:

[Before]
If the consumer is receiving a vb-seqno-non0 backfill (eg, Cursor Dropping at the Producer) we don't fail a stream-req

[After]
.. we do fail a stream-req, because we enter the first if-block and we do vb->setReceivingDiskSnapshot(true).

So we are actually changing the logic.

Line:699, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> Format: the indentation of this is wrong

Line:674, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> Good spot - have changed so we only fail a stream request on initial disk snapshot.

Line:699, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> I used git-clang-format.. so I think its correct?
