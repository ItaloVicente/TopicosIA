DESCRIPTION:

MB-30916: Ensure that the open checkpoint exists in CM::checkpointList

By logic:
- the open checkpoint exists always and is at position
  CM::checkpointList.back() (MB-30580)
- the CM::checkpointList is never empty (MB-30834)

I exploit the assumptions above to simplify the logic in
CheckpointManager.

With this change I ensure that the CheckpointManager::checkpointList is
always in one of the two following states:
- 1 open checkpoint
- [0, N] closed checkpoints + 1 open checkpoint
