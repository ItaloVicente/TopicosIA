DESCRIPTION:

Fix memory tracking for memcached on OSX

All test programs were unaffected by what is suspected is a change
in linker behaviour, hence the issue goes undetected. It seems that
the way that the platform_cb_malloc_arena (weak symbols) are linked
into memcached via memcached_daemon no longer results in those symbols
being present in the final memcached binary.

This is addressed by changing the linker definitions and the addition
of a run-time check that we are reaching the correct cb_malloc backend.

Line:889, daemon/memcached.cc -> I think this is also the case if using system malloc, correct? i.e. we just need to be linking cb_malloc_arena, memory allocator doesn't matter...
