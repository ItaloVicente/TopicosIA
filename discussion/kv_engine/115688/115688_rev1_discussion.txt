DESCRIPTION:

MB-36227: Make EPStats cacheline padded

One of the last members of EPStats (memUsedMergeThreshold) is hit
whenever we allocate or deallocate memory. This value currently shares
a cache line with the start of the Configuration object which contains
a mutex that is written to (to acquire it) every time we want to read
something from the configuration (at least every time we call
DcpProducer::step/maybeDisconnect). Remove the false sharing by making
EPStats cacheline padded.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's probably /also/ worth raising a patch to change DcpProducer::step to use a local copy of the config variables it uses (dcp_idle_timeout), then adding dcp_idle_timeout to DcpConnMap's config change listener to publish any changes to it to all connected DCP clients.

(Configuration isn't currently optimised for frequent, common accesses - the expectations is that if clients want to read values frequently they should take a local copy and then add a ValueChangedListener if they need to be notified of changes in the config value).
