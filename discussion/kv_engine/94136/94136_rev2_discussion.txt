DESCRIPTION:

MB-25822: notifyStreamReady: Only notify conn on first added stream

DcpProducer::notifyStreamReady(vbid) is called when there is new data
available for the given vBucket. Currently this function schedules a
wake up for the underlying connection if ready.pushUnique() returns
true - i.e if that stream (vbucket) wasn't already ready to be
processed.

However, analysis of phosphor traces shows that we end up flagging a
connection for wakeup multiple times - one per outstanding
vBucket. While this is functionally safe (all but the first wakeup is
ultimatly ignored), it has a non-zero performance cost:

1. Each call to BufferLog::unpauseIfSpaceAvailable() (currently per
   vBucket) calls ConnMap::notifyPausedConnection(schedule=true);
   which adds an element to ConnMap::pendingNotifications.

2. The DcpConnNotifier (NonIO) task calls notifyIOComplete() for each
   element in ConnMap::pendingNotifications, which requires acquiring
   pending_io.mutex for each element. However, these are added to a
   map (keyed on Connection), so all but the first is essentially
   ignored.

Local testing showed up to 183 items being added to
ConnMap::pendingNotifications; when there was only a single DCP
connection. That is a non-negligible number of duplicates; each of
which requires a mutex to be required.

Given we only actually process the first wakeup for a given
connection; change DcpReadyQueue::pushUnique() to only return true if
the queue was previously empty. This means that we only call
BufferLog::unpauseIfSpaceAvailable() once per connection.
