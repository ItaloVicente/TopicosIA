DESCRIPTION:

MB-33959: Extract common chain creation/validation into new functions

We can re-use most of the chain validation and the chain creation code
for the secondChain (to be added).

Also, add chain number to exception messages where possible for
easier debugging.

Line:83, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Not sure why you changed that, I think that we can keep as it was, look at the comment below.

Line:99, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Actually you check this, which is wrong for SecondChain.
So, just keep the check only if ChainType::FirstChain

Line:504, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> I don't care about the name (fine to change if you like :) ), but I don't see the reason for pulling stuff out from this function.

We can just keep as it is, and initializing this->secondChain when is the time.

Note also that it is good (1) resetting the topology (FC/SC) and (2) "Apply the new topology to all in-flight SyncWrites" in the same function as they are a single (logic) atomic operation.

Line:189, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> We can check for FirstChain only, given that we distinguish between FC and SC in this function

Line:195, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> Using an enum{FirstChain, SecondChain} would be less error-prone

Line:504, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Why not keeping the function as it is and just setting the secondChain here?
The original function takes 'topology' in input, so you have everything for setting both FC and SC.

Also, the vector-stuff will not be duplicated in that case.

And, we should (if it's possible) keep reset the topology for all in-flight Prepares in the same function in ADM::State::func, as it ensures that the operation is atomic (as you must have acquired (and never releases) the locked-state for doing that).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:99, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> We decided that this was okay yesterday, ns_server should not send a secondChain instead of sending an empty secondChain (which is what this check does)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:504, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> I was trying to pull out the vector stuff given that it's common.

I've changed this to do the state change in a single function like before but kept the makeChain to so that I can re-use it for secondChain
