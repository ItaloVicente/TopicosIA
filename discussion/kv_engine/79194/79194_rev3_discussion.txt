DESCRIPTION:

MB-23529: Fix doWorkerStat data race

This race appears to be caused by GGC's buggy string COW as seen
multiple times, e.g., MB-23454.

doWorkerStat calls getLog/getSlowLog to get a vector of TaskLogEntrys,
which have been copied out of the tasklog ringbuffer of a given
ExecutorThread. These copies logically have copies of the original's
`std::string name`.

Once the ringbuffer is filled and begins overwriting older entries, the
deletion of the old `std::string name` races with doWorkerStats reading
the COW'd copied name.

This is resolved in this patch by adding an explicit copy constructor to
TaskLogEntry which forces a copy of the std::string name (in the same
manner as MB-23454).
