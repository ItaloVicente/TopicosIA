DESCRIPTION:

Add WeakPtrBag

An unordered collection which is implemented as a thread-safe vector of
weak_ptrs.

The motivation for this is to have a method like 'getAllExistingTasks',
such that we can orchestrate the execution of tasks relevant to unified
caching across all buckets without making the core aware of the
individual tasks' existence.
