DESCRIPTION:

Add WeakPtrBag

An unordered collection which is implemented as a thread-safe vector of
weak_ptrs.

The motivation for this is to have a method like 'getAllExistingTasks',
such that we can orchestrate the execution of tasks relevant to unified
caching across all buckets without making the core aware of the
individual tasks' existence.

Line:46, utilities/weak_ptr_bag.h -> Style: avoid wildcard reference capture in lambdas (in production code), as it can (potentially) capture things which are out of scope by the time the lambda executes; and also wildcard capture can make it less clear what state is being captured by a lambda.

In this case I don't believe you need to capture _anything_ so you can remove the wildcard.

(aka default to an empty capture in production code; only capturing the variables  you actually need.)

Line:72, utilities/weak_ptr_bag.h -> Again, I don't think you need to capture anything here.
