DESCRIPTION:

MB-35458 [SR]: Rename CompletedQueue -> ResolvedQueue

The name "CompletedQueue" is ambiguous and potentially misleading:

- The SyncWrites it contains are not /yet/ Committed / Aborted in the
  VBucket, they are just ready to be completed.

- With a forthcoming change to move the actual Commit / Abort into a
  background task, SyncWrites may reside in the queue for a time
  (hopefully briefly) after the function which moved them into the
  queue has returned.

To hopefully make the processing clearer, rename the queue to
ResolvedQueue, giving a SyncWrite lifecycle of:

    Prepared -> Resolved -> Completed

- Prepared: SyncWrite has been accepted into the DurabilityMonitor,
  and is awaiting sufficient nodes to acknowledge it within the
  timeout period.

- Resolved: SyncWrite has either met the durability requirements
  (sufficient nodes have ack'd it) and should be Committed, or it has
  exceeded the timeout and should be Aborted. SyncWrite is moved from
  trackedWrites into resolvedQueue.

- Completed: SyncWrite resolution (Commit / Abort) has been applied to
  the VBucket, and hence the SyncWrite has reached the end of it's
  lifecycle.
