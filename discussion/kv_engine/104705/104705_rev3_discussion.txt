DESCRIPTION:

MB-32974 [SR]: Add consumer_name to DCP_OPEN

Update DCP_OPEN handling in memcached to check for and validate a JSON
value.

Update ep-engine to check if the JSON value contains the key
'consumer_name' (for Consumer connections), and if so use that as the
consumer_name when negotiating control messages with the producer.

Assuming ns_server support
(i.e. http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/104483/), this allows ns_server
to correctly set the toploogy and node names and for multiple replicas
to be supported for SyncWrites.
