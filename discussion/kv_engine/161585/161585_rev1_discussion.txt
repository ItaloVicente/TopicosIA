DESCRIPTION:

Remove parameterized test suite KVStoreParamTestSkipMagma

It was never instantiated, and causing googletest 1.11.0 to fail:

 RUN      ] GoogleTestVerification.UninstantiatedParameterizedTestSuite<KVStoreParamTestSkipMagma>
../kv_engine/engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc:1536: Failure
Parameterized test suite KVStoreParamTestSkipMagma is instantiated via INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P, but no tests are defined via TEST_P . No test cases will run.

Ideally, INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P should only ever be invoked from code that always depend on code that provides TEST_P. Failing to do so is often an indication of dead code, e.g. the last TEST_P was removed but the rest got left behind.

To suppress this error for this test suite, insert the following line (in a non-header) in the namespace it is defined in:

GTEST_ALLOW_UNINSTANTIATED_PARAMETERIZED_TEST(KVStoreParamTestSkipMagma);
