DESCRIPTION:

Revert "MB-31869: Disable FlowControl for DCP Consumer"

This reverts commit 7532b05fdb3fe3710ff89c1fc57ea46c86a9f0ec.

Original reason for revert: Disabling FlowControl is ok but must be done *after* we disable the DCP Buffer at Consumer (http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/101187).
The reason is that with the current implementation the DCP Buffer at Consumer is part of the FlowControl implementation itself. Disabling FlowControl while keeping the DCP Buffer may overload the Consumer in DGM scenarios (up to getting that node killed for OOM).

Final reason for revert: MB-31869 has been deferred.
