DESCRIPTION:

KVBucketTest: Add flushVBucket()

Add a new helper method flushVBucket(Vbid) which flushes the given
vBucket to disk, returning the number of items flushed.

This is a variant of the existing flush_vbucket_to_disk(VBid, int
expexted) method - it performs the same task, but returns the number
of items flushed instead of ASSERT()ing the count itself.

The new method has a couple of advantages compared to
flush_vbucket_to_disk():

1. The caller is not forced to specify the number of items which are
   to be flushed. This can be helpful if either the number of items
   flushed doesn't matter, or is variable.

2. Any mismatch in expected vs actual items is reported in the context
   of the caller, instead of the callee. This makes it easier to see
   from GoogleTest's log messages where a particular expectation
   failed, particulary if the test has multiple calls to flush a
   VBucket. This also allows a context-specific log to be appended.

For example, the new method gives log messages like:

    tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_eraser_test.cc:1025: Failure
    Expected equality of these values:
      3
      flushVBucket(vbid)
        Which is: 2
    Should have flushed initial create collection + one mutation

i.e. referring to the line in the specific test case, plus with a
context-specific message. Compare to the message from
flush_vbucket_to_disk():

    tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc:227: Failure
    Expected equality of these values:
      expected
        Which is: 3
      actualFlushed
        Which is: 2
    Unexpected items (2) in flush_vbucket_to_disk(vb:0, 3)

The file / line number just refer to the flush_vbucket_to_disk()
method, giving us no context _which_ call to that method failed.
