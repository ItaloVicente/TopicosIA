DESCRIPTION:

Remove superfluous testsuite

memcached_testapp contains tests which test the functionality
(in addition to that this is testing the memcached style buckets
which is deprecated and we don't do any development on the
engine so we don't need a "simpler" way to test each function
without having to go over the wire)
