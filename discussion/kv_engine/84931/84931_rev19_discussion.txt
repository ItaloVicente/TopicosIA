DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: [1/N] Test for Hash Table Investigation

The test populates a hash table and then performs a sequence of gets
before evicting down to the low watermark.  The test is used to evaluate
the performance of the hash table eviction algorithm.

At the end of test it produces output stating for each document whether
it remained resident or was evicted.

The output can be fed into the accompanying visualisation script, which
produces a png file.  Each 10x10 pixel represents a document, and
indicates whether it remains in the hash table or has been evicted.

Note: The test is DISABLED as it is only to be run manually.

(10 comments)

Looks good. Few minor comments / suggestions.
Line:274, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> Given "eviction" means a few different things in KV-Engine, maybe rename to "hash_table_eviction_test" ?

Line:37, engines/ep/scripts/evictionVisualiser.py -> Style: Often easier to read block comments if you put a space after the hash symbol.

You could also consider a multi-line docstring (see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) given this is essentially a module-level comment.

Line:618, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> item ?

Line:30, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/eviction_test.cc -> Include order is incorrect - <gtest> (external library header) should be after the local headers, but before system headers. See Coding Standard for details.

Line:88, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/eviction_test.cc -> Please could you document what these parameters are.

Line:111, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/eviction_test.cc -> Might also be interesting to add an ephemeral variant in future...

Line:204, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/eviction_test.cc -> Note: The checkpoints will likely consume some memory if the flusher isn't running while you do a population phase. If you want more accurate numbers in terms of how full the hashTable is, you could consider running the flusher inside your while() loop above.

Another option would be to run this test for Ephemeral buckets - as they don't have a flusher you don't have that to worry about, and would simplify things somewhat.

Line:221, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/eviction_test.cc -> Nit / style: I'd move this down to where it's first used (line 229).

Line:236, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/eviction_test.cc -> low

Line:263, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/eviction_test.cc -> Nit: this function name feels a bit vague / terse - maybe expand to make clearer to reader?

Line:37, engines/ep/scripts/evictionVisualiser.py -> Decided to go with the space after hash, as the multi-line docstring caused my editor to not treat each line as a comment.
