DESCRIPTION:

Test for Hash Table Investigation

Test that populates a hash table and then performs a sequence of gets
before evicting down to the low watermark.  The test is used to evaluate
the performance of the hash table eviction algorithm.

At the end of test it produces output stating for each document whether
it remained resident or was evicted.

The output can be fed into the accompanying visualisation script, which
produces a png file.  Each 10x10 pixel represents a document, and
indicates whether it remains in the hash table or has been evicted.
