DESCRIPTION:

MB-45066: Add userConnection to test suites

Add a "userConnection" to all suites based off TestappXattrClientTest
which authenticates as "Luke" and select the test bucket.

This reduce the number of connections being used by all of the
test suites based off these suites at the cost of an extra
hello call to set the correct features in "SetUp"

This reduced the number of sockets to 2827
