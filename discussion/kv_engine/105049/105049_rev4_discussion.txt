DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Calculate a checkpoint's low seqno only once

This refactor is required for a future patch where items are expelled
from memory if all current cursors have iterated past.

Currently a checkpoint's low seqno is calculated each time the call to
getLowSeqno is invoked.  It uses the CheckpointIterator ++ operator
which skips past entries in the checkpoint queue that are null
pointers.

When items are expelled it will result in settting entries in the
checkpoint to null, and so when invoking getLowSeqno it will return
the lowest seqno of an item that has not been expelled.  This is not
what we want.

Instead we want getLowSeqno to always return the lowest seqno for the
checkpoint, regardless of whether the item has been expelled or not.
This patch ensures that this will always be the case.
