DESCRIPTION:

Add support for using Folly for event IO

In order to test it in a full deployment one needs to export
the environment variable CB_USE_FOLLY_IO (or get ns_server
to inject "event_framework" : "folly" in memcached.json

Modified cluster_test to run with the folly backend (to verify
that it works)

Line:1074, daemon/connection.cc -> Does this mean we don't support TLS connections with Folly yet? If so suggest mentioning that in the commit message.

Line:1178, daemon/connection.cc -> Uncomment or delete.

Line:162, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> Maybe rename now?

Line:194, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> I guess ideally we'd handle a list of IOBufs "as is" in much of the front-end of KV-Engine - say as far as the command context parsing out data and calling into the bucket to allocate an Item - then we'd only need to perform one copy when we finally create the Item / Blob in the engine?

Line:267, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> What are these Header pointers pointing into - the `bytes` vector below?

Line:320, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> Is is possible to avoid copying the data here, and just have folly take a reference to the `data` passed in - or perhaps transfer ownership to folly?

Line:329, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> Ah - looks like this is the version which takes a reference to a buffer. Suggest documenting these two overloads to tell the reader which does what (and which is preferred?)

Line:810, daemon/settings.cc -> I assume this isn't dynamic - can we actually change it at runtime?

Line:32, daemon/settings.h -> I think for GTest's argument-dependant lookup, to_string() needs to take a const reference to the type (even for primitive types like enum).

Line:1074, daemon/connection.cc -> Done

Line:1178, daemon/connection.cc -> Done

Line:162, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> Done

Line:194, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> Yeah, but in order to get there we need to either do:

   a) wrap all of the current bufferevent returned buffers into folly::IOBuf
   b) Complete the transition over to folly... 

Things gets easier once we have a working implementation of folly which is in the same ballpark as bufferevents so that we can move over and start optimizing the code the way we want.

Line:267, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> so it was a _plan_ I had in order to get better hints for memory allocation and only perform "parsing" once (as part of receiving the buffer I could parse as much as I received to know if I just had a partial message at the tail and how much I should allocate etc)... Nuked it to fix this separately later on

Line:320, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> This is basically a "push down" of the API the connection provides.

Line:329, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> As the one above it is a push down of the API that the Connection class provides. I'll update the docs

Line:810, daemon/settings.cc -> You can do that.. then new connections will use folly :) (existing connections will of course continue to use bufferevent)

Line:32, daemon/settings.h -> We don't do that for other "primitive enums" (I took a copy'n'paste from elsehwere).

I verified that our logger printed out the correct name from using {}, and that was what I really needed it for.. guess that's probably the latter of these two methods)

Line:810, daemon/settings.cc -> Ah, interesting!

Could be useful for A/B testing of this ;)
