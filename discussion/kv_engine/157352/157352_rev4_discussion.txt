DESCRIPTION:

MB-46827: Track bucket checkpoint mem-usage in EPStats::coreLocal

For limiting the checkpoint mem-usage we need to checkout the
checkpoint memory status on frontend threads. So, any expensive way of
getting that information must be avoided.

We add a new estimate of the checkpoint mem-usage in EPStats::coreLocal
and use that. Writes are being fast and reads requires a few iterations
on threads-local for computing the aggregate.

In the estimate we account for the memory of items queued in the
checkpoint and for the allocation in the key-index.

Partial review - still need to look at test changes
Line:742, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Style: I don't think "EP" prefix is particulary useful here; given this is inside Checkpoint.

Line:747, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Probably cleaner / less invasive to name these operator+= and operator-=.

Line:88, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> Can you expand this description a little - particularly how accurate / inaccurate the estimate is - what's included and what isn't included.

Line:742, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Done

Line:747, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> I've tried that option too but we end up with something like 

    EPMemoryCounter& operator+=(size_t)

which I didn't particularly like as that involves operands of different type.
Also, 'local' is an atomic underneath, so add/sub seemed consistent with fetch_add/fetch_sub. But that's just aesthetic.

So sure, can do if operators feel cleaner

Line:88, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> Done

Line:747, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> re: different type, that's exactly what NonNegativeCounter already does ;)

The main motivation for me to use operator += is it makes the patch smaller, and hence less chance of error - we don't need to change any of the call-sites which currently use += / -=.

Line:2809, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Not sure I underdstand the use of std::async here. You're creating a future using async launch policy, and then calling load in the main thread; however three's no guarantee on the order of those two load() calls - or even any guarantee they actually run concurrently. 

This seems unnecessarily complex - this test is doing a lot of things at once, if it started failing later on I suspect it would be tricky for someone to debug.

Can you look at breaking this test into a number of smaller ones?

Line:2812, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> A bunch of these should probably be ASSERT_EQ, given if they fail then the test is probably not meaningful.

Line:2827, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> As above, the expel section would be better placed in it's own testcase.

Yeah not necessary as we are not testing the CoreStore functionality here. That was for what I've described above at line 2768 "We are checking a core-local in this test, increase the likelihood that we load in parallel from multiple threads". But again, there's no guarantee that running on multi/different cores happens, so I'm just simplifying as you said.
