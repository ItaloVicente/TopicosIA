DESCRIPTION:

MB-35410: Update datatype on wholedoc operation

Wholedoc ops (as part of a subdoc multimutation) can replace the entire
document - potentially with a new value which does not match the
current datatype. E.g., existing json document replaced with non-json
raw bytes.

The datatype should be updated in this case.
