DESCRIPTION:

MB-51962: Add support for internal server cert

Map email addresses internal@internal.couchbase.com to
a user named @internal. This user does not have access
to any buckets, and no privileges. Its sole purpose
is to allow the internal components to connect to
memcached over TLS when the encryption mode is set
to mandatory. They would then have to authenticate
to memcached by sing SASL.
