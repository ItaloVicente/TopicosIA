DESCRIPTION:

MB-48816: Avoid unsafe use of cookie from background tasks

Previously, StatCheckpointTask and StatDCPTask immediately wrote
responses when collecting stats while on a background thread.

TSAN reported this as unsafe; no locks prevent potential racing with a
frontend thread manipulating the cookie.

Change both tasks to accumulate task values, but leave the frontend
thread to actually write the responses when it resumes the
ewouldblock'ed operation.

TSAN Report:
