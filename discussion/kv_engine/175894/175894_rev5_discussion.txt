DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor] Modify the way to verify SCRAM client proof

Use the client proof to generate the ClientKey and hash
it to get the StoredKey

This is a preparation for keeping ServerKey and StoredKey
instead of the hashed password locally

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Is it?
I see that we change some quantities in the computations, eg we move from using salted-passwd to using stored-key, which are 2 different quantities by definition.

Also, why that change doesn't fail any unit test?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> It is an internal refactoring on how to verify that the client used the correct password as the input when generating the ClientProof.

Previously the server would run the same logic as the client (but use its own version of the salted password) and build up the ClientProof and compare that the one generated on the server was the same as the one the client generated. This is now changed to take the ClientProof the client sent me, XOR that with the ClientSignature built up during the handshake to get the ClientKey and hash that to get the StoredKey and compare that with the one we generated on the server (which is to be provided in the config later on)

If any unit tests would fail we would be doing something incorrect as this is all internal details (on how to verify that the ClientProof the client sent is built up by using the correct password).
