DESCRIPTION:

MB-30119: Fix errors reported by ASAN after forcing C++14

* We're using operator new to allocate the size of the StoredValue
  object, so we should use operator delete to release the memory
  as well (otherwise asan reports mismatch of allocation and
  release size)

* Base class should have a virtual destructor

Line:131, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> I don't believe this should be necessary - I believe this is doing exactly what the compiler-generated operator is doing.

Line:845, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> ditto

Line:131, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Without it ASAN complaints, with it it works ;)

Line:131, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Hmm - something seems wrong then - all deletes should go via the deleteImpl() method below which you can see already adds the appropriate typecast. Can you point me at a backtrace where this gets called?

Line:131, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> ok, so I think I see how this "fixes" the warning - by defining this we force the class to be deleted using the non-sized operator delete. Normally it will call the sized one and that's why it warns:

 Continuing.
    #0 0x7ffff6efca18 in operator delete(void*, unsigned long) (/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libasan.so.4+0xe1a18)
    #1 0x14c4890 in StoredValue::Deleter::operator()(StoredValue*) /home/daver/repos/couchbase/server/kv_engine/engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc:254
    #2 0x1383ee5 in TaggedPtrDeleter<StoredValue, StoredValue::Deleter>::operator()(TaggedPtr<StoredValue>) /home/daver/repos/couchbase/server/kv_engine/engines/ep/src/tagged_ptr.h:143
    #3 0x1383ee5 in std::unique_ptr<StoredValue, TaggedPtrDeleter<StoredValue, StoredValue::Deleter> >::~unique_ptr() /usr/include/c++/7/bits/unique_ptr.h:268
    #4 0x1383ee5 in HashTable::clear_UNLOCKED(bool) /home/daver/repos/couchbase/server/kv_engine/engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc:124

I think the underlying issue here is that the object is created via a call to new() which is larger than sizeof(StoredValue); as we embed the key at the end of the fixed data. When the compiler / ASan calls operator delete(void*, unsigned long); it doesn't know this and passes in the fixed size.

Line:131, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Indeed, this what cppreference.com[1] says (note this is new in C++14) about how delete is called:

 ...
 * Otherwise, lookup reached global scope, and:
     * If the type is complete and if, for the delete[] only, the operand is a pointer to a class type with a non-trivial destructor or a (possibly multi-dimensional) array thereof, the global size-aware global function (with a parameter of type std::size_t) is selected
    * Otherwise, it is unspecified whether the global size-aware deallocation function (with a parameter of type std::size_t) or the global size-unaware deallocation function (without a parameter of type std::size_t) is selected

[1]: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/delete

So previously (C++11) we always had the non-sized delete() called; now we have the sized one called.

Based on all of this, I agree that the current solution in this patch (defining a non-sized class-specific delete()) is the correct one - but for a somewhat subtle reason - as discussed here.

Could you add a comment to both operator delete() functions explaining why need them please?
