DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Allow to retrieve Checkpoint items without moving the cursor

With this patch CM::getItemsForCursor() takes a new CursorMove param in
input. CursorMove allows the caller to specify if the cursor must move
when the function executes (CursorMove::SYNC, the default and usual
behaviour) or not (CursorMove::DEFERRED).
The returned result of the function is the same in both cases.

The new DEFERRED mode is added and tested in this patch, but not used
yet.

Line:83, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> if one were to do:

 CheckpointCursor a = ....;
 CheckpointCursor b = std::move(a);

Cursor `a` would still prevent e.g., checkpoint removal/expelling - it's still sort of "holding resources" after being moved out of.

It's fine in the sense that when `a` is destroyed it will still be released, but that might be a gotcha people don't expect given normal move semantics - the move is acting a like a copy.

In contrast, if the move constructor set

 other.isValid = false;

but did not do

 (*currentCheckpoint)->incNumOfCursorsInCheckpoint();

then after moving out of `a`, you can forget about it and it won't act like an valid cursor while it is in scope.

Also saves incr/decr-ing the counter for every move.

Not sure that what I suggested is necessarily a good idea, there might be guidelines in the area though :shrug:

Line:895, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> copy.emplace(*cursorPtr);

Might be better for in-place copy construction.

I think that currently would read as a copy then a move?

Line:83, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Actually given that this is move construction the example I gave isn't quite right. I think the point stands, just with

 CheckpointCursor b{std::move(a)};

or

 CheckpointCursor(std::move(a))

rather than the assignment? (I think).

Line:83, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Also, we don't have a clang tidy job for mad-hatter currently but I'd guess it will advise marking move construction as noexcept?

Line:83, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Couple of points:


1) The only reason why I added the move-ctor is for avoding the double copy of string:name when doing an assignment.
Which is probably minor/unnecessary given that the new logic is executed only at persistence.
Also, I think that we can rely on copy-elision when optimization is on.
Also, the boost::emplace that you suggested avoids the double-copy.
So just using boost::emplace and removing this.


2) We do need to perform incNum/decNum. That is very important for preventing the checkpoint remover from releasing checkpoints before the cursor is re-placed at the right position (ie, the deferred moved).
If we fail to do that, then the execution of CM::incrCursor(cursorCopy) could wrongly set numCursor=0 for checkpoints that we have not persisted yet.. you already know the consequence.


Obviously here I'm proceeding under the assumption that we don't want to touch the cursor-move logic in CM under this MB.

Line:895, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Good suggestion for boost::emplace, thanks.
And yes, currently is copy + move

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:83, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> :roger: sounds good.

Regarding 2) - as this was the move constructor, it would have been reasonable to make it so the moved-out-of cursor ceases to be counted in the checkpoint, and the moved-into cursor _starts_ being counted in the checkpoint.
The counter itself wouldn't need to be incr'd then decr'd if the moved-out-of cursor were made invalid; there would still be the same number of valid cursors in that checkpoint, the cursor has logically "moved" from one place to another.

As the move constructor stood, it was indeed necessary to incr, because the moved-out-of cursor *did not* become invalid - when it was destroyed it would have decr'd, so the incr was as you mentioned needed to prevent the counter being made too low.

It was fine as it was, I was just noting that that might be a "gotcha" if someone later used the move constructor without reading it. :)

As a toy example imagine someone writes

 CheckpointCursor a = ...; // create 1 cursor (only one in the checkpoint)
 {
  CheckpointCursor b(std::move(a)); // move a into b
  // b goes out of scope, destroying the cursor
 }
 // how many cursors are in the checkpoint now?

Following normal move semantics, someone might assume numCursors=0 at the end, where in reality it would be numCursors=1, because `a` is still in scope. `a` might have an invalid name but it is still "referencing" the checkpoint.
If it conveys it better imagine doing that example with a std::shared_ptr instead of CheckpointCursor - at the end you would expect `a` to be empty, and whatever it pointed to to have been destroyed when `b` went out of scope, because you explicitly moved a, rather than copying.

Not necessarily important, just seemed worth noting. Doesn't matter now that the move ctor is gone :P
