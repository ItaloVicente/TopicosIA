DESCRIPTION:

MB-37546: Allow to retrieve Checkpoint items without moving the cursor

With this patch CM::getItemsForCursor() takes a new CursorMove param in
input. CursorMove allows the caller to specify if the cursor must move
when the function executes (CursorMove::SYNC, the default and usual
behaviour) or not (CursorMove::DEFERRED).
The returned result of the function is the same in both cases.

The new DEFERRED mode is added and tested in this patch, but not used
yet.
