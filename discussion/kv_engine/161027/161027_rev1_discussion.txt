DESCRIPTION:

MB-41018: Refactor logging of status in case of magma rollback failure

Atm if magma needs to add a new status code, it involves a simultaneous
commit to magma and kv_engine since the buildbot fails with error:
enumeration value <new error code> not handled in switch.
This will also allow magma to add error codes without having to force push
patches without buildbot's +1.
