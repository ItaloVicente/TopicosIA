DESCRIPTION:

MB:30752: Remove Closed Checkpoint Collapsing

Closed Checkpoint Collapsing ("CCC" from now) was introduced in CB 2.x
for reducing memory usage on replica-vbuckets in the case where we have
many closed referenced checkpoints. That can happen if:

1) the Flusher is slow, so the persistence cursor is behind
2) an ActiveStreamTask is slow, so a replication cursor is behind

By collapsing closed checkpoints, de-duplication of repeated keys would
reduce memory usage.

Note that:
- the amount of memory released depends on the workload. E.g., we would
  de-duplicate a lot if clients are mostly updating the same set of
  keys; but, there would be no de-duplication at all in the case of a
  bulk-load (i.e., creations only)
- CCC is disabled by default (controlled by the 'enable_chk_merge'
  parameter in configuration)
- test coverage on CCC is poor
- Cursor-Dropping (introduced in CB 4.6.x) addresses the same issue as
  CCC for point 2) above

Thus, we remove CCC.
