Line:38, xattr/blob.cc -> This is actually going to be more expensive, as std::vector default-constructs all it's elements; however in this case that is unnecessary as we copy over them a few lines down.

If you really want to get rid of C-style arrays (and I don't think they are necessary a problem here given they are actually owned by a unique_ptr) you would need to look at replacing the underlying member-variable with std::vector or similar. However I don't think that's a particular priority.
