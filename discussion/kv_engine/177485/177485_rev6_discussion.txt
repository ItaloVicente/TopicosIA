DESCRIPTION:

MB-47267 / MB-52383: Make backfill during warmup a PauseResume task

(Note: this is a cherry-pick / backport of 423ad543e and 564986e3d from the
 cheshire-cat branch to mad-hatter.)

MB-47267 demonstrated that during warmup of a node in a cluster which
has multiple buckets of different sizes, smaller buckets could become
stuck behind larger buckets causing their warmup time to be much longer
than it need be. This can causes problems during delta node recovery as
NS_Server starts requesting vbucket stats to check vbucket state and
if this is not responded to promptly this will cause the rebalance to
timeout. Which may happen as EP-Engine does not service any vbucket
stats requests till we've completed 'PopulateVBucketMap' state of
warmup, which requires  one + five x the number of shards reader tasks
to have been run and completed. Though these tasks are relatively quick
to run, they can become stuck behind other bucket's warmup backfilling
tasks which can take upwards of minutes to run depending on the size of
the bucket. As they share the same reader thread task pool.

To fix this, this patch modifies the backfilling functionality during
warmup so that backfill may now be paused after a time deadline has
been met and store the seqno we've reached so that we can start
backfilling again when the tasks is rescheduled. Which in turn allows
the faster initial phases of warmup to have a chance of being run
between each run of backfill.  This patch unifies the functionality
of the backfilling stages of warmup so that the same code is used for
'KeyDump', 'LoadingKVPairs' and 'LoadingData' stages of warmup.

This patch also adds a test to ensure that, if we create a larger
bucket, and start warmup it up before a smaller one. With only one
reader thread that the smaller bucket is able to warmup before that
the larger one has finished warming up.

A ep_perfsuite test has been added to test warmup latency to help with
tuning of the maxDuration time for that a backfill can take before it's
paused.

MB-52383 highlighted an issue in the original patch for MB-47267;
WarmupVbucketVisitor::visit() was not yielding as expected as the
deadline was incorrectly not updated. That fix is included in this
patch.

Line:933, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> nit: feels like the local ref's name should be updated, as it's not designed to hang the thread anymore.

Line:8243, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> paranoid: Might be worth adding a check be that things have changed and we're running with 1 thread.

Line:8244, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Nit: not really sure why this is in it's own scope?

Line:8243, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Ideally, yes. Problem is there's no API to get this at the EnginIface API level - this is why I had to change this in the first place (there's separate ep.so and ep_testsuite.so shared objects in mad-hatter).

Given this is a backport onto a stable branch (and hence we would not expect any changes like the FollyExecutorPool to occur) which would affect how thread counts are calculated, I'm confortable to trust the testing which was done during development - i.e. prior to the fix being applied, this test highlights the issue.

Line:45, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/thread_gate.h -> Would this not attempt to lock the mutex a second time from the owner thread in the case of a spurious wakeup? If so, I think it is UB. I don't think there is a need for a lock in isComplete.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:45, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/thread_gate.h -> Good question!

No, because the isComplete(std::unique_lock<>) overload (line 68) is called, so there's no second lock occurring. 

See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/thread/condition_variable/wait - we must acquire the mutex before calling wait() - as we do at line 43; other than that wait() handles the unlock / relock for spurious wakeups.

Line:45, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/thread_gate.h -> I know it relocks to allow other threads to proceed, but I thought the lock was held during the check, because why would it not be -- the lambda is supposed to contain a condition on the shared state. I don't see an example where a lock is used inside the lambda, but I will read a bit more. Thanks.
