Line:594, daemon/cookie.cc -> this should be externally seen as "UnknownCollection", maybe a new rbac error which can be mapped

Line:597, daemon/cookie.cc -> idea for the future (maybe profiling will guide us), we could change get_scope_id to take the CID, so on this path there is 1 LEB128 decode, rather than this one and one inside get_scope_id.

Line:669, protocol/mcbp/opcode.cc -> DCP commands which carry document keys will be able to carry collection keys. Mutation/Deletion/Expiry/Prep/Abort/Commit

Line:594, daemon/cookie.cc -> Not 100% sure if I agree... for select bucket we return EACCESS and not ENOENT for non-existing buckets... what we _could_ do is to add that to the extended information in the cookie error message?

Line:669, protocol/mcbp/opcode.cc -> Yeah I thought of that (I wasn't sure if we wanted to protect all of these behind dcp privilege or both)...

Line:180, engines/ep/src/collections/manager.cc -> For this function and callers usage, moving line 181:183 to be above the lock should suffice

Line:594, daemon/cookie.cc -> I would of thought if a client (QE will do this) write to invalid collection-IDs, a 'invalid' error (e.g. unknown collection) would be better than an access failure. From the KV design that's the assumption I think they will make.

I think for this case auth error codes should only be seen when a valid collection is used, but the client genuinely has no access rights.

Line:594, daemon/cookie.cc -> Is the argument here we could "leak" valid collection IDs to clients which don't have any access if we used UnknownCollection?

i.e. for a client which has access to nothing, they could probe various collection IDs.

* If they return UnknownCollection; then collection doesn't exist
* If they return EACCESS, then collection does exist.

Of course, I don't know how much of a real issue this is (it's the collection number not name), but it's potentially a vector of potential information leakage...

Line:594, daemon/cookie.cc -> yes. We only tell clients what they're allowed to see... I don't really want to change the check here (and introuce a new value to privilege access).. We _could_ change the validator to also validate this (and keep the scope around in the cooke for later use).

Line:594, daemon/cookie.cc -> This is going to break the current design that clients are working with. We have to work in co-ordination with collection create and drop, which are not atomic. The client can create a collection (and the collection has access for everyone), fire off CRUD operations and then use the unknown collection error resolution (where unknown collection also returns the manifest UID we failed a lookup against - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X-v8GWQjplrMMaYwwWOzEuP4AUoDNIAvS39NmEjQ3_E/edit#heading=h.rq4evbcnjrt1) to determine if an operation is a hard error (the collection was since dropped from manifest) or a retry (collection really does exist, just this node is not up to date).
