Line:60, auditd/generator/auditevent_generator.h -> Given that this is a read-only argument (isn't moved / re-bound) a cJSON& would be preferable as that can be checked statically instead of at runtime.

Line:60, auditd/generator/auditevent_generator.h -> part of this is really "annoying:, because the entire cJSON API always operates on a cJSON*, which means that by using cJSON& I'd need to add a & in front of the entire API.

If you really want me to change this to an object I can do that on top of this branch (as all this code is being moved to other files later on and it'll just cause conflicts I need to resolve)..

Line:60, auditd/generator/auditevent_generator.h -> Well, I was just referring to the function(s) you've changed here - given you are already changing the signature here from a raw ptr to gsl::not_null; it's just as easy to change to cJSON& in this instance.

If you're concerned about changing more lines than necessary, you can make the argument be a reference (with a different name) and then take a pointer to it as a local variable (using the previous argument name).

Line:60, auditd/generator/auditevent_generator.h -> To avoid having to rebase all of the patches (given that the code is being moved across files) I'll do a scrub on top of the patches. (I don't think its worth the extra effort trying to resolve all of the conflicts when the code is moved around).

Line:60, auditd/generator/auditevent_generator.h -> I started doing the refactoring, and I ended up changing my mind. Having it as a reference means that I have to dereference the pointer everywhere I call it... and I would have to add explicit checks to see if the pointer is a nil before doing so.
