DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: [2/N] Implement Tagged Pointer for unique_ptr to StoredValue

To improve our hash table eviction algorithm we need to hold more state
regarding when and how often documents in the cache are accessed.

However we do not want to increase the memory usage, especially as the
increase will be multiplied by every entry held in the hash table.

Given we maintain a 64-bit pointer to a StoredValue for each entry in
the hash table, on x86-64 architectures we can use the top 16-bits for
our own use.  This is because x86-64 only use the bottom 48 bits for
addressing.

This patch introduces a tagged unique_ptr class, which has the ability
to act as a pointer, as well as hold 16-bit of user data.  This class
is used for the chain_next_or_replacement pointer in a StoredValue.

Also needs a unit test for the TaggedPtr test - should ensure all the methods in it are covered.
Line:106, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Nit: Technically this is now an implicit ptr -> bool conversion - ideally should be:

 values[i].get().getObj() != nullptr

One alternative (which would maintain the previous API) would be to define an equality operator on TaggedPtr; then you could revert all these changes. Maybe take a look and see how it looks?

Line:429, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> Believe these can be reverted.

Line:94, engines/ep/src/tagged_ptr.h -> While the name is accurate, might be clearer to name it on the higher-level operation it performs, instead of the low-level mechanics - currently this offers little in the way of abstraction to the reader.

For example - rename to `extractPointer` or similar.

Line:104, engines/ep/src/tagged_ptr.h -> Similar here - how about `extractTag` ?

Line:479, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/basic_ll_test.cc -> Pretty sure these can be reverted also.
