DESCRIPTION:

MB-26470: Create 'Consumer Processor tsk' only before adding first stream

Currently we create the 'DCP Consumer Processor task' in the constructor
of the DCPConsumer obj. This is not fully safe because the DCPConsumer
passes a RCPtr of itself to the 'Processor task' even before the
consumer obj is fully created. If there is an exception in the
constructor then the 'Processor task' will be holding onto an
invalid reference. Further, it was also found that upon upgrading
RCPtr to std::shared_ptr, a std::bad_weak_ptr exception was thrown
if we tried to pass the reference ptr in the constructor.

Hence, this commit creates the 'Processor task' just before the
first stream is created on the consumer connection.

Line:264, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> i'm just wondering if this should go before we placed the new stream in the map? Is there any race where someone will now try an operate on the stream before the task is created?

Line:264, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Good point.. Though I can't think of such a race (since nothing would happen until addStream() and then streamAccepted() are executed), it wouldn't hurt to create the task before putting stream onto the map.

Will make the change and upload.
