DESCRIPTION:

MB-44140: Return status from CouchKVStore::readLocalDoc

We shouldn't assume the success of the CouchKVStore::readLocalDoc
function. We should pass the status back up to the caller. This patch
returns the status from the function but does not add any extra
handling in non-success cases. That will be added in a future patch.
