DESCRIPTION:

Create DCP consumer / producer without holding the lock

Previously we grabbed a write lock to the underlying map and
checked if we already had the cookie registered (which would
_ALWAYS_ fail as the core won't allow DCP open on a connection
which is already marked as DCP). After that it would check
if we had a connection with the same logical name before we
would create the object and insert it into the map.

We only need the lock while we check for the name and insert
the new stream.
