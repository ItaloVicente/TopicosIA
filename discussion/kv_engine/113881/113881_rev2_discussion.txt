DESCRIPTION:

MB-35604: Add ssl_cipher_suite for TLS>=1.3

OpenSSL use a separate API to configure ciphers for TLS 1.3.
For TLS < 1.3 you may use SSL_CTX_set_cipher_list which scans
the list of provided ciphers and selects the ones it supports
and ignores unknown ciphers. The method is considered as
successful if at least one cipher is selected. For TLS 1.3 one
needs to use SSL_CTX_set_ciphersuites and it will _fail_ if
it encounters unknown ciphers.

To work around this ns_server will provide two list of chiphers:

    ssl_cipher_list - list of ciphers to use for TLS < 1.3
    ssl_cipher_suites - ciphersuites to use for TLS >= 1.3

This patch also change the logic for what an empty string means.
Previously an empty string indicated that you wanted to use
whatever OpenSSL provided as default. With this patch an empty
string means: no ciphers.

Line:497, daemon/settings.h -> Can I suggest we name this method (and the associated config param) something like `ssl_cipher_suites_1_3` - it's going to be hard for ourselves / users to remember which one of `list` & `suites` is <1.3 and which is >=1.3

Line:37, daemon/ssl_utils.h -> Given neither of these is modified via the shared_ptr, prefer just passing a `const std::string*` - see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-smartptrparam

Line:497, daemon/settings.h -> With the current naming it maps to what openssl calls them (including the command line of the openssl binary)... Adding 1.3 in the name will make it harder to figure out which one to use once we have TLS 1.4... is that ssl_cipher_suites_1_3? or...

Line:37, daemon/ssl_utils.h -> The "problem" with that is that then they _have_ to be set... ifyou look in the method they may be "empty". If not set you'd get the "default" value set by openssl (I don't think it offers a lot of extra value converting to a boost::optional every time calling into here...)

Line:497, daemon/settings.h -> Well, I think _something_ other  than `list` & `suites` would be preferable - there's no indication at *all* which is the newer / older one.

Line:37, daemon/ssl_utils.h -> Sure, so can't you just pass a `const std::string*`, extracted by calling `.get()` on the shared_ptr ?

Line:497, daemon/settings.h -> That would end up in different naming than the openssl, which would lead to even more confusion?

Line:497, daemon/settings.h -> I think our users probably care more about a explicit, easy-to-use API for Couchbase than exactly matching OpenSSL's API naming (which IMHO is very unclear) - having a pair of methods which you basically have to go to the man page every time to know which one is for TLS 1.2 and which is for TLS 1.3+ is Bad Design!

Line:497, daemon/settings.h -> In this case the "user" is ns_server (as it will calculate this list). It is the one providing the API to the end user allowing it to specify the mix of ciphers. 

We can alternatively add:

"ssl_ciphers" : {
    "tls_1_2" : "list:of:ciphers:for:old", 
    "tls_1_3" : "list:of:ciphersuites:for:1.3"
}

That should be prepared for dealing with an API change for 1.4

(I could have added separate entries for tls_1[.1], but then I'd loose the preferred ordering).
