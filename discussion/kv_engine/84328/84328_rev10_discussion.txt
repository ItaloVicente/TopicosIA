Line:23, daemon/base_cookie.h -> I still think adding this class is just making things more complex, and I'm not sure if we really gain anything. 

I don't see what makes the tracing options more belonging into the cookie than the other fields we've got in the cookie. The cookie represents the context for a single operation, and holds the reference to the client who owns the command; the command itself etc.

Line:963, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> Move this to Cookie::clear() ?

Line:50, daemon/protocol/mcbp/hello_packet_executor.cc -> This flag should be stored in the connection object, and not the cookie. The cookie represents a single command (currently we only support one, but we're moving towards supporting multiple). 

The cookie should be initialised with this field when we initialise the command context for processing the next command.

Line:153, daemon/protocol/mcbp/hello_packet_executor.cc -> ditto

Line:224, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> we could have moved all of these into engine_wrapper.cc and get the same trace scopes for all bucket types?

Line:32, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> we shouldn't be including stuff from the daemon into the engine.. we should go through the server API to touch this..

Line:10, programs/engine_testapp/CMakeLists.txt -> do you really need this explicit dependency? won't target_link_libraries add that automatically?

Line:12, programs/engine_testapp/CMakeLists.txt -> put this before malloc libraries

Line:7, utilities/CMakeLists.txt -> Alternatively we could put this into its own lib?

Line:23, daemon/base_cookie.h -> Across, application code & tests, the cookie type is different(atleast 5 different types). I understand we have had a void* everywhere for a while which has enabled us to pass in completely different types. I suppose you are suggesting that other cookie types derive from Cookie rather than BaseCookie. In that case, help me out on abstracting out the MbcpConnection from the current ctor for Cookie. We would have to have a ptr to MbcpConnection rather than a reference as most of the test code dont have that object. Let me know what you feel about this.

If we should NOT type cast in the bucket code via the BaseCookie, then we have to do tracing via server api, is that what you are leaning towards?

Line:224, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> We can move as many possible to that !!

Line:10, programs/engine_testapp/CMakeLists.txt -> Done

Line:12, programs/engine_testapp/CMakeLists.txt -> Done

Line:7, utilities/CMakeLists.txt -> do you really want to have a separate library for this? Or do you want to add it to another library

Sorry for the late answers...
Line:23, daemon/base_cookie.h -> A while back I added a protected constructor to McbpConnection which allows you create an instance of te cookie without binding it to a socket... 

See: http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/kv_engine/tests/mcbp/mcbp_test.h#55 

That test also use it's own subclass of cookie (but that's not needed anymore after the later rafactoring): 

http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/kv_engine/tests/mcbp/mcbp_test.cc#51

Line:7, utilities/CMakeLists.txt -> It is tempting to put it into its own library (mcd_tracing) ? as it allows it for easier unit testing? or?
