Line:460, daemon/cookie.h -> Did you consider handling this with shard_ptr or similar (so avoiding any manual ref-count tracking)?

Line:460, daemon/cookie.h -> I did not as I'm not going to change the entire callback scheme in and out of the engines at this point. By doing it this way I don't have to touch the engine interface at all and everything will just work as it used to (we'll keep the connection in the pending close state until all references to the object is released and at that time we initiate shutdown of the connection)

Line:460, daemon/cookie.h -> Yeah, but what we currently have isn't that great - see all the various hangs when trying to delete buckets.

Given we need to enhance the reference-tracking anyways for Cookie, I think this is a good opportunity to change to something which simplifies the management of Connections / Cookies.

I've not seen aside time in this project to solve that. Changing this may be done as a separate task later on
