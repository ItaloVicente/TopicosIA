Line:105, engines/ep/src/bgfetcher.cc -> You can delete this method now:

It's only called from doFetch (on the input param), which in turn is only called from BGFetcher::run where it's called on a local variable (items) - as such now you have owning pointers `items` will be cleaned up when it goes out of scope.

Line:283, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Could you raise a follow-up patch to make addLookupResult owning (i.e. EPEngine::lookups be an owning pointer).

(Once you're in the world of unique_ptr, calls release() should raise a flag...)
