DESCRIPTION:

MB-33959: Add replica tracking for ADM::State::secondChain

Add the tracking of replica acks for the secondChain in the ADM.
Modify SyncWrite::isSatisfied() to also require that the secondChain
meets the durability requirements.

Also, only commit SyncWrite if new active acks

If we are rebalancing an active vBucket to a new node, then we need
to ensure that SyncWrites are acked by the new active. This should be
done by checking that the secondChain active acks if we have a
secondChain (rebalancing) and the secondChain active differs to the
firstChain.

Currently a SyncWrite may time out if a replica from the second chain
acks before the change to a dual topology is propagated to us.

Line:270, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> Please document the return value - for example does it return the old or new value, and what about error?

Line:280, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> Please document this - and how it differs from the other overload.
