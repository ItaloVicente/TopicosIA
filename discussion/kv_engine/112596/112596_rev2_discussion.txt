DESCRIPTION:

MB-35252: Improve allowed duplicate prepare window generation

The alowedDuplicatePrepareSeqnos set is used to determine whether an
existing prepare found in the hashtable may be replaced by a new
prepare. This is only permitted after a disconnect/reconnect when the
commit for the existing prepare may have been deduplicated.

This set was previously initialised with all seqnos between the
highCompletedSeqno and the highSeqno of the VB. Prepares before the HCS
have been completed and should not be in the hashtable. Prepares after
the highSeqno have not yet been received, and do not need to be
considered.
The number of seqnos in the set when generated in this manner can be
very large; if no SyncWrites are seen, the lower bound of the window
(the highCompletedSeqno) would be zero. This leads to a very large set
being allocated, costing time and memory.

Solution: Instead, gather the seqnos of all SyncWrites currently in
trackedWrites. These are the only prepares we should ever see a
duplicate for (as a result of the current reconnection), and this set
is expected to be significantly smaller than the previous design, while
also being more precise; the old method contained a lot of seqnos that
did not even correspond to prepares.
