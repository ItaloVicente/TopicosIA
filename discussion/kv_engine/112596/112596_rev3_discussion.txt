DESCRIPTION:

MB-35252: Simplify allowed duplicate prepare logic

The alowedDuplicatePrepareSeqnos set is used to determine whether an
existing prepare found in the hashtable may be replaced by a new
prepare. This is only permitted after a disconnect/reconnect when the
commit for the existing prepare may have been deduplicated.

This set was previously initialised with all seqnos between the
highCompletedSeqno and the highSeqno of the VB. Prepares before the HCS
have been completed and should not be in the hashtable. Prepares after
the highSeqno have not yet been received, and do not need to be
considered.
The number of seqnos in the set when generated in this manner can be
very large; if no SyncWrites are seen, the lower bound of the window
(the highCompletedSeqno) would be zero. This leads to a very large set
being allocated, costing time and memory.

Solution: Instead, store the current highest trackedWrite seqno.
Any pending SyncWrite in the hashtable with a seqno lower than
this value *may* be replaced by another prepare, because the expected
Commit/Abort may have been deduplicated.

Do we need any additional tests here?
Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might also be worth elaborating how this works as the trackedWrites are "consumed" - i.e. (I believe) once committed/aborted they are not candidates to allow duplicates.

Line:25, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.h -> Can't see any usages of unordered_set in this file...

Line:3895, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Extra carriage-return?

Line:3900, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Seems like an unnecessary use of optional<> here - given you just set to zero if the optional was empty. 

Why not just have getHighestTrackedSeqno() return 0 if empty - given that's an invalid seqno anyway?
