Hi,

We were discussing with the power community on how many bits are being used for addressing on ppc64le and we found the below details :

Q. How many bits are being used for addressing on ppc64le? (How these 64 bits are divided ?)
- All 64 bits. You'll have to mask things off before doing any call.
- The kernel does not normally give you addresses in the whole 64-bit address space, so you *can* use some bits for tags, but the CPU will not ignore any bits.
- Also, be very wary here.  The number of bits ignored by the kernel is completely dependent on which release level of the kernel you're using. The useful address space has been expanding over the years, and you will find that at least some of those upper 16 bits are used to form useful addresses.
- This kind of thing is fraught with error potential, and you would likely be better off with a different implementation.

As per above discussion , looks like we need different implementation for Taggedptr on ppc64le. 
But for now , can we bypass the Taggedptr implementation in couchbase for ppc64le. If yes , then any functionality will affect ?  

Thanks,
Sandip

TaggedPtr is simply used as a space optimisation for metadata objects - primarily StoredValue, one of which exists in memory for every resident Document (often many millions or even billions of objects). As such saving even 2 bytes per StoredValue object can be significant over a large number of objects.

You could just implement TaggedPtr as a simple 8 byte ptr + 2 byte tag for ppc64le. Functionally that will work fine, you'll just have a higher metadata overhead when running on ppc64le compared to x86_64.
