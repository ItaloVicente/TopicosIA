DESCRIPTION:

MB-38109: Simplify logic for generating phosphor trace

This patch simplifies generation of a trace dump by
adding the logic to format the trace dump to the
"begin()" call which would block until the executor
had formatted the trace dump (in another thread).

Also remove the "chunked read" method to fetch the trace
dump to a single get call as the old chunk retrieval
required the server to keep state between each call to
the get (and that the trace dump could only be read
out _once_ by a single client. So if that client crashed
on the client side the entire trace would be lost).

By removal of all the complexity on the chunked reads
with multiple locks between various objects we got
rid of the code with caused the crash in the
referenced MB.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> The chunked read was added to minimise any latency impact to other connections assigned to the same worker thread. The serialised (textual) phosphor trace can easily be in excess of 100MB (for a 20MB binary default ringbuffer) and the trace is collected as part of cbcollect_info, which shouldn't have any production impact. 

As such I think we need to keep the chunking, or at least otherwise ensure that other connections on the same thread are fairly scheduled.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> It is formatted in a background thread in the executor, and then put into the frontend threads IO buffer. Other clients may "easily" do the exact same thing by do a pipelined get of 5 20MB items and they're up to 100MB in the send queue.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ah, it wasn't clear from the commit message that there was a new background task to do the extraction / formatting. 

I'll take a look in more detail.

Line:152, daemon/ioctl.cc -> I'll remove it now. The motivation for keeping it in there was to return the specific error message (but given that it is driven from the python script which now gets the entire one we don't need it)
