DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Successful RangeScan changes state to Completed

Initial motivator for this change was to improve the INFO logging
of a RangeScan, capturing when one is created and when it finally
goes away, with the desire to log the state.

Prior to this commit, all scans end up "Cancelled", so ~RangeScan could
only log that state.

An extra state (Completed) is added enabling the differentiation of
scans that were cancelled, enabling ~RangeScan to log the correct
state.

Some clean-up of the state transitions included as a lot of reviewing
of the state code occurred in this change. Resulting in removing the
needless switch from Continuing->Idle for a successful scan. Now that
case changes from Continuing->Completed.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Some logging considerations. Also, we seem to miss test coverage for the new behaviour ?
Line:54, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_continue_task.cc -> It seems worth to log this failure with some status detail.
Or maybe you're not doing that as we flow here also in benign/no-error cases and thus logging might become verbose?

Line:56, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_create_task.cc -> Here we rely on that KVStore logs the error.. I'm tempted to say "better we keep the warn here too" 😊

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> All existing tests sort of cover this new behaviour, we drive range scans to complete and cancelled in the existing code
Line:54, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_continue_task.cc -> Yes, this case covers normal vbucket state change and even user requested cancel, and later will include KV forced cancel - maybe I'll remove the comment, as it's not always a bad failure. From development, the really bad things get logged earlier, e.g. KVStore::scan errors are logged by the KVStore (couch or magma)

Line:56, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_create_task.cc -> But then we warn for a number of case the user can induce (empty range, bad sampling config), which is why I removed it and set the error context instead
