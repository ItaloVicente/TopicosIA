DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Successful RangeScan changes state to Completed

Initial motivator for this change was to improve the INFO logging
of a RangeScan, capturing when one is created and when it finally
goes away, with the desire to log the state and duration.

An extra state is added "Completed" that allows the differentiation
of scans that were cancelled, enabling ~RangeScan to log the
correct state and the runtime of the scan.

Some clean-up of the state transitions included as a lot of
reviewing of the state code occurs, primarily removing the
needless switch from Continuing->Idle for a successful scan.
Now that jumps straight from Continuing->Completed.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> moved this patch to the front of other changes due to a CV failure i'm unsure of. If the cv failure happens again (on windows only testapp), this logging maybe useful.
