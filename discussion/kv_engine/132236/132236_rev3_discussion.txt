I'm not currently convinced this patch has a good cost/benefit tradeoff. Monotonic is just a simple wrapper around an (interger) type, but forcing the operator T() to be explicit adds a huge amount of boilerplate and additional complexity / cost in the actual implementation of Monotonic.

Given std::atomic<T> allows implicit conversion to T, I don't see why we don't allow the same here.
Line:164, engines/ep/src/monotonic.h -> Note the choice to return T was deliberate, based on std::atomic. That is a more flexible usage - typically if you increment / decrement a type you want the "raw" value the object now is. I don't think this should be changed here.

Line:180, engines/ep/src/monotonic.h -> The scope of this patch is much larger than the commit message suggests. You should at least document them in the commit message.

Also - what do we need all these comparisons for? If it's because `operator T()` is now explicit, I think that's a poor design choice - consider what std::atomic does. The amount of boilerplate which is created for essentially no good reason isn't worth the complexity.

(i.e. I don't think we should slavishly follow Google's "explicit"

Line:236, engines/ep/src/monotonic.h -> By adding this stream operator you significantly increase the cost of using this header as you've pulled in a bunch of fmtlib stuff. 

Please remove this.
