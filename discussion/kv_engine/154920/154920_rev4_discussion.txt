DESCRIPTION:

MB-38077: Reduce size of evp_store_single_threaded_tests.cc

This commit moves a number of test suites to their own compilation
units to reduce the size of evp_store_single_threaded_tests.cc.

This will help unity building as batches may not becomes so large
and risk an OOM kill or other low-memory issue.

Secondly this should help future maintenance by keeping tests better
organised on disk.

This commit is a copy of code and clang-format change.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'm seeing 725 lines show up as not moved /copied (i.e. new) here; which is a reasonable number in terms of obfuscating the original author: 

 git show --stat 4bfd9748d|grep \| | cut -f 2 -d ' ' | xargs -n1 git blame -M -C | grep 4bfd9748d

I think it would be better to skip clang-format here, or at the very least do as a follow-up patch.
