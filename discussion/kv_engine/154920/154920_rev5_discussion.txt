DESCRIPTION:

MB-38077: 1/4 Reduce size of evp_store_single_threaded_tests.cc

This commit moves SingleThreadedEPBucketTest tests to their own
compilation units to reduce the size of
evp_store_single_threaded_tests.cc.

This will help unity building as batches may not becomes so large
and risk an OOM kill or other low-memory issue.

Secondly this should help future maintenance by keeping tests better
organised on disk.

This commit is a move of code only (clang format not applied)

Split into 4 patches. First 3 add a new file and move some code then patch 4 is clang-format.

expect to see clang-format fail for the new file?

Indeed. It's obviously a trade-off; but I think for large-scale moves like this accurate history is more valuable than perfect formatting.
