DESCRIPTION:

MB-38007: Reduce size of evp_store_single_threaded_tests.cc

This commit moves a number of test suites to their own compilation
units to reduce the size of evp_store_single_threaded_tests.cc.

This will help unity building as batches may not becomes so large
and risk an OOM kill or other low-memory issue.

Secondly this should help future maintenance by keeping tests better
organised on disk.

This commit is a copy of code and clang-format change.
