DESCRIPTION:

MB-44452: Use C++11 thread_local for ObjectRegistry currEngine

ObjectRegistry current engine thread-local is implemented using our
own 'ThreadLocal' class, which uses __pthread_{get/set}specific
internally on Linux/macOS.

Since moving to using the initial-exec TLS model (see 735bcd30a
"MB-23086: Enable TLS initial-exec "), the pthread... functions are
noticably slower than ther compiler-generated 'thread_local'.

Switch the current engine thread local to C++ native 'thread_local'
keyboard.

Before:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Benchmark                                           Time             CPU   Iterations
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    HashTableBench/Clear/iterations:100_median   18311278 ns     18310383 ns            5

After:

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Benchmark                                           Time             CPU   Iterations
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    HashTableBench/Clear/iterations:100_median   17612557 ns     17611689 ns            5

i.e. 3.8% speedup in HashTable::clear() runtime (median of 5 runs).
