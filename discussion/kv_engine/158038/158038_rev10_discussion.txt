DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Make CM::extractClosedUnrefCheckpoints O(1)

That is one of the major O(N = checkpoint-list-size) operations that we
do under CM::lock. Which can become very expensive if we allow a high
number of checkpoints in the list, thus impacting frontend operations.

The related benchmark results show that before this change the runtimes
of the function progressed linearly with the workload, while now they
stay constant at any workload:

$ ./ep_engine_benchmarks --benchmark_filter="ExtractClosedUnrefCheckpoints" --benchmark_repetitions=10
Run on (24 X 2400 MHz CPU s)
