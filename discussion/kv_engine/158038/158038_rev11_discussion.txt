DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Make CM::extractClosedUnrefCheckpoints O(1)

That is one of the major O(N = checkpoint-list-size) operations that we
do under CM::lock. Which can become very expensive if we allow a high
number of checkpoints in the list, thus impacting frontend operations.

The related benchmark results show that before this change the runtimes
of the function progressed linearly with the workload, while now they
stay constant at any workload:

$ ./ep_engine_benchmarks --benchmark_filter="ExtractClosedUnrefCheckpoints" --benchmark_repetitions=10

Patch Set 11: Verified+1

So the only failure in CV is at http://cv.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/kv_engine.threadsanitizer/job/master/13455/console where TSAN has spotted a legit data-race in CM.
The data-race is not introduced in this patch, so I'll set CV+1.
Why does TSAN sees that data-race only now? Not sure, but probably that's related to changing the CheckpointList's underlying type.
Fix for the data-race tracked in MB-47932.

Line:541, engines/ep/benchmarks/vbucket_bench.cc -> I think 100,000 checkpoints is a pretty large number - even if they were say small and had just 10 items in them, that's still 1M items queued in that vBucket!

Suggest we move the range down a bit - test 1 and 10 checkpoints (I expect that's closer to the common case) and maybe stop at 10k?

Line:541, engines/ep/benchmarks/vbucket_bench.cc -> Sure can show at any size, but:

On the low end, 1 and 10 don't show any big difference with 100 even before the optimization. That's why I've picked 100 as a starting point here.

On the high end, in the past we reached sizes in the order of 50k-60k, and that was when we tried to "close checkpoint at every snap-end mutation at PassiveStream" 😄 .. That's where a huge frontend degradation came up, that's why the 100k here. Who knows, maybe we are re-doing that at some point when all O(N) code in CM is gone :shrugh:

Sure, but that's important information for an observer - at the moment _I_ don't know what the behaviour of 1 / 10 is, for all I know 1 checkpoint could be 2x slower with the O(1) code (say constant factors are larger and they dominate) which would potentially be an issue.

Sure, but that's ultimately a result of allowing arbitrarily large flush batches in the first place (which we know we need to look at constraining in size and potentially at checkpoint boundaries.

My point is more that across a whole bucket it seems much too high to allow a (memory) checkpoint on active to grow to 100K items, as that implies there's 100M mutations in flight (at a minimum) across the entire cluster.

I'm less concerned about you keeping an 100K variant for the sake of seeing how things scale, but we really shouldn't be growing checkpoints anywhere near that size IMHO.

Recall the only reason checkpoints arn't say 1 item (slight exaggeration, but still...) is to allow de-duplication in CheckpointManager. I don't think there's value in allowing de-duplication across say 100k items, there's definitely value over say 10, the question is where is the cutoff point?...
