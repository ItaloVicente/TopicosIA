DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Don't scan the CheckpointList under lock at checkpoint-removal

That is one of the major O(N = checkpoint-list-size) operations that we
do under CM::lock. Which can become very expensive if we allow a high
number of checkpoints in the list, thus impacting frontend operations.
