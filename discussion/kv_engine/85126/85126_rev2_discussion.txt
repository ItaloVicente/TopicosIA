DESCRIPTION:

MB-26681: RocksDB: Add config params for num background threads

Add support for specifying the number of RocksDB background threads
indepentantly of the number of flusher / compaction tasks.

Flusher and Compaction tasks in RocksDB are per database (i.e
vBucket), not global - however we initially thought they were. As
such, the existing code to control the number of flushers/compactors
always sets the number of background threads to the same as the number
of tasks which run on those threads.

That would be fine if we had a single RocksDB database - we would have:

  - F flusher tasks running on F high priority threads, and
  - C compaction tasks runnning on C high priority threads.

However, given we have one DB per vBucket, this means we end up with:

  - F * V flusher tasks running on F threads, and
  - C * V compaction tasks running on C threads.

  Where V is the number of vBuckets.

As a result we cannot configure optimally in either direction - we
either end up with too many tasks scheduled across too many threads,
or too few tasks scheduled over too few threads.

This patch addresses this by making the (per-environment) thread
counts and the (per-DB) flusher and compaction tasks indpendent. It
adds two new config params:

* rocksdb_low_pri_background_threads
* rocksdb_high_pri_background_threads

In both instances a value of zero will auto-configure based on the
running system, or a non-zero value will override the default.

Patch Set 2:

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Just a typo

Line:32, /COMMIT_MSG -> Probably here it would be that we always end up with too many tasks scheduled across too few threads:
1) case where F and C are equal 1 (it is the minimum): the global thread pool is size 2, the total number of tasks is 2*V
2) case where F and C are greater than 1: the global thread pool is size F+C, the total number of tasks is (F+C)*V
Am I wrong?

Line:53, engines/ep/src/kvstore_config.cc -> Not sure if we really need this, sets are just copying the value. Maybe just move up in the initialization list?

Line:32, /COMMIT_MSG -> Well, in case (1) we have too few tasks - 1 Flusher running on 1 high pri thread, 1 Compactor running on 1 low pri thread.

In case (2) we have too many tasks if we want to maximise thread count - num_CPU low & high pri threads; with num_CPU * num_VB Flusher & compactor tasks.

Line:53, engines/ep/src/kvstore_config.cc -> We can't add them to the initialiser list as this is using a delating constructor; however I've removed the setXXX() mutators as they don't add much.
