DESCRIPTION:

[SR]: Use DiskDocKey for compaction hooks

Use DiskDocKey for compaction-related callbacks for (a) deleting
expired items and (b) dropping keys which are from deleted
collections.

TTLs are not applied to prepared SyncWrites, so the work here is
mostly to re-wire for the new type.

Collection deletion /does/ however affect prepared SyncWrites, as when
a collection is dropped we must remove all items (including prepared)
which exist for it.
