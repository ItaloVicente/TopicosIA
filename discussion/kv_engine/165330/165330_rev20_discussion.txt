DESCRIPTION:

Add mcbasher

Add back a new mcbasher (built on folly this time) which generate
load to a memcached node

Usage:
    mcbasher --host localhost \
             --user myuser \
             --password mypassword \
             --bucket mybucket \
             --connections 100 \
             --threads 4
             --pipeline \
             --ooo

Creates 4 threads with 100 connections using OoO and pipelines
data to hammer the server.

Instead of --pipeline and --ooo one may use --disconnect which
insert disconnects into the mix of operations to send to the
server.

Line:123, programs/mcbasher/mcbasher.cc -> Seems like this could be an error case (assuming disconnect isn't false) - should we log something here?

Line:153, programs/mcbasher/mcbasher.cc -> Perhaps also include some context on where this occurred form (i.e. during read)

Line:253, programs/mcbasher/mcbasher.cc -> Worth an else() which errors for unhandled `op` values?

Line:280, programs/mcbasher/mcbasher.cc -> Worth making this '100000' an argument to mcbasher?

Line:289, programs/mcbasher/mcbasher.cc -> Similar - or at least pull into a named constant.

I wasn't planning to do more on the program for now. I can always leave the patch in gerrit and change it the next time I'll do stuff with it.
Line:123, programs/mcbasher/mcbasher.cc -> It could be extended to let this be an error case.. right now it is part of a normal operation as I randomly inject quit messages which would cause the server to close the connection etc.

Line:153, programs/mcbasher/mcbasher.cc -> The only time I saw this was when I had a bug in the program which made the input stream parsing get out of sync and the exception message contained enough information (that the received packet was invalid)

Line:253, programs/mcbasher/mcbasher.cc -> we could ... but if an illegal operation would be added we would end up with an "invalid" packet (which gets detected on the server and an error message would be returned)... given that we just want to drive load to the server we could always send some invalid packets as well to verify that path in the server...

Line:280, programs/mcbasher/mcbasher.cc -> probably.. someone who need a bigger keyspace could add that :)

Line:289, programs/mcbasher/mcbasher.cc -> It was added because folly works differently than bufferevents in the way that it actually sends the data when you try to add an iobuf... so I didn't want to get _too_ many pending operations out there (given that each packet is so small we could end up with thousands until the buffer was filled as the server will processes these while we keep adding more)
