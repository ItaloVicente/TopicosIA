DESCRIPTION:

MB-36372: 4/4 Include resolvedQueue in getCookiesForInFlightSyncWrites

The final fix for this issue is to ensure that all SyncWrites get
notifyIOComplete during the VB state change away from active. This means
all items in trackedWrites and all items in the resolvedQueue (that have
a cookie).
