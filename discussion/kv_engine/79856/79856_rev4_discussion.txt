DESCRIPTION:

MB-23649: Force Noop for DCP streams using new features

Going forward we want to force noop for clients using dcp so as to
identify dead connections correctly. Because forcing it on all clients
would break many, we are starting off by forcing this on clients using
advanced/newer features like XAttrs/Collections. This mandatory setting
is controlled by the dcp_noop_mandatory flag.

Line:253, engines/ep/configuration.json -> As per the original MB, I think we need to either rename this setting, or change the type from bool to string, because "noop_mandatory"  isn't accurate; it's only mandator for specific features.

I suggest something like:

 dcp_features_requiring_noop : { "none", "spock" }

(and at a later date we add "spock.next" or whatever it's finally called).

Line:255, engines/ep/configuration.json -> ... if they request Spock or never DCP features: XATTRs, Collections.

Line:362, engines/ep/docs/stats.org -> Spock and later

Line:239, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> spock - "new" will be pretty meaningless in 1 years's time :)

Line:245, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Include the connection name and vbucket ID in the message (see the similar log messages below).

Line:145, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> This is a nice change (moving h & h1 to member variables), but it adds a lot of essentially unrelated changes to the actual feature fix, making it harder to see / review the actual functional changes here. Consider splitting such refactoring changes into one or more separate patches - e.g. a "cleanup TestDcpConsumer" patch before the main DCP noop patch.

Line:189, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Please document this argument.

Line:253, engines/ep/configuration.json -> you seem to use "spock" as a feature . Which I don't understand. If we use something like "spock" , it is difficult to do greater than comparison on the next release. If we add release names here, then for every further release, we need to update the config. I'm also not familiar with getting a release name inside the code to validate against.

dcp_features_requiring_noop : { "xattrs", "collections" } seems to make more sense. Let me know ..

Line:255, engines/ep/configuration.json -> will change

Line:245, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Done

Line:189, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite_dcp.cc -> Done

Line:361, engines/ep/docs/stats.org -> nit: True, NOOP

Line:243, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Shouldn't this be WARNING ?

Line:253, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I agree conceptually `dcp_features_requiring_noop : { "xattrs", "collections" }` makes more sense, but we don't support mathematical sets in the config. Instead you'd have to do something like:

 dcp_features_requiring_noop: {
     "none",
     "xattr+collections", 
     "xattr+collections+<insert_spock.next_features_here">", 
     "xattr+collections+spock.next+spock.next.next"}

As you can see, this would get pretty long-winded, hence me suggesting the shorthand of "spock" for the set of features which we added in that release.

In reality, this only needs to be a boolean (it's just a chicken-bit) - from this point forward any new DCP features we'll make noops mandatory on. The most accurate name I can think of (but it pretty long!) is:

 dcp_noops_manditory_for_spock_and_later_additions: {true, false}.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:253, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Can we settle on the setting name quickly?. I dont understand why we need to add release name to a setting name!!. definitely `dcp_noops_manditory_for_spock_and_later_additions` is long. I assume setting names are user facing & should be simple.

xattr+collections --? Should both be requested for the setting to be enforced? I was under the assumption that it would be any of the advanced feature that would trigger the mandatory noop. 

And What exactly do you mean by spock? you seem to use it in tandem with features like xattr/collections.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:253, engines/ep/configuration.json -> They aren't /that/ user-facing (only if the user wants to override settings via `cbecptl`, but they are used to auto-generate the Configuration class - in this case it auto-generates the method getDcpNoopMandatory().

By `Spock` I mean "the set of DCP features which first appeared in the Spock release". 

Just name it `dcp_noop_mandatory_for_v5_features: {true, false}` - that'll do for now, we can always rename it later
