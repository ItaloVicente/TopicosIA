DESCRIPTION:

Allow breakpad test to run without installing

The breakpad test did not provide a root directory in the
configuration for memcached, so it would use the "compiled in"
value which is set to the install directory to look for
the error maps.

By providing a path to the source directory we may pick up
the error maps from the source directory instead.
