DESCRIPTION:

MB-40517: ExecutorPool::cancel must be able to call schedule

The task cancel path can call schedule, this certainly happens for tasks
which have the final reference to a VBucket. The task destructs and
in-turn destructs the VBucket, which wants to schedule a clean-up task.
Prior to this fix, a deadlock occurred because schedule was called
whilst the ExecutorPool mutex was held (because we were inside cancel).

This fixes a regression introduced by 4d160d19.
