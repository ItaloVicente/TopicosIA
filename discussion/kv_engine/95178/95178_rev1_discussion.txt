DESCRIPTION:

Merge couchbase/spock into couchbase/vulcan

Mostly an empty commit as the majority of the changes are
backports so no code changes.

MB-29585 is a change new to spock but not in vulcan (test code
only).

* couchbase/spock:
  MB-25822: Create separate mutex for pending_io
  MB-29585: Test that backfilling is not affected by a checkpoint task
  [BP] MB-29585: Obtain the streamMutex earlier in the snapshot task
  MB-29662: DCP Consumer sets correct noop-interval on pre-5.0.0 Producer
  MB-29661: Update cmd_set for failing append/prepend ops
  [BP] MB-29531: Replace revSeqno with a 48-bit counter
