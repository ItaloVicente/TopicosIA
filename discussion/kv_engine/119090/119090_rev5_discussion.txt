DESCRIPTION:

MB-23086: Remove ep-engine memory tracking

Memory tracking is now part of the platform je_malloc abstraction so
code in EPStats is no longer needed.

Gone too are the allocation hooks, only test code now makes use of
hooking cb_malloc.

Change-Id: I9fcacd805b4c9e5c08d8e1944b51b08c6ead71ba
