DESCRIPTION:

MB-38762: Add error context for unknown collection/scope stream request

Minor re-factoring of the construction code so that we can grab
the manifest-id used in building the VB::Filter and then generate
the correct error context if we fail.

Change-Id: I2e59c7a66e26d1e8442d914f0f2f90ddf6fbc35f
