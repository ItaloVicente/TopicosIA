DESCRIPTION:

MB-46628: Consumer must be able to call CommitSyncWrite::getMessageSize

An update to commit/abort handling added an exception to both
CommitSyncWriteConsumer and AbortSyncWriteConsumer, this was
incorrect and meant that when DCP messages are buffered, we
hit the exception.

This commit tweaks the CommitSyncWrite hierarchy and allows
getMessageSize to be called for both producer/consumer.

Test cases added in this commit noted that DcpPrepare has
an incorrect buffer size, now tracked as MB-46634. This
commit adds very basic documentation for dcp prepare to
make this issue more evident.
