DESCRIPTION:

MB-49526: Update MagmaCompactionCB to set it's magma::Status

Update MagmaCompactionCB so that it sets it's magma::Status code if it
encounters a failure, so that we can cancel the compaction. As it might
not be possible to continue with it if for instance the in memory
vbucket has been destroyed.

To enable this change update we've also modified compactionCallBack()
and compactionCore() of MagmaKVStore to return a pair of a magma::Status
and a bool if to drop the doc.
