DESCRIPTION:

EPETest::TearDown() Add retries for database cleanup

We've seen sporadic CV failures on windows like:
    "cb::io::rmrf: remove of directory <directory>b\test.752202 failed:
    unknown error" thrown in TearDown()

I'm guessing that this is caused because someone is holding the
file open on Windows and there is a race during the shutdown
logic. Try to retry the operation 100 times by backing off
for a short period and eventually give up
