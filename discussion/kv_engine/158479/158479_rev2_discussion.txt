DESCRIPTION:

MB-47197: Add support for MutablePasswordDatabase

The password database usage in the server is immutable. A
database is loaded of disk in one thread, and then atomically
replaced with the old version.

When running unit tests we want to be able to change the
users entries, and its easier to operate on the objects
rather than parse the json and search within that.
