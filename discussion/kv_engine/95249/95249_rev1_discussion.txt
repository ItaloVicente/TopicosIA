In addition to the comments below, it's too late to make this kind of non-bugfix change in vulcan. Please move to master.
Line:382, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> I personally think renaming this is unnecessarily verbose / specific - most of the time you're interested in normal (non-meta) items, and keeping the name of the function as `getNumItems` is a suitable length (not too verbose, not too long).

Having `getNumItems` and `getNumMetaItems` to me makes it clear the difference between the two.

Line:801, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Ditto

Line:5328, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Be wary of renaming stats - they are in the public interface; and other components (e.g. ns_server) may depend on them existing. This is why we have a couple of places where the same underlying stat is output under 2 different names.

If you want to rename this, I'd defer it to master branch (where if there is any other comments which rely on it we have time to detect / fixup).

Furthermore, even if you /do/ rename this, I'd go with something "checkpoint_open_items" - for a a couple of reasons:

1. As per previous comments, the "non-meta" is redundant / too much information for the public API (users don't know / care about meta items).
2. putting "checkpoint" at the start means it'll alphabetically sort next to other stats related to checkpoints.
