DESCRIPTION:

add cluster test framework WIP

The cluster test framework allows you to create a cluster of 'n' nodes on the
same machine to test cross-node functionality (replication, durability etc).

    auto cluster = cb::test::createCluster(4);
    auto bucket = cluster->createBucket("test", {{"replicas", 3},
                                                 {"vbuckets", 1024},
                                                 {"max_size", 67108864}});

At this point you've got a cluster with a bucket named test and all of
the replication streams should be up'n'running. The cluster provides
a way to get a connection to a given node, or to get a connection to
the node where a given vbucket lives (with the specified state).
Note that you would need to authenticate and select bucket (the system
can't select the bucket for you as that would need to happen after
an authentication phase):

    auto connection = cluster->getConnection(bucket, Vbid{0});
    connection->authenticate("foo", "bar", "PLAIN");
    connection->selectBucket("test");
    conn->store("foo", Vbid(0), "value");

The test program does not work on windows yet due to:

1. process startup and teardown (I didn't bother implement it as I don't
   have the setup to test it right now. I'll spin up a VM later to fix it)
2. Program path's (I've not santized them)

In addition the following needs to be fixed:

* Directory structure
* DCP streams between the nodes
* The DcpReplicatorThread should be a _single_ thread for _all_ nodes
  where I use bufferevents (perhaps switch to folly at some point?)
