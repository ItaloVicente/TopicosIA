DESCRIPTION:

Add cluster test framework

The cluster test framework allows you to create a cluster of 'n' nodes
on the same machine to test cross-node functionality (replication,
durability etc).

    auto cluster = cb::test::createCluster(4);
    auto bucket = cluster->createBucket("test",
                                        {{"replicas", 3},
                                         {"vbuckets", 1024},
                                         {"max_size", 67108864}});

At this point you've got a cluster with a bucket named test and all of
the replication streams should be up'n'running. The cluster provides
a way to get a connection to a given node, or to get a connection to
the node where a given vbucket lives (with the specified state).
Note that you would need to authenticate and select bucket (the system
can't select the bucket for you as that would need to happen after
an authentication phase):

    auto connection = bucket->getConnection(Vbid{0});
    connection->authenticate("foo", "bar", "PLAIN");
    connection->selectBucket("test");
    conn->store("foo", Vbid(0), "value");

The test program does not work on windows yet due to:

1. process startup and teardown (I didn't bother implement it as I
   don't have the setup to test it right now. I'll spin up a VM
   later to fix it)
2. Program path's (I've not sanitized them)

(14 comments)

Overall functionality looks good - thanks for putting this together.

Comments are mostly minor details:
Line:10, tests/testapp_cluster/CMakeLists.txt -> Nit: long line (and given this is a new file, nicer to list the libraries one per line like the source files (minimises diff impact when adding / removing later).

Line:19, tests/testapp_cluster/bucket.h -> Given you only have a unique_ptr to DcpReplicator you should be able to fwd-declare it and avoid #including this in the header.

Line:33, tests/testapp_cluster/bucket.h -> Please add a brief description of this class.

Line:79, tests/testapp_cluster/bucket.h -> Could you (briefly) document what errors / this may throw?

File Comment: tests/testapp_cluster/cbsaslpw.json -> Can we just use the same test cbsasl file as used by testapp (to avoid duplication?)
Line:110, tests/testapp_cluster/cluster.cc -> Style: It might be more scalable as we add more parameters to implement the config handling by aggregating[1] the caller-specified `attributes` with the default values here, then instantiating vbuckets, replicas etc from the resulting merged config.

[1]: See json::update(): https://nlohmann.github.io/json/classnlohmann_1_1basic__json_a1cfa9ae5e7c2434cab4cfe69bffffe11.html#a1cfa9ae5e7c2434cab4cfe69bffffe11

Line:19, tests/testapp_cluster/clustertest.h -> Similar to previous comment, using Cluster via unique_ptr so can forward-declare.

Line:25, tests/testapp_cluster/dcp_replicator.cc -> Doesn't look like these are used here (yet?)

Line:91, tests/testapp_cluster/dcp_replicator.cc -> Would be nicer if we used a cond_var here - or you might be able to use ThreadGate - to avoid the hardcoded sleep time.

Line:27, tests/testapp_cluster/dcp_replicator.h -> Could you please briefly document this class?

Line:19, tests/testapp_cluster/dcppipe.h -> As previous, can you forward-declare `bufferevent` here?

Line:19, tests/testapp_cluster/node.h -> This header looks unused here.

Line:23, tests/testapp_cluster/node.h -> Forward-declare?

File Comment: tests/testapp_cluster/rbac.json -> Similar to previous comment, can we just re-use the existing testapp one?
