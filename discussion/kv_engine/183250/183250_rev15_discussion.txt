DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: Modify a replica collection over DCP (in-memory only)

Commit enables DCP to produce a collection modify system event
over DCP - for in-memory streaming only. With this commit a
history change made to the active collection will generate an
event which DCP will transmit to clients that have opted-into
flatbuffers_system_events

Support for flushing the event (and backfill testing) comes in
a later change.
