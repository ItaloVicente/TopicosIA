DESCRIPTION:

MB-27457: [1/n] Stub out a new dcp_deletion engine callback

To allow engines to transmit the delete-time of deletes over DCP a
new packet format will be introduced. This new packet format is made
available to clients that explicitly enable collections or delete-time
on their producers.

This commit adds a stubbed out 'v2' delete callback which shows the
data the new packet format will send.

Note: Later commits will migrate the collection length field from the
legacy delete into this new formatted one, so for now it's duplicated.
