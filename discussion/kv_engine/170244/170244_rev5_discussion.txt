DESCRIPTION:

MB-50543: Make PassiveStream's seqnos monotonic

Ensure that the our consumer streams throw if they receive a seqno that
isn't monotonic for current snapshot start and end seqnos, and also the
last received seqno. For cur_snapshot_start use the default throw policy
as this will mean we won't throw in production builds, as it we're sent
a non monotonic snapshot start seqno it's not the end of the world. But
for the snapshot end seqno and last_seqno, could cause nasty data
inconsistency issues.

This patch also fixes up test so they correctly drive passive streams by
not causing these values to be not monotonic.
