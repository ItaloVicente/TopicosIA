DESCRIPTION:

MB-36637: Avoid double-lock to vbstate at KVBucket:setVBucketState

With MB-36372 we always acquire an exclusive lock to vbstate at
vbstate-change. But, under certain conditions we may end up with
executing ActiveStream::setDead, which may lock to vbstate again.

To avoid the deadlock, with this patch KVBucket::setVBucketState
ends up calling an overloaded version of ActiveStream::setDead
that expects a lock to vbstate in input and avoid double-locking.

Line:1203, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Given this always returns zero you could change it to void.

Line:26, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.h -> Do you need this? You're only using a reference in boost::optional, so a forward-declaration should be sufficient...

Line:1653, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> It feels a bit odd that one of these methods takes a ReadHolder, and the other a Write holder.

If we only need a shared lock, then suggest you just downgrade the WriteHolder to a ReadHolder - see the following ctor in SharedMutex.h:

 explicit ReadHolder(WriteHolder&& writer);

Line:1203, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Doing

Line:1653, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> The only reason for the 2 versions to exist is to avoid the downgrade.
Currently in KVBucket::setVBucketState we acquire the exclusive lock to vbstate and hold it for the entire execution of vbstate-change. By downgrading to ReadHolder, we essentially allow front-end ops (and possibly other things? need to check) while setVBucketState_UNLOCKED is still executing.
We need to very that part of the current setVBucketState_UNLOCKED can be safely executed under ReadHolder, so I thought to defer that kind of change. But maybe we want to verify and touch that thing within this patch?
