DESCRIPTION:

MB-36637: Avoid double-lock to vbstate at KVBucket:setVBucketState

With MB-36372 we always acquire an exclusive lock to vbstate at
vbstate-change. But, under certain conditions we may end up with
executing ActiveStream::setDead, which may lock to vbstate again.

To avoid the deadlock, with this patch KVBucket::setVBucketState
ends up calling an overloaded version of ActiveStream::setDead
that expects a lock to vbstate in input and avoid double-locking.

Note: the test in this patch is disabled as blocked by the TSAN issue
at MB-36557 (which is itself blocked by this issue). The test will be
enabled in the fix for MB-36557.

think we need an (enabled) test for this
Line:2135, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> why not just add this in the next patch if it's disabled?

Line:2135, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> The test logically belongs to this patch.

This is the problem with enabling it here:

In this patch (which is the fix for the double-lock) TSAN spots the lock inversion issue (solved at http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/117017/). 
But, the latter must be on top of this patch because the double-lock in setVBState prevents TSAN from spot the lock-inversion.

Note that the test here is just doing a setVBState, but the cleanup call to destroy_mock_cookie() at the end of the test ends up in DcpConnMap::disconnect (which is the 2nd actor in the lock-inversion).
Also, cannot remove the call to destroy_mock_cookie() from this test as ASAN spots the memory-leak otherwise.

Line:2135, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Right, I understand. Could you just explicitly remove the connection (removeConn) before destroying the cookie in this thread to enable the test? Then remove that line in the next patch

Line:2138, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> you shouldn't have to recreate the connMap (it should already be a mock one)

Line:2135, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> It should work by avoiding the call to DcpConnMap::disconnect. Let's see if any of the CV jobs complain, uploading the change.

Line:2138, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Yeah, recently changed. Done
