DESCRIPTION:

MB-36637: Avoid double-lock to vbstate at KVBucket:setVBucketState

With MB-36372 we always acquire an exclusive lock to vbstate at
vbstate-change. But, under certain conditions we may end up with
executing ActiveStream::setDead, which may lock to vbstate again.

To avoid the deadlock, with this patch KVBucket::setVBucketState
ends up calling an overloaded version of ActiveStream::setDead
that expects a lock to vbstate in input and avoid double-locking.

Note: the test in this patch is disabled as blocked by the TSAN issue
at MB-36557 (which is itself blocked by this issue). The test will be
enabled in the fix for MB-36557.

> Is it possible to simplify the locking here - i.e. don't have all these various optional lock cases, and just always acquire the vbStateLock at the top level ?

Yes. One option is to downgrade from WriteHolder to ReadHolder, which I haven't done here for the reason mentioned in my previous comment.
The other option is that we keep only VBucket::removeAcksFromADM(WriteHolder&) and we just pass down the WriteHolder from the top-level setVBState. But, that way at ActiveStream::setDead we would always acquire an exclusive-lock that blocks front-end ops. Not sure about the entity of perf-degradation in that case though (Stream::setDead is not a hot-path).
