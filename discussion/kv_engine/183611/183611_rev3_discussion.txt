DESCRIPTION:

DCP docs: Add 'design discussion' page

Add a new 'DCP Design Discussion' page, to cover additional details on
why DCP works in certain ways, and gives examples of how it can break
if certain rules are not followed.

The page initially has details on why snapshot start/end must be
passed correctly when resuming a stream.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Line:24, docs/dcp/documentation/discussion.md -> Historically this was certainly the case, and it might still be if we continue to use a Checkpoint that we have previously sent a snapshot for, but this happens much less often since this change - https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/168932.
Whilst this is possible, it is only possible if we've previously streamed 1:SET(B) from the active, and that contradicts the rest of the example.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:24, docs/dcp/documentation/discussion.md -> Nod. I'll remove the sentence - it's not important for the general gist of the issue.
