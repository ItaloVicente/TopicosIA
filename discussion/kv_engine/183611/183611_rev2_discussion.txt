DESCRIPTION:

DCP docs: Add 'design discussion' page

Add a new 'DCP Design Discussion' page, to cover additional details on
why DCP works in certain ways, and gives examples of how it can break
if certain rules are not followed.

The page initially has details on why snapshot start/end must be
passed correctly when resuming a stream.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I might have misunderstood your example, but I don't think it works in the way in which you described.
Line:47, docs/dcp/documentation/building-a-simple-client.md -> nit: replica (the word used earlier in the sentence) probably makes this easier to follow for those less familiar

Line:47, docs/dcp/documentation/building-a-simple-client.md -> nit: starts

Line:24, docs/dcp/documentation/discussion.md -> nit: 2, and so on below...

Line:28, docs/dcp/documentation/discussion.md -> I don't think that this is right. I think it branched before rather than after (at least in terms of seqnos), and I think that you would be told to rollback to 2.

What I think needs to happen here is something like:

1. Client gets vb UUID a
2. Client receives snapshot start=2, end=5
3. Client receives mutation at seqno 3
4. Active restarts but has only persisted up to seqno 3, new UUID created.
5. Client reconnects with start=seqno=end=3 and is not told to rollback, but it should have been as the snapshot it was in the middle of receiving is not consistent with the "new" active.

Line:24, docs/dcp/documentation/discussion.md -> Will fix - but note markdown will always number then sequential for you - you can write:

 1. 
 1.
 1.
 
And it'll render as 1), 2) 3)...

Line:28, docs/dcp/documentation/discussion.md -> The branch point is the last common seqno - consider the degenerate case where the initial UUID has a seqno of zero.

In terms of the scenario above - yes you're right - I left the snap_start=snap_end=start=4 (which was from a more complex example) when I simplified it. Will fix.

Line:47, docs/dcp/documentation/building-a-simple-client.md -> replica (to me) implies a Data Service replica, not necessarily another DCP client.

Line:47, docs/dcp/documentation/building-a-simple-client.md -> Ack

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:47, docs/dcp/documentation/building-a-simple-client.md -> Then perhaps we shouldn't say "This is because DCP is a master-replica protocol" because not all DCP consumers are replicas.

Line:47, docs/dcp/documentation/building-a-simple-client.md -> I was just trying to clean the old wording ;)


I think what it's getting at is that we don't do chain replication but star replication (all replicas replicate from the active node). 

Let me try to re-word...
