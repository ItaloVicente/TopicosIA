DESCRIPTION:

MB-24378: Use separate bit to check if stored value is resident

With a deleted item also containing a value, there is a case
where an item could be in deleted state in memory but not
contain a value. Hence to distinguish between cases where
value is resident in memory but NULL and with those not
resident in memory, introduce a new bit to check if value is
resident or not independent of value

Please also add some tests to stored_value_test for the new isResident state - for example:

* Check that isResident is the expected value when creating SVs from different Item types (temp vs non-temp).
* Check that evicting SVs updates isResident correctly.
* Check that deleting SVs (with null and non-null values) sets isResident correctly.
Line:622, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> I would have thought that calling markNotResident() would be sufficient here (or at least conceptually that's what we are doing). Maybe remove the call to resetValue() and modify markNotResident() to also remove the value (if one if present).

Line:52, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> This is potentially incorrect - note we call markNotResident at line 65 if the item is temp.

I think it's cleaner to set this once correctly - i.e. remove line 64..66 and change the initialiser list to:

 isResident(!isTempItem())

Line:302, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> I think this comment is incorrect now - can you remove please?

Line:311, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> As per previous comment, this isn't totally accurate; as we may change it below (line 330..332). Suggest you change so we only set isResident once.

Line:350, engines/ep/src/stored-value.cc -> isResident needs adding here.

Line:40, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Should probably expand this - add something like: 

 ... or if the item has no value (a deleted item with null-value).

Line:443, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> As per the previous comment, I think it would be clearer if this function also removed the value (i.e. fold resetValue into this). This ensures we enforce the invariant that:

 If an Item is not resident, then value is null.

Line:676, engines/ep/src/stored-value.h -> Style: Member variables should not start with underscore (I know _isDirty does but that's in the minority). See https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#name-types-functions-variables-and-enumerators-properly
