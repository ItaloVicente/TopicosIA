DESCRIPTION:

MB-29816: Properly handle return codes from couchstore within couch-kvstore

Whilst this is not the cause of the issue, investigation into the code
paths led to the discovery we are not always handling the return codes
from couchstore within the saveDocs method. As such, fix this so we
are protected from potential failures.

Change looks good, but needs tests to ensure this code is exercised.

Jim was looking at this, and he couldn't find a way to make those calls fail.

... well -  you were hypothesising that /if/ they did fail that could cause the problem ;)

Does that mean they cannot possibly fail; or that we cannot currently eject errors to make them fail?

The latter, the code for those methods within couchstore can return an error code, we just can't inject it
