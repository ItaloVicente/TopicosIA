DESCRIPTION:

Don't make any assumption on 'lastReadSeqno' in StreamTest::BackfillOnly

In StreamTest::BackfillOnly we currenlty do in order:
1) lock until ActiveStream::lastReadSeqno reaches a certain <value>
2) then, check that ActiveStream::backfillItems::disk == <value>

We have two issues:

a) the order of checks above is wrong as in
ActiveStream::backfillReceived we increment first 'lastReadSeqno' and then
'backfillItems.disk', so we may fail at step 2) above depending on threads
execution order

To fix, we check the value of ActiveStream::backfillItems::disk at step
1).

Note that we cannot make any assumption on 'lastReadSeqno' as point 2).
Even if we have stored 'numItems' (note that we auto-generate seqnos, so
if e.g. numItems=3 then we store seqno={1, 2, 3} as expected), the test
itself issues GAT operations in a separate thread. That may result in
the items seqno to change while the backfill has not completed yet.
