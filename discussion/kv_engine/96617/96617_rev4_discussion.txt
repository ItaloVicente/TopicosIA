DESCRIPTION:

Fix assertions order in StreamTest::BackfillOnly

In StreamTest::BackfillOnly we currenlty do in order:
1) lock until ActiveStream::lastReadSeqno reaches a certain <value>
2) then, check that ActiveStream::backfillItems::disk == <value>

The order of checks above is wrong as in ActiveStream::backfillReceived
we increment first 'lastReadSeqno' and then 'backfillItems.disk', so we
may fail at step 2) depending on threads execution order.

To fix, we check the value of ActiveStream::backfillItems::disk at step
1).
