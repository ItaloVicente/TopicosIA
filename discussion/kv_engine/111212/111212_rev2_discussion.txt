DESCRIPTION:

MB-34542: Allow overwrite of prepare when streaming from disk

We need to always allow the overwrite of a prepare with a mutation
when a replica/pending vBucket is streaming from disk. The active
node will send mutations instead of commits if the consumer node
has missed a prepare so the consumer must unconditionally accept
this mutation and overwrite (if it has one) it's existing prepare.
