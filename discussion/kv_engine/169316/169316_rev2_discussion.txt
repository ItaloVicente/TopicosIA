DESCRIPTION:

Add logging in EPE::initialize

We've seen cases where we've been "stuck" in bucket create,
and from looking at CBSE-11220 it looks like the calling
thread was "stuck" inside "EPE::initialize" for at least
3 1/2 minute (as that's the window we have logs for, and
it does not contain the logging of the configuration).

This patch times the execution of a "block" of code and
add a log message if the execution exceeds 50ms which
would give us an indication _where_ we're spending
the time.
