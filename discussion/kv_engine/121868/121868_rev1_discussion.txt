DESCRIPTION:

MB-37096: Debug CRT: Reduce ep_perfsuiter iterations by 20x

ep_perfsuite tests run quite slowly under Windows Debug
CRT, frequently hitting the test suite timeout (1500s) when run on CV
machines.

Given we only run this in Debug mode for functional testing, reduce the
iteration count by 20x compared to the normal number.

(Note: the code _did_ previously attempt to run at a reduced iteration
count for Debug builds, however it used an ifdef which is not set on
Windows. Change to use folly's Portability header which handles these
differences.

With this change, ep_perfsuite completes in ~200s on Windows Debug mode.
