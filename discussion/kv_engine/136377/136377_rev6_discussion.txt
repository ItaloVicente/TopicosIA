DESCRIPTION:

MB-39745: Add BgFetchers to EPBucket

Move the BgFetchers to EPBucket in preparation for decoupling them from
KVShards. The behaviour of BgFetchers in this patch should be identical
to their behaviour before.

Line:124, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.h -> Where is this called from (outside the ep bucket context?) Can this be made non-virtual and moved to EPVBucket, changing to return a reference?
