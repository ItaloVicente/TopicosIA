DESCRIPTION:

MB-32571:  Don't put system events in the hash-table

Persistent buckets have always skipped the hash-table when
creating system events, they have no use being stored there.

Rollback however is loading the system events and placing
them into the hash-table, this has tripped an exception
in new functions, however it is also a waste of resources.
