DESCRIPTION:

MB-25784: Move get/set cluster config to the core

This configuration used to be store within the actual
engine, but it should live in the core (that makes it
easier to implement push logic from the server to the
client when ns_server push a new config to the bucket).

Looks good. Couple of small suggestions.
Line:54, daemon/cluster_config.cc -> std::stol is generally preferred as the error handling is more explicit.

Line:52, daemon/cluster_config.h -> How often is this method called - on every connect? Might be better to instead return a shared_ptr - which doesn't require copying the whole object every time (and will correctly handle the case where the config is changed to a new one).

Line:54, daemon/cluster_config.cc -> I thought about that, but from the docs it require std::string. I just looked at the old code I nuked and ep-engine used to parse it.. So I guess I should be good to go to just replace it with subjson... after all it is only called every time someone tries to set a new cluster configuration so it is not _THAT_ performance sensitive..

Line:52, daemon/cluster_config.h -> This follows the same logic we used to have in ep-engine, it is just pushed into the core. 

The method is called during handling of "not my vbucket" which currently isn't part of the critical path / common path.
