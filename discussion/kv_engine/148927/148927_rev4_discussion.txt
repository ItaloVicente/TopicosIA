DESCRIPTION:

MB-44827: Don't lock the bucket for the common case

We don't need to lock the bucket during disconnect unless it
was the last connection to disconnect from the bucket. If it
was the last connection we should grab the mutex and reevalute
the expression and possibly notify the thread waiting for
disconnect.

Same goes for association of a bucket. We don't need to look
at a bucket if the atomic say that the state isn't ready. If
it is ready we should lock the bucket and compare the name
to avoid racing with bucket deletion.
