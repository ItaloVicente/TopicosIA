DESCRIPTION:

MB-43156: Update waketime in FollyExecutorPool::wake()

If a task managed by an ExecutorPool is scheduled to run immediately
via wake(), it's wakeTime - the time it was desired to run - should be
reset to "now" - given that's the new time for it to run. waketime is
then used to calculate the queue time of the task - how long the task
has been waiting to run, which is exposed via cbstats scheduler.

However the FollyExecutorPool implementation fails to update the
waketime when wake() is called; leaving at its previous value. This
can give inaccurate values for queue time, as the the queue time is
reported as zero (capped from a large negative value:

    now() - waketime.
