DESCRIPTION:

MB-54955: Fix segfault in tests using ServerBucketApi

The segmentation fault was caused by a use-after-free which happened
because EPEngineGroupTest used to replace the bucketApi pointer in the
static ServerApi instance with one pointing to an impl with lifetime
bound to that of the test suite.

Change the test to not modify the static ServerApi.
