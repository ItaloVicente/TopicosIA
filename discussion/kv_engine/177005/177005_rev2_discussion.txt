DESCRIPTION:

[serverless] Update test for UnmeteredPrivilege

All connections are metered unless they have the unmetered privilege
in its effective privilege set. Connect as the almighty "@admin" user
and verify that the connection is unmetered by default, but once the
privilege gets dropped it is metered.
