DESCRIPTION:

kv_slow_ops_2_gtrace: Parse and report 'Slow runtime' messages

Add support for parsing 'Slow runtime' messages from background
tasks. These are added to their own rows on the trace, positioned
before the Connection rows.

Note that we only have the system clock time of these events, so we
need to map those times to the higher-precision steady_clock as used
by trace spans. This is done by calculating the delta between system
clock and steady clock based on the 'Slow operation' log messages
which print both.

There is an error bar on the timestamps / duration of the 'Slow
runtime' events:

1) We don't stictly lookup now() on both clocks at the same instant.

2) The 'Slow runtime' messages only having millisecond precision for
   their durartion.

However I think there's still value in being able to plot these events
together.
