DESCRIPTION:

MB-34658: Don't allow aborts with prepareSeqno of 0

We should never receive an abort with a prepare seqno of 0 now that
we persist the prepare seqno on disk and store it in the
OrderedStoredValue. Remove the error checking added that allowed an
abort with prepare seqno of 0 when receiving an initial disk snapshot.
