DESCRIPTION:

MB-45378: Statically link all engines

Two issues[1,2] have so far been identified with Folly when multiple
instances of Folly end up within the same process - i.e. multiple
executables / DSOs present in memcached process.

Both issues can be fixed by changing the visibility of certain folly
symbols, but our current usage model (linking into shared libraries
with visibility=hidden) is not the common model for Folly and hence the
concern that this isn't a stable or safe way to continue to consume
Folly.

As such, move as much as possible of our linking to be static -
specifically any library which uses Folly should be linked statically.

This patch does this for all engines, so they are part of the
memcached binary.
