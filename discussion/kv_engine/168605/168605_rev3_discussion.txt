DESCRIPTION:

MB-49630: Legacy stream sends tombstones when no alive doc exists

In the case where the default collection contains only tombstones (ie,
no alive doc stored), then
DCPBackfillBySeqnoDisk::markLegacyDiskSnapshot misses to send the
tombstones and moves the stream directly to StreamEnd.
This fix ensures that tombstones are always sent.
