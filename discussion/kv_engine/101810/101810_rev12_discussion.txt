DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Remove checkpoint offset and ckptMetaItemsRead

Instead of keeping cached values of the number of items that have
already been read, (which are used to calculate the number of items that
are the cursor has left to consume - see getNumItemsForCursor), we
calculate dynamically.

This allows us to remove the offset and ckptMetaItemsRead parameters
from CheckpointCursor, which significantly simplifies the code.
