DESCRIPTION:

MB-39280: Flusher marks-clean item in the HashTable by Seqno

We used to check the CAS in place of Seqno in the PersistenceCallback,
which is wrong as we have legal scenarios where multiple mutations with
different Seqno and same CAS (for the same key) may be queued in the
system.

Eg, an XDCR setup where multiple source clusters replicate to the same
destination cluster.
In that case, we may end up with marking clean (by CAS) a StoredValue
that has never been persisted. That makes the SV eligible for eviction.
Which in turn may lead to exposing a stale item from disk.

See the unit test linked to this fix for a detailed reproduction of the
described scenario.

Line:5127, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> would a single threaded test not be simpler? store an item and read its (queues for flushing), Use the post flush hook to call setWithMeta using cas of first item?

Line:5127, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> You're right, it would be simpler.

But the purpose of this test is also to show the issue how it may really happen in a real scenario, that's why I start a second thread and run the flusher in there + I synchronize the 2 threads so that we reproduce the "unlucky" interleaving that I describe in the MB.

QE has asked what is a functional test for them to reproduce the issue. Unfortunately I had to answer that the issue is completely non-deterministic and I pointed them to this test that reproduces exactly what I described in the MB.

I'm happy to change the test if you prefer, but then I need to explain what I'm simulating when I call setWithMeta from the Flusher :)
