DESCRIPTION:

MB-30149: move dcp_message_producers::stream methods to virtual methods.

Move dcp_message_producers::stream_req() & add_stream_rsp() to virtual
methods.

This also required removing get_dcp_producers() and replacing with
constructing MockDcpMessageProducers objects directly. This is because
a few tests 'monkey patched' MockDcpMessageProducers' function
pointers; however this isn't possible with virtual methods. As such we
now construct instances of MockDcpMessageProducers (or other derived
classes) and override virtual methods where necessary.
