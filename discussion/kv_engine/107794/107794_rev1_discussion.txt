DESCRIPTION:

Add RocksDB variant of DurabiltyPersist tests

To assist in validating the behaviour of different storage backends
(and exactly what de-duplication is automatic (i.e. optional) and what
is explicitly needed by couchstore, add a RocksDB variant of the
DurabilityPersist tests.

This also moves the DurabilityPersist tests into their own file - note
there is no other changes to the tests other than moving to
DurabilityEPBucketTest test fixture.
