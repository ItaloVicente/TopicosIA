DESCRIPTION:

MB-38077: Fix unity build issues

Fix a variety of issues in our source / build system which are flagged
when enabling unity build - where multiple source files are compiled
together into a single translation unit.

Most of the issues are various flavous of breaking the one definition
rule (ODR) - there can only be a single definition of every
symbol. There is two variants of this:

1. The same source files is compiled twice, which when building as
   unity build end up in the same object / link phase. The general
   solution here is to only build each source file once, adjusting
   CMakeLists.txt to ensure the targets wich need a symbol pick it up
   from the single object file.

2. Two different source files define a (static) symbol with the same
   name. This is normally fine as static symbols only have visibility
   within the same translation unit, and normally only a single source
   file is compiled at once. However this breaks down in a unitu build
   those two source files are compiled together. The general solution
   is to avoid the conflict - either by renaming one or both symbols,
   or changing their scope.

There are also some issues related to namespacing - generally a `using
namespace` directive in a .cc file is a safe thing to do, however with
a unity build that can "pollute" other source files included in the
translation unit after the first. This can be avoided thier by
removing the `using namespace` or adding explicit namespacing
prefixing (e.g. ::to_string to refer to a symbol in the global
namespace).

has a good writup on getting unity builds working.

Any reason for not squashing it into this?

CV would have had to run for the separate patch anyway...

Those patches should be squashed as we don't have patches in the middle..
