DESCRIPTION:

MB-36256: Commit vbstate into compaction output file

In the MB we crashed because the vbstate prepare count was out
of sync with the couchstore file, allowing for us to calculate a
negative item count during warm-up.

The prepare count must be written to the new couchstore file so it is
consistent with the data.

This patch also identified that the cachedDocCount was incorrect if
used directly after warmup (the unit test identified this issue).

A final update is to the logging.

1) the MB showed that we don't log the changes to prepares during
 compaction
2) The completed log line is now quite large, this commit does a
 lightweight tidy up.
3) The constant unlink message is noisy and was only added to
 speculatively assist a previous MB (it didn't help).

Comparison of compaction completed change:

Previous:
Compaction of vb:0 completed (ok). tombstones_purged:764, collection_items_erased:alive:0,deleted:0, pre{size:16475, items:2, deleted_items:1, purge_seqno:0}, post{size:8283, items:0, deleted_items:1, purge_seqno:0}

Now:
Compaction of vb:0 done (ok). purged tombstones:0, prepares:0, collection_items_erased:alive:2,deleted:0, size/items/tombstones/purge_seqno pre{16475, 2, 1, 0}, post{8283, 0, 1, 0}
