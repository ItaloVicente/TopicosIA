DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Reset default max_checkpoints from 2 to 10

All the work in MB-47386 aimed to this change.
Full checkpoint removal is the most effective checkpoint memory
recovery strategy. Increasing the number of allowed checkpoints leads
to having much more checkpoints eligible for removal.
