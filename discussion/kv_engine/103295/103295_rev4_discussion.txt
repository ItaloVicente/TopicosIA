DESCRIPTION:

MB-32394 [SR]: Split 'Committed' state into ViaMutation & ViaPrepare

The StoredValue::committed member is used to distinguish between
Pending & Committed items; both to 'hide' Pending items from view when
not wanted, and also to allow the difference to be passed down to
CheckpointManager & DCP via Item.

However, to support the new DCP_COMMIT message we need to be able to
distinguish between queued_items which were committed as a result of a
Prepare operation, or ones which were 'committed' by a normal mutation
operation - the former should be encoded as DCP_COMMIT, the latter as
DCP_MUTATION.

Given that the queued_items are formed from StoredValue, we hence need
to distinquish StoredValues which were committed via the two
operations previously mentioned.

To achieve this, split Committed into two enum values:

- CommittedViaMutation - A Committed item, which resulted from a
  normal mutation operation.

- CommittedViaPrepare - A Committed item, which results from a
  prepared SyncWrite.

(The exising Pending value stays as-is).

Update the various uses of the enum; and update tests as appropriate.

Line:453, engines/ep/src/item.h -> Not sure that we really need this at this point.

In terms of usage I see that this function is called:
1) once in the StoredValue ctor for doing setCommitted(itm.getCommitted());
2) in many places always for checking if (getCommitted == Pending)

Maybe we could replace with (or leave it, but add) a

bool isPending() {
    return op == queue_op::pending_sync_write;
}


Also, there's no logic at all where we expect this to return CommitetdState::CommittedViaPrepare ?
I would expect at least 1 case: when moveing the replica cursor for sending the item to replica, to understand if it is a DCP_MUTATION or DCP_COMMIT.
Maybe we are not using this function for implementing that logic ?

Line:453, engines/ep/src/item.h -> In a future patch we will expand to needing the three different values for CommittedState. I could have deferred changing the return value until later, but given I was already needing to change this function because the enum values have changed I thought I'd take the opportunity to change the return value now also.

If you feel strongly I can defer the change in return value to a later patch.

Line:453, engines/ep/src/item.h -> Thanks for explaining. Fine to keep as it is as and expand in a follow-up patch.
