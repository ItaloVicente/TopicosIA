DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: VB::Manifest switch to F14NodeMap

Noticed during investigation of running KV with 'max' collections
was that the final mem_used didn't quite tally with expectations.
Further investigation showed that the F14FastMap resulted in more
overhead for each map than expected (and we have 1 map per vbucket).

mem_used values were recorded before and after this change as follows.

A = mem_used in default state (only default collection exists)
B = mem_used after deploying 1000 collections
C = B - A - The memory cost of deploying the collections

Deploying the 1000 collections meant that every vbucket of the node now
has a map with 1000 entries, in the test 1 node with 1024 vbuckets was
used.

F14FastMap (pre this change)
    A 35098584
    B 217727280
    C 182628696

F14NodeMap
    A 35034408
    B 198092408
    C 163058000

Performance was also checked using perf-tests which deploy and operate
against 1000 collections. No change was observed.

Further improvements in memory usage are expected in changes related to
MB-39292, from there we should be able to get some per-vbucket costs
and then use that in cluster sizing.
