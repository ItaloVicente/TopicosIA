DESCRIPTION:

MB-35717: Fix handling of SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE

If ssl_write returns SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE it has
computed the next segment, but there isn't enough
room in the underlying bio to "send" it so it
needs to be drained.

According to the man page for ssl_write it should
be called again with the same parameters (data and size).

Previously we tried to chunk up our writes to ssl_write
so that they would "fit" into the underlying buffer, but
there isn't much point of doing so (except for adding
extra complexity to an already too complex solution).
