DESCRIPTION:

MB-43237: Remove histogram batch_read (superseded by bg_load)

The batch_read histogram is effectively equivalent to bg_wait:

* batch_read measures the duration from when a background fetch
  started executing (beginning of BgFetcher::doFetch, to when all
  background fetches in the same batch completed (end of
  BgFetcher::doFetch).

* bg_load measures the duration from when a background fetch started
  executing, to when the item is inserted into the HashTable
  (EPVBucket::completeBGFetchForSingleItem and available for access).

The two measurements are very similar - they have the same start
point, but batch_read end point is slightly later, and arguably less
meaningful given it uses the same duration for all items fetched (even
if one has long been inserted in HashTable and client notified).

Therefore batch_read is essentially redundant - and was never
documented in stats.org.

As such, remove batch_read to simplify out stats measurement.
