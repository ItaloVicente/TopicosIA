DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: move error_maps to etc/couchbase/kv/error_maps

The file is couchbase and kv specific and should go in
a couchbase and kv specific directory. If one tries to install
couchbase with / as the prefix we shouldn't be cluttering /etc
with all of our files, but put them in /etc/couchbase.

Isolated the value isn't big, but it would be better if we would keep configuration files in a "standard" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard) location and kept together. Back in the days we wanted to be able to install in "root" if we got integrated with the os (have suff live in /usr /etc etc) and then keeping everything "relative" to our /opt/couchbase directory made that an easy change. If we want to drop all of that, we should do that "all over" and also get rid of the extra (empty) var/lib/couchbase directories located under /opt/couchbase (I would guess that _more_ people try to navigate in there in order to look at the logs, than people trying to navigate into /etc/couchbase/kv to tune some some of our configuration files...)
