DESCRIPTION:

MB-33296, MB-33172 [SR]: DM enforces durability-impossible

This patch fixes the definition of Majority in DurabilityMonitor:
  majority = chain_size / 2 + 1
always, even in the case where the chain contains Undefined nodes.

With this patch the DM checks if 'durability-impossible' every time a
new write is added for tracking.

Note that a proper error code is returned by the DM but not yet
processed by the caller (VBucket). That means, the clients will not
receive an error code yet. That is added in a dedicated patch.

Note that this patch implicitly fixes MB-33172. From now on, the
DurabilityMonitor returns durability-impossible if the user issues a
SyncWrite but the replication-chain is not set (rather than throwing an
expection).

Line:676, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> It's not very clear to me which tests are expected to return successfully, and which return DURABILITY_IMPOSSIBLE - given it's hidden within testDurabilityImpossible() and if expectedFirstChainSize < majority

Consider either making that more explicit in each test name (DurabilityPossible / DurabilityImpossible), or restructuring so testDurabilityImpossible() returns a result which is checked in the body - e.g.

 ...
 EXPECT_TRUE(testDurabilityPossible(...)); // positive tests
 ...
 EXPECT_FALSE(testDurabilityPossible(...)); // negative tests.

Line:679, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Style: Consider using SCOPED_TRACE() to make it easier to see which test we are in if/when testDurabilityImpossible() fails.

(https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/advanced.md#adding-traces-to-assertions)

Line:680, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Style: Do we need the explicit class name - can we not just use an initialiser list as per https://github.com/nlohmann/json#json-as-first-class-data-type :

 {{"topology", {"active"} }} 

?

(Similar comment later on...)

Similary, you always pass {"topology" : ...} to the helper function - can simplify to just pass the topology value and have the test function add the next-level dictionary.

Line:733, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Nit: Not really random, they are fixed in each test case - better to say "different" or "multiple" etc.

Line:769, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> You say this, but the same seqno is used as the previous call to testDurabilityImpossible?

Line:676, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Going with the second approach (EXPECT_TRUE/FALSE checked in the body).
Note that with either ways the name of the test itself will have a generic "DurabilityImpossible_" prefix, while the test may cover both possible/impossible scenarios (given that I've organized tests on "num-replicas").

Line:679, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Done

Line:680, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> > Style: Do we need..

Not really. We can use the initializer list if the arg is nlohmann::json::array_t.
Done.

Line:733, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Done

Line:769, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> I think that the enhancements you suggested make this more clear.

s:3 must be rejected at the previous step.
If it is accepted (for any reason, which is wrong), then the next step will also fail, given that queueing the same seqno twice triggers seqno-invariant error conditions (the tracked seqno in DurabilityMonitor is strictly monotonic).

The test would be perfectly valid if I use s:4 at this last step, but we would miss that double-coverage on seqno-invariant.
