DESCRIPTION:

MB-33296 [SR]: DM enforces dur-impossible if Majority cannot be satisfied

This patch fixes the definition of Majority in DurabilityMonitor:
  majority = chain_size / 2 + 1
always, even in the case where the chain contains Undefined nodes.

With this patch the DM checks if 'durability-impossible' every time a
new write is added for tracking.

Note that a proper error code is returned by the DM but not yet
processed by the caller (VBucket). That means, the clients will not
receive an error code yet. That is added in a follow-up patch.
