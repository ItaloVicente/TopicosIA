DESCRIPTION:

MB-33296 [SR]: DM enforces dur-impossible if Majority cannot be satisfied

This patch fixes the definition of Majority in DurabilityMonitor:
  majority = chain_size / 2 + 1
always, even in the case where the chain contains Undefined nodes.

With this patch the DM checks if 'durability-impossible' every time a
new write is added for tracking.

Note that a proper error code is returned by the DM but not yet
processed by the caller (VBucket). That means, the clients will not
receive an error code yet. That is added in a dedicated patch.

Note that this patch implicitly fixes MB-33172. From now on, the
DurabilityMonitor returns durability-impossible if the user issues a
SyncWrite but the replication-chain is not set (rather than throwing an
expection).

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Probably worth adding this to the subject so it's associated in Jira.

Line:948, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> This needs to happen even earlier, before we put the item in the HashTable - that'll allow you to tell the client about it. (e.g. VBucket::set and related functions).

Line:20, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:948, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> You're right, we would need to clean up the HT at this point otherwise.
Just removing from here and keeping this a DM-patch. The implementation at VB level is covered in MB-33396.
