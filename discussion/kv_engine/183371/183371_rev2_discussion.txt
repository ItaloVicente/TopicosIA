DESCRIPTION:

Use the logger directly from cbsasl

Previously memcached would set a log function in cbsasl
and in cbsasl we would (unconditionally) format the log
output and then call the callback to log the content.

This patch use the logger directly from cbsasl with
the log macros which would bypass formatting the
content if the log entry is supposed to be dropped.

It currently use the same output format as the
old logger, but that should be fixed in a new patch
to match the way we log clients in the core by
prefixing the connection etc).
