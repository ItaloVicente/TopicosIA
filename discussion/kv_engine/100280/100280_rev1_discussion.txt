DESCRIPTION:

MB-31495: Fix bug in getRandomKey

This patch fixes a bug where getRandomKey would loop indefinitely if
start == 0.

The bug is that we check for curr == start before checking if
curr == max.  See the original code below.

start = 0;
curr = start;
VBucketPtr vb = getVBucket(Vbid(curr++));
while (!vb || vb->getState() != vbucket_state_active) {
            if (curr == start) {
                return GetValue(NULL, ENGINE_KEY_ENOENT);
            }
            if (curr == max) {
                curr = 0;
            }

            vb = getVBucket(Vbid(curr++));
        }

Assumme the vbucket is empty. The first time we enter the while loop
curr == 1.  curr != start and curr != max and so we will call
getVBucket and increment curr to 2.  We repeat until curr == 1024.
On going round the while loop again curr != start, but curr == max
and so set curr = 0.

We then call getVbucket and increment curr to 1.  On going round the
while loop again curr != start (as it is 1), and hence we loop
indefinitely.
