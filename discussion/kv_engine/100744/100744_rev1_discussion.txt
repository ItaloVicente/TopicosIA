Please do NOT commit this. Even though it's an empty merge, it's still a new commit and hence kicks off a new build. For a release that's days away from GA, this causes panic in QE and PM.

It'll likely be weeks, not days. I'd suggest abandoning this merge (and Trond's equivalent merge from yesterday, http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/100642/-1..1 ). I have already confirmed with Wayne and PM that there are no code changes that need to be merged up, and marked the so-called "missing" commits as OK so we won't be reminded of them in future.
