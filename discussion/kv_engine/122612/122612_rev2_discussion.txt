DESCRIPTION:

MB-36371: Add MagmaKVStore::makeCompactionContext

Add a function to MagmaKVStore to create a compaction_ctx object.
For now this will just supply it with a compaction_ctx object created
by EPBucket. In the future, we will expand
EPBucket::makeCompactionContext to set a correct purge_before_ts
when compaction is not driven by ns_server.

This probably won't work. The call to get dropped collections to create the eraserContext() does a read to the localDB. That would be hugely expensive given the number of compactions. There needs to be a less expensive call to generate the dropped collections list from memory.

Line:2459, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> This requires a read to the localDb. The is too expensive given the number of compactions that magma does. We need a less expensive way to get the list of dropped collections.

Line:2459, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> I don't follow. Given in the process of performing a compaction you're going to read/write many documents (I assume), why is performing a single read of one local document a problem?

Furthermore, that one local document is very likely to be in your block cache (given it's needed for every comaction) - so I doubt it's going to have any real performance impact.

(BTW, ultimately it's the responsibility of the (Magma)KVStore to implement getDroppedCollections() record the set of dropped collections in a persistent manner. If you have some other way you want to implement it then feel free to investigate that.)

You are correct that the code path is implemented in magma. Unfortunately, I don't know of a less expensive way to get the dropped collections from the collections code. If there were a less expensive way, we'd use it. 
The magma compaction code is so sensitive to code path issues that we had to hide a stringstream in a data structure rather than use it from the stack. My worry is this added code path will have dire consequences. I guess we can leave as is and if it causes performance issues, we'll have to get relief from the collections code.

At this point, might as well let it go in and adjust if there are problems.
