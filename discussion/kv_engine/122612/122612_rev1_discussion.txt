DESCRIPTION:

MB-36371: Add MagmaKVStore::makeCompactionContext

Add a function to MagmaKVStore to create a compaction_ctx object.
For now this will just supply it with a compaction_ctx object created
by EPBucket. In the future, we will expand
EPBucket::makeCompactionContext to set a correct purge_before_ts
when compaction is not driven by ns_server.
