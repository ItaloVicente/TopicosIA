DESCRIPTION:

MB-36249: Rename io_write_bytes to io_document_write_bytes

The 'io_write_bytes' statistic measures the cumulative number of user
document data (key + metadata + value) written to disk. The
similary-named 'io_total_write_bytes' measures the cumulative number
of bytes written to disk, including B-Tree overheads, and repeated
writes from compaction.

Rename io_write_bytes to io_document_write_bytes to make the
difference between the two more explicit.
