DESCRIPTION:

MB-39620: Add support for ifconfig commands [2.0/3]

This patch contains the implementation for the ifconfig
commands (and a unit test suite which tests them).

It is currently not possible to fully use the new commands
as it is in "conflict" with the normal config reload (it'll
give you undefined behavior as it might drop and open ports
etc).

Change-Id: I56eea6cbcb2e0d4b073f4247c29d7308dc40d67b
