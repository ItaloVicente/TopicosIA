DESCRIPTION:

MB-39620: Add support for ifconfig commands [2.0/3]

This patch contains the implementation for the ifconfig
commands (and a unit test suite which tests them).

It is currently not possible to fully use the new commands
as it is in "conflict" with the normal config reload (it'll
give you undefined behavior as it might drop and open ports
etc).

Change-Id: I56eea6cbcb2e0d4b073f4247c29d7308dc40d67b

Line:32, daemon/network_interface_description.cc -> This probably wants to be is_number_unsigned assuming you don't want to accept floats or negative port numbers ;)

Line:80, daemon/network_interface_description.cc -> Note for future reference - you can also do `if(json.contains("system")) ...`

Line:26, daemon/network_interface_description.h -> If we don't modify nlohmann::json here we can pass by const&; that also lets us use json_fwd.hpp.

Line:533, daemon/network_interface_manager.cc -> You might want to look at folly::SocketAddress which already handles the different platforms and wraps up in C++ objects.

Line:19, daemon/network_interface_manager.h -> We should be able to forward-declare TlsConfiguration at least; possibly some of the others here?

Line:16, daemon/tls_configuration.cc -> Given you don't need ownership here you could just use const& or even std::string_view so it can be used by anything string-like.

Similary elsewhere in here.

Line:32, daemon/network_interface_description.cc -> Done

Line:80, daemon/network_interface_description.cc -> Hmm... that fails to compile for me... I don't have a contains method

Line:26, daemon/network_interface_description.h -> I did.

The validation of the JSON fields populates the object with default values for the optional fields. That simplified the initialization of the object to not have to check for their existence when I assigned them in the constructor at line 62.

I've changed the assigments in that other constructor and no longer update the JSON with default values

Line:533, daemon/network_interface_manager.cc -> I've got a patch on top of all of this which moves over to folly's asyncseversocket... but it is currently failing on Windows... (this is however mostly a "copy" of the method we had to create server-sockets previously. (I could have spent time trying to wrap one into the other, but in the next few patches the other one goes away)

(and one annoying part with Folly's code here is that it didn't make it that easy to create a SocketAddress of a given address family...)

Line:19, daemon/network_interface_manager.h -> yes.. (btw. this is one of the things I really find annoying with C++.. that the burden of a dead slow compiler force the developer to manually forward declare the classes explicit rather than just include the correct header)

Line:16, daemon/tls_configuration.cc -> oops.. done

Line:19, daemon/network_interface_manager.h -> True. Hopefully Modules in C++20 will help here (once it's widely available).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:19, daemon/network_interface_manager.h -> (I had to revert some of these checks due to some platforms not liking that. In addition I had to rewrite the is_number_unsigned as it "randomly" failed for me for positive integer values just because the underlying datatype it had chosen wasn't unsigned.. added a unit test to verify all of that)
