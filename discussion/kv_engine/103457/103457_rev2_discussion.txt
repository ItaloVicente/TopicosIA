DESCRIPTION:

[SR]: Allow DcpConsumer to receive and process DCP_COMMIT messages

- Add support for receiving DCP_COMMIT messages via mcbp protocol from
  a active node to a replica.

- Update the various commit() interfaces to use the mutations' key to
  identify the mutation instead of the prepared seqno.

- In ep-engine itself, call the VBucket::commit() method when a
  DCP_COMMIT message is received by a Passive stream. Note that in
  this use of commit() the seqno to use has been decided by the source
  (active) node, so it is necessary to expand VBucket::commit() and
  related methods to allow a seqno to be passed in (and not allow the
  CheckpointManager to generate one).
