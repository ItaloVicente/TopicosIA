DESCRIPTION:

MB-32573 [SR]: Allow DcpConsumer to receive and process DCP_COMMIT messages

- Add support for receiving DCP_COMMIT messages via mcbp protocol from
  a active node to a replica.

- Update the various commit() interfaces to use the mutations' key to
  identify the mutation instead of the prepared seqno.

- In ep-engine itself, call the VBucket::commit() method when a
  DCP_COMMIT message is received by a Passive stream. Note that in
  this use of commit() the seqno to use has been decided by the source
  (active) node, so it is necessary to expand VBucket::commit() and
  related methods to allow a seqno to be passed in (and not allow the
  CheckpointManager to generate one).

With this patch a SyncWrite request can complete it's full lifecycle:

1. Active node accepts mutation with durability requirements,
   processed locally as a pending SyncWrite.

2. Replica node recieves DCP_PREPARE message, processes it locally and
   sends a SEQNO_ACK message back to active node.

3. Active node receives SEQO_ACK. Once durability requirements met:
   - Commits locally
   - Notifies client that mutation is successful
   - Sends DCP_COMMIT to replica.

4. Replica node recieves DCP_COMMIT message, and processes it by
   committing the pending SyncWrite.
