DESCRIPTION:

TSAN: Ensure we don't try and access freed ThreadGate

TSAN issue has been observed in setupForImplicitCompactionTest() where
we try and access the ThreadGate tg from
postPurgeSeqnoImplicitCompactionHook() after it's gone out of scope,
due to setupForImplicitCompactionTest() finishing execution. This is
due to Magma triggering a second implicit compaction after the first
one fails.

To fix this, store the ThreadGate behind a shared ptr and give the
postPurgeSeqnoImplicitCompactionHook() a copy of it so it's around
for the life time of the hook. Which is simpler then
removing/replacing the hook after it's been executed once. As this
would require extra locking and atomic types.

Line:330, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/magma_bucket_tests.cc -> I think this is the wrong way to address this lifetime problem.

I would suggest instead that you ensure that whoever is keeping a reference to ThreadData (Magma?) removes that reference before ThreadGate does out of scope.

That could be by shutting down the engine at the end of this testcase before the ThreadGate does out of scope (instead of waiting until the test TearDown function), or simply resetting postPurgeSeqnoImplicitCompactionHook to an empty function before ThreadGate is deleted - that's much more idiomatic given we don't really have shared ownership here.

Patch Set 2:

might just be worth refactoring the tests to use the implicitCompaction test API added here https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/165247 and dropping the data sizes such that magma won't run implicit compaction of it's own accord

ah didn't realise this was already in, I'll refactor the test to use the new api :)
