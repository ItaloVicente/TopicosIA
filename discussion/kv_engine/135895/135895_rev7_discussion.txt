DESCRIPTION:

MB-31869: Update PassiveStream::last_seqno only on success

Currently we update last_seqno on receipt of a DCP message but before
we process it.

Initially noticed during the investigation for MB-41255, this becomes
a pre-requirement for http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/101187
where we disable the DCP buffering at Consumer.

Issue with DCP buffer disabled:
 - Consumer receives a message
 - PassiveStream::messageReceived() updates the (strictly) Monotonic
last_seqno
 - We process the message and we hit OOM -> Replication Throttling
triggers
 - When DCP buffering is disabled we just return EWOULD_BLOCK
 - The Consumer is paused
 - At some point we recover from OOM and we unpause the connection
 - memcached executes the connection and processes again the failed
message
 - We executed again PassiveStream::messageReceived() and we fail when
we try to re-set last_seqno to the same seqno

With this patch we just update last_seqno on success while enforcing the
existing validation.
Tests implemented for http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/101187
cover this change too.
