DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: move functions closer to where they're used

move mcbp_execute_packet next to the two methods it calls,
and invalid_datatype is only called from the method
which validates the packet contraints.

Note sure of the value of this - you've essentially broken the history of these two functions by moving them. 

Also, I would have thought most people will use an IDE shortcut to go to a functionn definition, so is there much value in actually moving them closer to use?

Not really. the entire history is still stored in git ;)

Normally people would use IDE's but every now and then (at least myself) end up in vi / emacs looking at stuff... the analogy could be to our 80 character line width ;)  "everyone" is using big screens and IDE's with a lot more space ;)

Well, if you do `git blame` on this code it'll show this commit as modifying that entire function - looking like the code was only added today. One would then typically do a `git show <THIS SHA>, see this was actually a move, then they'd have to do *another* `git blame THIS_SHA~1 -- path/to/file.cc, and examine that to see the true blame history.

My argument is that cost isn't worth the benefit of functions being in a different order.

Not an issue if you use `-M`

I'll concede -M works in this instance, but I've had limited success when large chunks of code moves - take for example when we moved DCP and TAP code around in spock development; which created no end of merge conflicts.

I still feel the cost/benefit of this kind of change isn't worth it.
