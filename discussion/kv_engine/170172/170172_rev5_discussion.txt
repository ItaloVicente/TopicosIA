DESCRIPTION:

MB-50647: Ensure collections tests interact with ConnMap realistically

Creating or destroying a stream for a DcpProducer will add/remove a
vb->connection mapping to/from ConnStore.

In normal operation, ConnStore would also contain a cookie->connection
entry. However, CollectionsDcpTest suite tests did not update this
mapping.

In this mixed state, some ConnMap operations (e.g.,
ConnMap::vbConnectionExists) would work, but others (e.g.,
DcpConnMap::vbucketStateChanged) would not.

To avoid tests relying on behaviour which will not reflect normal
operation, ensure these tests add connections to ConnMap.
