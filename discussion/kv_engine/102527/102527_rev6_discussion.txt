DESCRIPTION:

Fix missing only-once header defintion and add test for it

Add #pragma once, to make sure that we never re-define
these header files.

Also add python test so that we can made
sure that all headers use a only-once definition
header guard e.g. the presence of #pragma once or
#ifndef HEADER, #define HEADER and #endif.
