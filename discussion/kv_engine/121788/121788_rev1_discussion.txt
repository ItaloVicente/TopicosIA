DESCRIPTION:

Remove logging when we do delayed disconnect of clients

As part of moving to bufferevent I added a log entry when
we failed to shut down the connection immediately to
make it easier to debug disconnect issues.

Now that we've fully migrated over to bufferevent we
may nuke the log entry.
