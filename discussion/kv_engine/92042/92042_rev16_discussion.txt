DESCRIPTION:

Add getNumOfVBucketsInState method

Adds functionality to KV buckets to be able to retrieve the number
of underlying vbuckets that are in a given state, i.e. active, replica,
dead, and pending.

This functionality will be used in the future by the hifi_mfu hash
table eviction algorithm to determine the percentage of replica
documents to evict.

Line:790, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> See later comment on the `undefined` state being undesirable. I think we can rework this to avoid the need for it:

# Split updateStateCounts in two - have it decrement the count only if it's already an existing vBucket (i.e. if(vb) is true here); and then increment for the new count just before the end of the function.

If you change the type of vbCounts to an array of NonNegativeCounters as mentioned earlier, the code becomes simple enough you could probably inline it:

     if (vb) {
         vbCounts[oldState]--;
         ...
     } 
     vbCounts[to]++;
     return ENGINE_SUCCESS;
 }

Line:2559, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> You can basically get rid of all this code if you instead use a NonNegativeCounter with ThrowExceptionUnderflowPolicy as the UnderflowPolicy.

Line:344, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Does this need to be public? Surely we should be allowing external callers to change the vBucket counts (it should be owned by the class).

Line:1023, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> You'll simplify your code significantly here if you instead make this an array indexed on vbucket_state_t.

Line:27, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> I'm not convinced we need to add a new enumeration value for undefined - how would we legitimately expect a vBucket to be in this state? 

I think adding a new state just complicates the code as we are basically explicitly saying we permit undefined behaviour / state, which feels like a bad idea.

See the comment in kv_bucket.cc for how to avoid the need for this.

Line:790, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> thanks for the suggestion - gone for this approach.

Line:2559, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Done

Line:344, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> removed so that counts are a member of vbMap.

Line:1023, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Done

Line:27, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> removed - as suggested.
