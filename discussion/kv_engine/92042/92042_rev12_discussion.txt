DESCRIPTION:

Add getNumOfVBucketsInState method

Adds functionality to KV buckets to be able to retrieve the number
of underlying vbuckets that are in a given state, i.e. active, replica,
dead, and pending.

This functionality will be used in the future by the hifi_mfu hash
table eviction algorithm to determine the percentage of replica
documents to evict.
