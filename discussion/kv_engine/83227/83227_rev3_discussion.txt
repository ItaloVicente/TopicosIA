DESCRIPTION:

MB-25342: Collection UID in the Manifest

Primarily update the JSON specification so that the 'set_collections'
command requires that collections are given a UID.

The purpose of the UID is to enable the collections management to
handle background deletion of a collection whilst a new generation of
the same collection is created. Note that many previous generations
could exist if sequences of add/delete/add/delete were issued quickly.

The UID will also be used by DCP so that clients who use collections
filters, reconnect to the collection they were previously streaming,
rather than reconnecting to the 'golf' collection and not realising it
now stores documents about cars instead of clubs. By requiring a DCP
client re-connects to collection:UID they won't fall foul of
connecting to a new collection of the same name.

The UID must be a JSON string that stores a 64-bit unsigned integer
encoded in hex.

Note it is the cluster managements responsibility to ensure that a UID
is unique enough that it doesn't collide with a previous  generation
before that generation has been fully deleted (note once a generation
has been fully deleted, a UID could be re-used).
