DESCRIPTION:

MB-25342: Collection UID in the Manifest

Primarily update the JSON specification so that the 'set_collections'
command requires that collections are given a UID.

The purpose of the UID is to allow KV-engine to see that a collection
was deleted and recreated without ever seeing the intermediate delete.
The collections management code will identify that it knows about a
collection, but because of the UID it can determine if the collection
it knows about is now defunct.

A secondary purpose is that DCP may allow clients to use UIDs when
filtering collections.

The UID must be a JSON string that stores a 64-bit unsigned integer
encoded in hex.

Note it is the cluster managements responsibility to ensure that a UID
is unique enough that it doesn't collide with a previous generation
before that generation has been fully deleted (note once a generation
has been fully deleted, a UID could be re-used).

(4 comments)

Mostly looks good; couple of minor comments / tweaks.
Line:46, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.h -> Might warrant a brief description to the class / purpose of it (compile-time dispatch by the look of it?)

Line:87, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.h -> Nit: Do we need the `::` prefix here (I don't think we have our own `std` namespace?

Nit(2): Slightly more consistent to hoist any type aliases to the top of the class definition.

Line:140, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.h -> Can this be const?

Line:195, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.h -> I think you can make these `constexpr`.

Line:140, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.h -> Sadly not as i'm calling into cJSON which doesn't use const, so i'd have to const_cast

Line:195, engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.h -> done after some fiddling
