DESCRIPTION:

MB-25342: Collection UID in the Manifest

Primarily update the JSON specification so that the 'set_collections'
command requires that collections are given a UID.

The purpose of the UID is to allow KV-engine to see that a collection
was deleted and recreated without ever seeing the intermediate delete.
The collections management code will identify that it knows about a
collection, but because of the UID it can determine if the collection
it knows about is now defunct.

A secondary purpose is that DCP may allow clients to use UIDs when
filtering collections.

The UID must be a JSON string that stores a 64-bit unsigned integer
encoded in hex.

Note it is the cluster managements responsibility to ensure that a UID
is unique enough that it doesn't collide with a previous generation
before that generation has been fully deleted (note once a generation
has been fully deleted, a UID could be re-used).
