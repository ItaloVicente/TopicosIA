DESCRIPTION:

MB-48694: Ensure float values are formatted correctly for CBStats

In introducing the StatCollector classes to support Prometheus
exposition, all string formatting for CBStats was moved to using
fmt::format_to.

As Prometheus only exposes double values, all floating point values
were converted to doubles.

Unfortunately, it appears fmt has unexpected behaviour on floats which
have been converted to doubles.

e.g.,

 0.01f

would be formatted as:

 "0.009999999776482582"

Whereas the "old" cbstats behaviour (formatted by stringstream) would
produce the expected

 "0.01"

Corrected by adding a float overload for StatCollector::addStat; now
floats will not be converted before formatting for cbstats, but will be
for Prometheus.
