DESCRIPTION:

MB-36554: Make sure the engine won't reallocate tracing vector

The memory accounting could get out of sync if the underlying
engine tried to add a trace element and the tracer needed to
reallocate memory in the vector. To work around this problem
make sure that there there is at least 10 free elements in
the trace array before calling into the engine.
