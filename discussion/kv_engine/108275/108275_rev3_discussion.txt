DESCRIPTION:

MB-32734 [SR]: Add syncDelete flag to KVStore metadata

Prepared SyncDeletes require slightly different handling to "normal"
deletes - they represent a _potential_ delete assuming the key is
Committed - but are not technically deleted themselves.

This distinction is most seen on disk; where we need to persist
Prepared SyncDeletes such that they can be subsequently loaded from
disk (e.g. during warmup), but they should _not_ be subject to things
like tombstone puring which "real" deletes are.

As such, Prepared SyncDeletes should be persisted to disk as valid,
not-yet-deleted documents (in the separate Prepare namespace). To
achieve this, but still be able to distinguish them from SyncWrites,
we need to add a new flag in each KVStore's metadata. When reading
Prepared SyncDeletes from disk, if this flag is set then the returned
Item should be marked as a (Prepared) delete.

Line:318, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore-metadata.h -> unit8_t raw : 3;
?

Line:1551, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Is it feasible to move the (!itm->isPending()) check into itm->isDeleted() ? Ie, always excluding pending Prepares from itm->isDeleted?

It would be nice for logic consistency, but maybe it break would break a lot of stuff around?

Line:1551, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> If you recall, this was one of the alternate solutions I looked at.

Basically you can't really come up with a single solution which works in all cases - sometimes you need to *include* pending (deleted) items, sometimes you need to exclude them.

Overall I decided to go with keeping "isDeleted" meaning "item is marked as deleted", even though sometimes for pending items you don't want to include them.

Line:1551, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Yeah I remember that, I wasn't sure that it was exactly your attempt. Fine then.
