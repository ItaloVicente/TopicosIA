DESCRIPTION:

MB-33107: Fix intermittent failure in ObjectRegistryTest

The tests immediately before ObjectRegistryTest have an consistency in
the type used by loaderFun() - callers pass in a std::map, but
loaderFun() expects a std::set. This compiles (and apparently runs!)
as reinterpret_cast<> is used to convert between them.

However, when running on Windows wit jemalloc; this later results in
heap corruption manifesting in ObjectRegistryTest's SetUp method.

What happens is that when the std::map is deallocated the internal
nodes are not of the expected size, which causes cb_sized_free() and
ultimately je_sdallocx() with an incorrect size to free. This results
in the heap corruption.

Fix by using the correct type when calling loaderFun().
