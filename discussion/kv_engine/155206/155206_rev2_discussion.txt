DESCRIPTION:

Remove kv_engine-specific CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED

We can just inherit the top-level make (tlm)'s setting; which avoids
having to maintain the minimum for each project.

This fixes the following CMake warning:

    CMake Warning (dev) at kv_engine/engines/ep/tests/CMakeLists.txt:120 (target_sources):
      Policy CMP0076 is not set: target_sources() command converts relative paths
      to absolute.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0076" for policy details.  Use
      the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

      An interface source of target "ep-engine_ep_unit_tests" has a relative
      path.
