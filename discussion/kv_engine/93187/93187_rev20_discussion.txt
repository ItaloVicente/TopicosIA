DESCRIPTION:

MB-29500: Change client's cursor from a string to be a weak_ptr

Rather than using a std::string (chosen by the cursor owner) for
looking up cursors (allowing for issues such as two clients hitting
the same cursor), use a weak_ptr to locate the cursor.

The use of a weak_ptr allows for a clients cursor to become degraded
simply by removing it from the core cursor list (which stores
shared_ptr).
