DESCRIPTION:

MB-29500: Change client's cursor from a string to be a weak_ptr

Rather than using a std::string (chosen by the cursor owner) for
looking up cursors (allowing for issues such as two clients hitting
the same cursor), use a weak_ptr to locate the cursor.

The use of a weak_ptr allows for a clients cursor to become degraded
simply by removing it from the core cursor list (which stores
shared_ptr).

Functionality looks good. Couple of performance-related comments on cursor.h; but tbh if we aren't commonly creating / copying Cursors (which I think is the case) then it probably won't make any difference...
Line:40, engines/ep/src/cursor.h -> Not sure how hot this is, but technically this is a pessimisation as you don't need to acquire the cursorLock in the constructor (as it's not possible for another other thread to know about the object being created yet) - so you can just assign the weak_ptr - possibly in an initialiser list to avoid default-constructing.

Line:44, engines/ep/src/cursor.h -> Same here I think; you only need to acquire the other's mutex.

Line:52, engines/ep/src/cursor.h -> Similary here.
