DESCRIPTION:

MB-29500: Change client's cursor to be a weak_ptr

A simple conceptual change, rather than manage client's just holding
a std::string which is their 'cursor', if we give them a weak_ptr
this allows stale cursors to be degraded by kicking them out of the
checkpoint manager.

Change-Id: I3779fcf1db751bde55ee1b2a90715935b79b19b6
