DESCRIPTION:

MB-29500: Change client's cursor to be a weak_ptr

A simple conceptual change, rather than manage client's just holding
a std::string which is their 'cursor', if we give them a weak_ptr
this allows stale cursors to be degraded by kicking them out of the
checkpoint manager.

Not reviewed in full, I was just checking the approach used here while looking at spurious warning messages in MB-29858.
Line:1008, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Might be worth changing this function to take a reference then we can avoid even needing to make this check here.

Line:1008, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> In the weak_ptr model, this check occurs because the client passes a pointer which they obtained from a weak cursor pointer (via weak_ptr::get), hence null means they've had their cursor 'degraded' and we should ignore it, making this method take a ref is possible, but the non _UNLOCKED method is still going to need a nullptr check before then passing a reference down to the _UNLOCKED method

Line:1008, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Ok, makes sense - thanks.

The main advantage to passing a reference was that I think it's invalid to call this function with a null Cursor - and so if possible we should simply not call it.

I hit a number of instances when investigating MB-29858 where this log message was spamming the logs quite a bit. 

I looked into having getNumItemsForCursor return an optional<size_t> (see http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/95200/), but then I realised that your change here should hopefully avoid most (all?) of the instances where we don't have a valid cursor anymore, as we now use the weak_ptr to hold the cursor instead of just knowing it's name.

See also http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/94958/  which adds a bool to track if the cursor is registered. I don't think you'll need that anymore once you move to weak_ptr.
