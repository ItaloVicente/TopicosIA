DESCRIPTION:

MB-54587: Don't fail startup if we can't get timestamp

Previously the audit daemon would refuse to start if
it encountered any "problems" trying to read, parse
or pick out the timestamp from the old audit file.

This patch change the behavior to "ignore" all such
errors and use the "current time" in the filename
instead of the oldest event in the file when it
encountered any problems.

It'll still fail if there is an IO Error reported
from the OS which won't go away after retrying
