DESCRIPTION:

MB-54587: Don't fail startup if we can't get timestamp

Previously the audit daemon would refuse to start if it encountered
any "problems" trying to read, parse or pick out the timestamp from
the old audit file.

This patch change the behavior to "ignore" all such errors and use
the "current time" in the filename instead of the oldest event in
the file when it encountered any problems.

It'll still fail if there is an IO Error reported from the OS which
won't go away after retrying
