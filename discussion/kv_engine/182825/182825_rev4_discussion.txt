DESCRIPTION:

MB-54587: Don't fail startup if we can't get timestamp

Previously the audit daemon would refuse to start if
it encountered any "problems" trying to read, parse
or pick out the timestamp from the old audit file.

This patch change the behavior to "ignore" all such
errors and use the "current time" in the filename
instead of the oldest event in the file when it
encountered any problems.

It'll still fail if there is an IO Error reported
from the OS which won't go away after retrying

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Note: Your editor is wrapping the body pretty tightly here - 72 chars is the de-facto standard (e.g. https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#wrap-72) - it's also where Gerrit displays the ruler.

Line:161, auditd/src/auditfile.cc -> This is strictly an incorrect file location now, although if we only call tryGetTimestamp() from cleanup_old_logfile() it probably doesn't matter...

Line:194, auditd/src/auditfile.cc -> Suggest expanding this to tell the user what we are doing about it - e.g. " - using current time as timestamp"

Line:205, auditd/src/auditfile.cc -> Style: I'd probably structure this as a for() loop as that makes it obvious from the start how many times we are going to retry for - as it is the reader must scan the whole block looking for where the break / return / throw is...

Line:216, auditd/src/auditfile.cc -> Do we know why the rename would fail - is this a Windows thing? 😞

Line:55, auditd/tests/auditfile_test.cc -> You could also use folly::writeFile():

 EXPECT_TRUE(folly::writeFile(content, testdir + "/audit.log"));

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not sure what we're practicing as I've seen tons of commit messages with line lengths way about 100 characters....

Line:194, auditd/src/auditfile.cc -> Done

Line:205, auditd/src/auditfile.cc -> it's a leftover from something else.. I'll refactor it.. (the reason it is a do-while loop is that we're going to throw the exception up to the caller if we don't want to deal with it)

Line:216, auditd/src/auditfile.cc -> rename may fail for a number of reasons on all platforms; some may be temporary, some may be persistent.

Line:55, auditd/tests/auditfile_test.cc -> Done
