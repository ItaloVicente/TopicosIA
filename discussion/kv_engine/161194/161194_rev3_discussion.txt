DESCRIPTION:

Recommit MB-47604: Set checkpoint every batch magma config for nexus

The original was reverted as magma implicit compactions were running
during a test and purging an item when we set this config value. At
this point in the branch we should have disabled magma implcit
compactions for now.

This reverts commit a296dd3cf695225c0ca1e6543dc498be548f9e9d.
