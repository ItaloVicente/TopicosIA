DESCRIPTION:

MB-48925 3/3: Don't extend GlobalTask lifetime past KVBucket

Patch 3/3 in addressing the user-after free issue highlighted in
MB-48925.

This is a partial revert of "MB-23086: Delete all bucket tasks before
deleting the bucket" (853dd6d). Change
ExecutorPool::unregisterTaskable to no longer return the tasks which
were still outstanding when unregistered; instead just remove all
reference to them from the ExecutorPool.

The Taskable (i.e. Bucket) which created them may still have a
reference, but that last reference will be removed when the Bucket is
deleted.

I believe the original issues which patch 853dd6d was added to avoid
have now been fixed - namely that some Tasks were holding onto
KVBucket resources (VBucket for example) and hence resulting in that
Task attempting to call schedule on a taskable (Bucket) which had
already been deleted.
