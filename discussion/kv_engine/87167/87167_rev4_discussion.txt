DESCRIPTION:

MB-26220: [5/n] Encode/Decode using a better/faster algo

As per suggestion from Brett Lawson [@brett19], we have updated to
a different encoding scheme that maps the range of 0-2mins in
microseconds in a better manner.

Details (from Brett):
====================
I originally started by writing an IEEE794-esque solution, but it
was substantially more complex than seemed reasonable
(numeric normalization is hard). I figured that I could probably
use some kind of power algorithm instead and get reasonable
results, since it was obvious we wanted more precision for lower
numbers.  I simply started tuning the number around trying to find
something that best reflected our desired range.  Originally that number
was 1.68755, I added the additional multiplication/division by 2 to make
the power number less complicated and shift a bit more precision down to
the low-end and ended up with something that worked. [1.74] was finally
reached by trial and error.
