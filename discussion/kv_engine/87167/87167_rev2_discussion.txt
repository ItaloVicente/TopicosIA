DESCRIPTION:

MB-26220: [5/n] Encode/Decode using a better/faster algo

As per suggestion from Brett Lawson [@brett19], we have updated to
a different encoding scheme that maps the range of 0-2mins in
microseconds in a better manner.

Details (from Brett):
====================
I originally started by writing an IEEE794-esque solution, but it
was substantially more complex than seemed reasonable
(numeric normalization is hard). I figured that I could probably
use some kind of power algorithm instead and get reasonable
results, since it was obvious we wanted more precision for lower
numbers.  I simply started tuning the number around trying to find
something that best reflected our desired range.  Originally that number
was 1.68755, I added the additional multiplication/division by 2 to make
the power number less complicated and shift a bit more precision down to
the low-end and ended up with something that worked. [1.74] was finally
reached by trial and error.

Coverage Data:
=============
Possible Values: 65536
Unique Values: 65535
Min Value: 0 us
Max Value: 120125042 us

Approach looks good. Couple of minor suggestions on the implementation.
Line:66, tests/tracing/tracing_test.cc -> Nit: prefer C++ style cast.

Line:86, tracing/tracer.cc -> Magic value - can we derive this instead of hard-coding it? Say via plugging std::numeric_limits<uint16_t>::max() into the formula?

Line:80, tracing/tracer.h -> Please update this comment - either remove, or add in the definition of the encoding.

Line:86, tracing/tracer.cc -> We should actually set a slightly lower max bound to ensure differing floating point rounding won't cause any issues here, additionally we should probably reserve MAX_VAL to represent +INF (out of range).
