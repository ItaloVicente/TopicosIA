DESCRIPTION:

MB-55939: Catch any exceptions thrown in MutationLog dtor

If the MutationLog fails to write to disk when it is being destroyed
(while writing out the header and closing the file), then it throws a
WriteException. This is not caught by the calling ItemAccessVisitor
ctor (quite reasonably as destructors should never fail) and results
in process termination as the uncaught exception is propogated up the
stack.

Address this by catching any thrown exceptions inside MutationLog dtor
and just ignoring them - there's not much else we can sensibly do at
this point.
