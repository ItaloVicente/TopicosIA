DESCRIPTION:

MB-43529: Make dirtyQueueAge a NonNegativeCounter

To try to ensure that we can't underflow the dirtyQueueAge value we
should make it a NonNegativeCounter. This highlighted an interesting
case where we could in fact make it underflow if we de-duped an Item
in the CheckpointManager as flushing would then attempt to decrement
the queueTime of the newer version of the item (rather than the
original queueTime). Correct this by having the de-dupe code overwrite
the queueTime if the Item has not yet been persisted.

We could
Line:328, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> we could set the policy to clamp to zero instead (same as previous behaviour) if preferred

I assume we have some test coverage of the fixed issue (once you start using NonNegativeCounter?)
Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Given this improvement highlights a legitimate bug (the de-dupe case), suggest we modify the MB title & patch subject to make them focused on the bug; that will help future readers / searchers in Jira if they are looking for issues relating to broken queueAge.

(Or if you really want to you could split out a separate MB for the de-duped queue age, but that's overkill IMHO).

Line:328, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> The code as-is seems reasonable - logically that item has been queued since the initial queue time; even if the physical item which represents it has changed.

Recall you'll get ClampAtZero policy "for free" once we disable development asserts (assuming you're not explicitly enabling ThrowExceptionPolicy for that counter).

Line:310, engines/ep/src/item.h -> Nit: You could just provide a default argument for existing setQueuedTime() method (https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rf-default-args)

MB17653_ItemsRemaining in StreamTest failed 90% of the time with the NonNegativeCounter. I'm sure some others would have failed too but I hit this one first
Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:310, engines/ep/src/item.h -> Done
