DESCRIPTION:

MB-52054: Use folly::F14FastMap over std::unordered_map

Use folly::F14FastMap over std::unordered_map for StatCollector::Labels
& in PrometheusStatCollector as it helps to reduce our memory foot print
by 16 Bytes for each map. Also its memory management when storing items
is more efficient, improving speed and memory over heads.

Line:147, include/statistics/labelled_collector.h -> in contrast, unordered_map _is_ still used in this file - should keep the include for IWYU (or possibly flip this over too, if you fancy)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:147, include/statistics/labelled_collector.h -> I'm going to try and nuke this in another patch, but yes probably worth leaving it un touched for now
