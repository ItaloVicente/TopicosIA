DESCRIPTION:

MB-52054: Use folly::F14FastMap over std::unordered_map

Use folly::F14FastMap over std::unordered_map for StatCollector::Labels
& in PrometheusStatCollector as it helps to reduce our memory foot print
by 16 Bytes for each map. Also its memory management when storing items
is more efficient, improving speed and memory over heads.

Line:188, engines/ep/src/sizes.cc -> There should only be one collector per scrape request, but every byte helps :partyparrot:

Was this primarily for testing, or are we interested in watching this going forward i.e., do we want a test which will fail if the map is bigger in the future, say after a folly update?

I'd have thought differences in per-entry memory cost would be more interesting - though in general the number of labels is quite small, so maybe not

Line:16, include/statistics/labelled_collector.h -> This doesn't look to be used specifically in this file?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:188, engines/ep/src/sizes.cc -> I'll remove these as we're probably not interested in the long run. With regards to the entries I would expect that we normally have two items (IIRC) and they'll be dominated by the size of the string that we're storing so in some ways we should be more concerned how the structure is managing memory and what its baseline is.
