DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Cancel RangeScans that exist for "too long"

A RangeScan cannot 'exist' indefinitely as disk cannot be released by
compaction. This commit adds a task that will 'force' cancel any
RangeScan that has existed for longer than a configuration defined
duration (180 seconds by default). This cancelling occurs irrespective
of the scan state/progress.

A cancellation task is created per vbucket and shares code with the
durability timeout task. The idea is that when a scan is created, the
task will change from sleep(-1) to sleep(180). When the task wakes it
will check the state of the vbucket's scans and force cancel any that
have a 180 second existence. At this point the task may sleep(-1) or
set a sleep time based on the vbucket's scans, e.g. if scans remain
the sleep time is set to be the duration until the next scan would
of exceeded the 180 seconds.
