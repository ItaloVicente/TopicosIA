DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Cancel RangeScans that exist for "too long"

A RangeScan cannot 'exist' indefinitely as disk cannot be released by
compaction. This commit adds a watch-dog task that is responsible
for 'force' cancelling any RangeScan that exists for longer than some
configuration defined duration (180 seconds by default).

The cancellation task is created per vbucket, with that one task
responsible for waking when a scan would violate the max-duration.
Even if that scan has completed, the task will still wake and check,
with part of that check being to update the sleep of the task to
forever or the next expected "violation" of the max-duration.

Change-Id: I409b00ab08772fa36af8f2fad83c0b083fe26165
