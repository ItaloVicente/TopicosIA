DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Cancel RangeScans that exist for "too long"

A RangeScan cannot 'exist' indefinitely as disk cannot be released by
compaction. This commit adds a task that will 'force' cancel any
RangeScan that has existed for longer than a configuration defined
duration (180 seconds by default). This cancelling occurs irrespective
of the scan state/progress.

A cancellation task is created per vbucket and shares code with the
durability timeout task. The idea is that when a scan is created, the
task will change from sleep(-1) to sleep(180). When the task wakes it
will check the state of the vbucket's scans and force cancel any that
have a 180 second existence. At this point the task may sleep(-1) or
set a sleep time based on the vbucket's scans, e.g. if scans remain
the sleep time is set to be the duration until the next scan would
of exceeded the 180 seconds.

Line:1358, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Do we want to make this dynamic? Seems like it could be useful to adjust at runtime

Line:134, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_owner.cc -> Without any sleep this will immediately run again - is that desired?

Line:179, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_owner.cc -> Seems like this should only be called if we just created the timeout task at line 172.

Could we restructure this so we set the initial sleep time in the constructor - i.e.

    auto [itr, emplaced] =
        map.try_emplace(scan->getUuid(), std::move(scan));
        if (!timeoutTask) {
            timeoutTask = std::make_unique<EventDrivenTimeoutTask>(
                        std::make_shared<RangeScanTimeoutTask>(taskable, vb,
                       std::chrono::steady_clock::now() + maxScanDuration
        }

(While logically the map.size() should only be size==1 when we don't have a timeoutTask, and have just created one, it feels simpler / safer to make it explicit)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for review - let me know if change is still needed
Line:1358, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Next patch makes this and some other config dynamic

Line:134, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_owner.cc -> I was cloning the durability timeout (as per earlier review) which does the same http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/kv_engine/engines/ep/src/durability_timeout_task.cc?r=e0e5d5c9#97-108

Inside the "cancelRangeScanExceedingDuration" path we should be updating the sleep time of the task to match that of the next timeout

At the point that the RangeScanOwner goes to owning 0 scans, the task sleep is set to -1 (forever)

Line:179, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_owner.cc -> We don't destroy the timeoutTask in this setup, so with that change going from 0 to one again we'd skip waking up the task

Would that be more desirable to have it destroyed (at line 335 below) and then recreated each time we go the map flips from empty to !empty?

Line:1358, engines/ep/configuration.json -> 👍

Line:134, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_owner.cc -> Gotcha. 

I think it's worth a comment similar to the DurabilityTimeoutTask one, just to highlight that this /is/ slept elsewhere.

Line:179, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_owner.cc -> I was thinking for symmetry we should either create it every time the map goes from zero to non-zero (and delete when it hits zero items again), or create the task in the VBucket ctor and keep it around until the VBucket is destroyed.

I had a look at SyncWriteTimeouts and they essentially create a timeout task when a VBucket becomes actice (for the ADM).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:179, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_owner.cc -> Looking into this now, I didn't spot that ~EventDrivenTimeout issues a cancel - so will be nicer for an idle system to cancel all tasks
