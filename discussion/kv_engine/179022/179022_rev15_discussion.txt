DESCRIPTION:

[folly] Add support for TLS connections

Add support for using TLS for the folly connections in addition
to plain communications.

This currently utilize the SSLContext built from OpenSSL, and not
follys own API to build up the SSL Context (which would allow us
to switch to BoringSSL) due to the fact that it wasn't possible
to get our unit tests to work with the API it provides (for
instance you can't specify TLS 1.3 as the minimum version)
