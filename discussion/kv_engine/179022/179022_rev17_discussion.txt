DESCRIPTION:

[folly] Add support for TLS connections

Add support for using TLS for the folly connections in addition
to plain communications.

This currently utilize the SSLContext built from OpenSSL, and not
follys own API to build up the SSL Context (which would allow us
to switch to BoringSSL) due to the fact that it wasn't possible
to get our unit tests to work with the API it provides (for
instance you can't specify TLS 1.3 as the minimum version)

Line:401, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> Maybe add some context to this (i.e. "FollyCollection:") - given we might end up with zero-copy in disk IO paths also.

Line:415, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> Out of interest, how does Folly handle TLS renegotiation?

Line:401, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> (The context is already added as it is using the connection id prefix used by the core... (it is debug only; and will go away soon))

Line:415, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> I don't really know as I haven't tested it yet (we don't have a unit test which tries to do that).

We do set the flag that we _don't_ want renegotiation in the SSL context (and bufferevent handles it "correctly"). I'll do a manual test for now, but note that this patch isn't enabling the use of folly on our server; it just adds the bits needed to make it pass all of our unit tests... it would be extremely interesting to see the output of a perf run with high load and multiple clients etc.

Line:415, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> Thanks. I know we aren't enabling it by default, it just occurred to me if we have correct handling given the recent issues we saw in 6.x.

Line:415, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> We should solve that by setting minimum TLS version to 1.3 hehe.. After all its 4+ years old by now.... 

I'll try to run in manually (I was thinking of adding a unit test for it; just need to see how hard it is and if it is worth the effort..)

Line:415, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> Just tested it locally... It will disconnect the client and you'll see in the log:
