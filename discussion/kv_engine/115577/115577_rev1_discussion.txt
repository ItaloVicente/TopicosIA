DESCRIPTION:

Make checkpoint seqnos weakly monotonic

Seqnos in Checkpoints are currently not weakly monotonic as some
meta items are enqueued with lastBySeqno + 1 whilst others are not.
If we were to see a set_vbucket_state followed by a checkpoint_end
then we would see our seqno go back by 1.

Enqueue all meta items with lastBySeqno + 1 to make checkpoint seqnos
weakly monotonic.

Line:1184, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> This seems odd - logically I would have thought a checkpoint_end would have the same seqno as the last mutation in it. 

If we are making the checkpoint_end  range half-open (end is exclusive, not inclusive) then we should at least document this somewhere as to not confuse people.

Line:1184, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Sure, makes sense. I don't think we rely on the setVBState seqno anywhere (we use the cas) so this (new patch) seems to work and doesn't change the end seqno

Line:1184, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Turns out I was wrong, this doesn't work because now the setVBState will be enqueued with a seqno too low if it's the first thing.
