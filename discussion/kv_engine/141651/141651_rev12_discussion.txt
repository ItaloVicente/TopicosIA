DESCRIPTION:

MB-42795: Replace setup/reset context with switch execute env

The setup/reset context API was not sufficient for maintaining thread
context and magma is unable to support stackable contexts. By switching
to a new API that supports passing in the execution environment pointer,
we can implement execution guards that can provide stackable
environments.

A compactor thread picks up a compaction task and sets the execution
environment to the kvstore being compaction. During compaction, we need
to create and destroy sstables which require accessing the global
execution environment since we are utilizing the global fd cache.
The magma code path might have multiple calls to setup the global
execution environment requiring the environments to be stackable.

Example:

- setup execution environment to specific bucket via SetExecutionEnv
- global execution guard
- global execution guard
- destructor of 2nd global execution guard
  should set execution env to 1st exec env
- destructor of 1st global execution guard
  should set execution to starting exec env from setup
- reset back to original execution env

Note: A null ExecutionEnv is valid. It means we are using the global
execution env. This can happen with some tests which don't fully
implement a mock environment including a mock ep engine.

I think the issue here is nullptr overloading to define default environment. We can do a concrete env type (like the one in my previous comment) so that the API has more clarity and the ptr non-null check can be added in the Switch method.

I don’t think this works well. ObjectRegistry::onSwitchThread returns the ep engine ptr. We currently don’t look at that pointer or make any assumptions about that ptr. That ptr will either be ep engine or null. When we do an EnvGuard and get the return value from the SwitchEnv (which is wrapper to onSwitchThread) call, how will we know to set the enum to Default or UserDefined unless we check the pointer is null or not? Again, I really don’t see any value whatsoever as long as ObjectRegistry::onSwitchThread accepts a null ptr.  IMO... magma should have no knowledge of that pointer or ever look at it or make any assumptions about it. It's much clearer to pass in null for global and non-null for user defined and matches the logic of ObjectRegistry.

I want to attempt to bottom out on this problem. There are 2 uses of onSwitchThread which is what magma SwitchEnv calls.

Case 1 is the case everyone thinks about. This case is where we need to switch to a specific bucket to track memory to that bucket. In this case, we use to provide Set/Unset functions... Set=set to a specific non null context and Unset=go back to global state. Because of the need to support stack Guards, this isn't sufficient for magma. Also wasn't sufficient for kv since BucketAllocationGuards exist. 

Case 2 is using a Guard. This is identical to BucketAllocationGuard and NonBucketAllocationGaurd in objectregistry.cc. Regardless of which Guard we use, we save off the previous setting and return to that setting when the Guard falls out of scope. These use the same ObjectRegistry::onSwitchThread used in case 1. We know nothing about the pointer returned from onSwitchThread.

There are several possible solutions to handle both cases. We could have a Set/Unset function just for case 1 and guard functions that allow stackable calls for global and user defined guards. If we go this route, we probably need to change the BucketAllocation guards to return a unique_ptr.

We could do what we are suggesting today, which requires a single SwitchEnv function that maps to onSwitchThread and assume nullptr means global. Or we could enhance it a bit and add a GlobalPtr to the magma config (which in effect is nullptr) and Bucket Ptr for a specific bucket per magma instance. What we give up in this scenario (assuming Global is a nullptr), is the ability to check what kind of env ptr we should expect. 

A 3rd possibility is to create an Env Class which has ptr and enum (global userDefined). We would need to enhance the SwitchEnv function to pass back this class which is saved in the Guard Structures and it would have to translate from onSwitchThread to EnvClass.

There are probably even more solutions and variations.

IMO... we should keep this as simple as possible. A single SwitchEnv function that can be used for both cases. This makes the code identical to what kv has and someone from kv looking at magma would be familiar with the code and how it works.

I can't move forward until this is decided so if we could get to some consensus soon, that would be great.

Discussed briefly with Dave about the null-check problem. As Dave suggested, adding engine == non-null asserts in all magma-kvstore callbacks would be a good place perform validation.

@Dave, Shall we go ahead with the API in the current patch ?
We can add validations in a separate patch once the new env integration part in magma merged.

As long as we have _some_ checks that engine is non-null when performing work against a Bucket on a Magma backend thread, that's probably ok. If that's problematic inside Magma's own guards, we can add such Expects() to the various places Magma calls back into kv-engine (in magma-kvstore.cc) - such as (non-exhaustive list):

* MakeCompactionCallback
* MakeUserStats

In such cases, if ObjectRegistry::getCurrentEngine() returns non-null in the ctor, the lambda should perform an Expects that when that function is later called, ObjectRegistry::getCurrentEngine()has the same value.

That can be a follow-up patch if you prefer.
