DESCRIPTION:

MB-42795: Refactor magma config for thread context

In the old scheme of hiding the ep engine context in the setup routine,
we are unable to track back to the setup/reset functions easily and
lose context when utilizing magma threads for sstable flushing and
compaction. The new scheme will pass in a setup function that takes
a specific engine context to allow magma to implement stackable arena
and non arena guards.

An example of a arena / thread context sequence in magma:
A compactor thread picks up a compaction task and sets the context to
the kvstore being compacted. During compaction, we need to create and
remove sstables which require accessing the global fd cache. All
allocations to the global fd cache need to be accounted for outside of
bucket memory accounting. The code path in magma might encounter more
than 1 non arena guard. So the context might look like this...
- setup context to specific bucket
- non arena guard ... setup context to global memory arena
- non arena guard ... setup context to global memory arena
- destructor of 2nd non arena guard
- destructor of 1st non arena guard
- reset back to original arena

arena guard and non arena guard are RAII structures that change thread
context and when destructed, return the context back to its original
state.

A possible future enhancement would be to use the
je_mallctl(arenas.lookup) function during the free call to guarantee
memory accounting is done to the correct arena for the pointer being
freed. This would simplify code using smart pointers when the pointer is
freed as it falls out of scope.

This is checkin 1 of 2 for kv engine side. The 2nd check in will remove
the old magma configuration parameters for thread context.

Well, it's hard to give more specific details without knowing which specific tests are failing (and hence how those tests are setup, and if they should have an EPEngine instance or not). 

As per my previous comment, _if_ the test doesn't have an EPEngine instance you could simply modify MagmaKVStore's ctor to pass a different lambda for SetupThreadContext etc (or maybe not setup at all?) If no engine is associated with the current thread, given that means memory tracking isn't going to work anyway.
