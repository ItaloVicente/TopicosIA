DESCRIPTION:

MB-42795: Refactor magma config for thread context

In the old scheme of hiding the ep engine context in the setup routine,
we are unable to track back to the setup/reset functions easily and
lose context when utilizing magma threads for sstable flushing and
compaction. The new scheme will pass in a setup function that takes
a specific engine context to allow magma to implement stackable arena
and non arena guards.

This is checkin 1 of 2 for kv engine side. The 2nd check in will remove
the old magma configuration parameters for thread context.

Line:497, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> I mean within the lambda - i.e. SetupThreadContext should always be called with a non-null EPEngine* ptr or the memory-tracking will end up incorrect.

Line:497, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Isn't it possible that ep engine ptr could be nullptr? In fact, that's expected when we are doing non arena allocations.

Line:497, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Not if you're allocating to an actual bucket - I would expect ResetThreadCtx to be called if you're switching "away" from a bucket.

(Otherwise if you're calling SetupThreadCtx you don't actually actually need both SetupThreadCtx and ResetThreadCtx, you could just use SetupThreadCtx for both use-cases).

Line:497, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Sure, so if you want that API you don't need two functions to switch thread, one will suffice (given what you're saying about wanting to pass `nullptr` into SetupThreadCtx). In other words the ResetThreadCtx method is unnecessary in your API.

Line:497, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> (in other words, I believe you just need to wrap ObjectRegistry::onSwitchThread - something like:

 configuration.magmaCfg.SwitchThreadCtx = [](void* ctx) {
     auto* eng = static_cast<EventuallyPersistentEngine*>(ctx);
     return ObjectRegistry::onSwitchThread(eng, true);
 };

... and no need for ResetThreadCtx.

Line:497, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> We could remove Reset, but that assumes the Reset context is known to magma (ie. we know to pass in a nullptr). If Reset were to switch to something other than nullptr, not having Reset would mean magma would do something incorrect. By passing in both Setup/Reset and using the return from ptr from those calls, magma is completely and blissfully ignorant of any logic required to manage thread context.

So perhaps this is a naming problem then. I was assuming that Setup/Reset were symmetric - you'd be using Setup to switch into a bucket, then reset to leave.  However it sounds like that's not the case :-

a) Setup... is used to switch between different buckets (in a "stackable" manner)
b) Reset is used to finish working on any particular bucket

Is that the case?

I would suggest documenting the API usage in magma.h to make this clear for future readers - I suspect getting this 100% correct will be critical in accurate memory tracking.

Line:497, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> The typical usage is this...
Magma thread gets a compaction task and does a setup to the bucket owning that kvstore.
As part of that compaction, we create/destroy some sstables which hit the global fd cache and requires 1 or more non arena guard calls which are also setup calls.  
While this isn't the only pattern seen, its the most common and easiest to explain.
If thread context were limited to only tracking arena context, then I would say we should only need thread context for allocations and free's should determine arena accounting based on the arena tagged with the pointer. That's more in line with what I'm familiar with in a pool/arena based memory system. Not sure what perf impacts that might have.
