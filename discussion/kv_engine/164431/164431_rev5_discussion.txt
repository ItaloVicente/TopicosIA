Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

Is this going to cause any compatibility issues, given we previously supported either case - and it's possible one or more of our client libraries is sending in lowercase and has been "working" correctly so far...

Given the (potentially) large cost (a user's app simply stops working) and the small benefit (it's a small simplification to the code) I'm not convinced it's worth making this change.

That would be a violation of the RFC if the clients does so

Agreed - however given the clients are all "ours" (afiak), I could quite believe that we have clients
which violate the RFC - particulary given up until now we accepted either case (and our clients was likely never going to connect to any other server).

If we want to make this change I think we first need to audit all of our SDKs (and all supported versions) to check they all send the mechanism uppercase.
