DESCRIPTION:

MB-34997: Give the PDM the outstanding prepares during VB state change

The crash associated with the MB showed that when a VB switches from
active to replica, the new PDM must not be constructed with no state, it
should inherit any pending writes so that it can process them when the
new active generates commits against the pre-state change prepares.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:72, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.cc -> Nit: Would be nice if we could move this code which is common between the two ctors into a helper function.
