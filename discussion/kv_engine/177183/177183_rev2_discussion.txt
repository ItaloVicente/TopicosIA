DESCRIPTION:

MB-52633: Do not consider freq counters of items in replicas

Frequency counter values are not replicated and so do not reflect the
state of the active vBucket. Should the active failover and this
replica be promoted then the data that is resident is not neccessarily
the hottest data. It's simpler to just evict the first data we see for
replica vBuckets.
