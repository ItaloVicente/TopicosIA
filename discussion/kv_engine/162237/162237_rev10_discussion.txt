DESCRIPTION:

MB-48587: Introduce Checkpoint::queueMemOverhead

That accounts for the memory overhead of internal pointers of the
Checkpoint::toWrite container.

Purpose is replacing any usage of
MemoryTrackingAllocator::getBytesAllocated() for the container.
Multiple reasons for doing that:

1. Mem-tracking within the allocator breaks as soon as the splice() API
   is used on the container. That is an issue that has already been
   solved in the ItemExpel code-path at
   http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/161818. With this change
   we aim to solve the last part of the problem by removing the last
   existing call to toWrite.get_allocator().getBytesAllocated(), which
   is in Checkpoint::getMemoryOverhead().

2. At the time of writing, in MB-49134 we are observing abnormal
   spikes of Checkpoint::getMemoryOverhead(). (1) is only one component
   of the overhead quantity, so that might or might not be the
   component responsible for the spike. Regardless of that, and for the
   same reason of (1), I'm replacing all the components of
   Checkpoint::getMemoryOverhead() that rely on
   Allocator::getBytesAllocated() (eg, key-index), so this patch is just
   the first step.

Note that the new member type's MemoryCounter. Which means that with
this patch we start accounting the toWrite memory overhead into the
estimated CM mem usage at all levels (bucket, vbucekt/CM, checkpoint).
That makes the estimate more accurate.

So to summarize:
- This patch adds a new member that stores an estimation of the
  checkpoint mem overhead
- The new member will gives us the immediate improvement of getting a
  more accurate computation of the estimated overall CM mem usage
- In a follow-up patch the new member will be used (in conjunction with
  other existing Checkpoint members) for re-implementing
  Checkpoint::getMemoryOverhead()
