DESCRIPTION:

MB-48587: Introduce Checkpoint::queueMemOverhead

The new member accounts for the memory overhead of internal pointers of
the Checkpoint::toWrite container and it's manually computed.

Purpose is introducing a new CM overhead-estimate stats that is
consistent with the existing overall CM mem-usage, which is manually
computed too.
We already have a Checkpoint::keyIndexMemUsage, the new member is the
missing component for the total overhead.

Note that the new member type's MemoryCounter. Which means that with
this patch we start accounting the toWrite memory overhead into the
estimated CM mem usage at all levels (bucket, vbucekt/CM, checkpoint).
That makes the accounting for enforcing the CM Quota more accurate.

So to summarize:
- This patch adds a new member that stores an estimation of the mem
  overhead in the checkpoint queue
- The new member will gives us the immediate improvement of getting a
  more accurate computation of the estimated overall CM mem usage
- In a follow-up patch the new member will be used (in conjunction with
  other existing Checkpoint mem trackers) for adding new overhead stat
  that is consitent with the existing tracking for the CM Quota

Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> "estimation" - is it actually an estimate or not - I thought it was accurate now?

Line:24, /COMMIT_MSG -> As per offline discussion, I'm naming "estimate" all quantities that come from manually tracked counters.
That's for distinguishing from other stats that expose values from allocators.

I'm happy to review the whole naming things if that feels confusing.

Another approach would be renaming the stats from allocators (eg, getQueueAllocatorBytes()), and leaving the plain name (eg, getQueueBytes() for the manually tracked stuff.

I think this is better.

While I understand your desire to distinguish between the two types of stats; "estimate" in the name (to me) implies we _know_ there is some error bar there, and people looking at them might not trust them / assume is out by some value. 

While that might be the case if there's some bug in our manual tracking :), the same could be said for the allocator stats if we has a code bug there...
