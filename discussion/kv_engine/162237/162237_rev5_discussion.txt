DESCRIPTION:

MB-48587: Introduce Checkpoint::queueMemOverhead

That accounts for the memory overhead of the Checkpoint::toWritw
container. In a follow-up patch that will logically replace any usage of
MemoryTrackingAllocator for the container.

Also, the new member type's MemoryCounter. Which means that with this
patch we start accounting the toWrite memory overhead into the
estimated checkpoint memory usage at all levels (bucket, vbucekt/CM,
checkpoint). That makes the estimate more accurate.
