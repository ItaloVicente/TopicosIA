DESCRIPTION:

MB-48587: Introduce Checkpoint::queueMemOverhead

The new member accounts for the memory overhead of internal pointers of
the Checkpoint::toWrite container and it's manually computed.

Purpose is replacing the usage of
toWrite::get_allocator()::getBytesAllocated() in the computations of
the checkpoint's overhead.

The main reason for doing that is that currently all CM mem-usage
computations for enforcing the CMQuota is based on a manually-computed
estimate of the CM usage. Which is inconsistent with the current
overhead quantity.

Note that the new member type's MemoryCounter. Which means that with
this patch we start accounting the toWrite memory overhead into the
estimated CM mem usage at all levels (bucket, vbucekt/CM, checkpoint).
That makes the estimate more accurate.

So to summarize:
- This patch adds a new member that stores an estimation of the
  checkpoint mem overhead
- The new member will gives us the immediate improvement of getting a
  more accurate computation of the estimated overall CM mem usage
- In a follow-up patch the new member will be used (in conjunction with
  other existing Checkpoint mem trackers) for re-implementing
  Checkpoint::getMemoryOverhead() and making it consistent with the
  overall CM usage tracking.

Line:570, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Might be worth documenting why we cannot remove a checkpointMetaItem from a checkpoint.

Line:613, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> You could just ifdef it differently on Debug/Windows (as we do elsewhere), and add the correct value; then you can remove the "estimate" in the description.

Line:570, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Done

Line:613, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> So the "extra" on Win/Debug isn't per element, it's per container. So my comment is just unrelated here.
From our memory_tracking_allocator_test.cc:

#if WIN32
        // On windows for an empty list we still allocate space for
        // containing one element.
        extra = perElementOverhead;
#if _DEBUG
        // additional 16 bytes overhead in an empty list with Debug CRT.
        extra += 16;
#endif
#endif

So our "per element overhead" is correctly set to '3 * sizeof(uintptr_t)'.
Which is the actual overhead, so I'm keeping the constexpr as it is and fixing the comment.
Thanks
