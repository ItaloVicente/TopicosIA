Line:1060, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Would it be helpful to explicitly state bool here for the reader? At a glance `decompressed` _could_ be a decompressed item rather than a flag.
Not a big deal though, a glance at the method declaration would clear it up anyway 😊

Line:701, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Do we have mock spdlog log stuff? If not it's probably not worth digging in to just for this, but if it's already used somewhere else we could mock and check for a logged warning :shrug: might be a bit icky though.

Line:504, engines/ep/src/item.h -> I think a more verbose return status is needed - use of bool generally success/fail - so without this comment (i.e. reading a call-site) it's easy to think "removeBody" return true means the body was removed, false not - but we're actually returning something about the state of compression,

Suggest addition of a more explicit enum with Yes/No values and use that, e.g. "WasBodyInflated" Same for the other remove functions

Line:99, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/test_helpers.cc -> we do have tests that use multiple vbuckets - this change to makeCompressibItem means more work for anyone who wants to create an item for a different vb. Suggest you keep the parameter and change this function to set the vbucket on the new Item, similar to make_item

fix may break
Line:504, engines/ep/src/item.h -> Yeah, I like the enum, doing

Line:701, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Mmm I thought about a MockItem or using a hook.. and I've decided that they weren't worth for this kind of fix.
But actually yes, we do have a MockBucketLogger, let s see what I can do with that. Thanks for suggestion 👍

Line:99, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/test_helpers.cc -> Done
