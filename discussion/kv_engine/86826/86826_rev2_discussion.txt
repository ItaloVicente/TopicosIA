DESCRIPTION:

MB-27223: Don't reset NRU on an update

There has been a regression from 4.6.2 where on an update we reset the
NRU when an update is performed.  This patch reverts the regression and
adds a specific test for when an update is performed.

Argurably the NRU should be modified to reflect that the value is in
the working set.  However this improvement is not part of MB-27223.
