DESCRIPTION:

MB-38845: Handle as flush-failure all KVStore::commit failure codes

Specifically for Couchstore, in PersistenceCallback we are currently
handling commit-errors NO_HEADER, NO_SUCH_FILE and DOC_NOT_FOUND in the
flush-success code path.
Thus, we may and up with wrongly updating flush-stats at flush-failure.
Which may result in some NonNegativeCounter underflow when we succeed at
re-attempting the flush.
The above happens for both mutation and deletion. Both fixed in this
patch.

Specifically for deletion we fix also another issue. Wrongly executing
into the success-path means that we may remove the delete stored-value
from the HashTable, when the deletion has not been persisted yet.
At FullEviction that may cause the following scenario:
 - deletion inserted in the HT
 - deletion queued for persistence, but flush fails
 - deletion removed from the HT
 - frontend read does not find the deletion in the HT, so it bg-fecthes
   a previous alive doc (if any) from disk
