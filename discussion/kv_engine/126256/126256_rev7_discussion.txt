DESCRIPTION:

MB-38845: Handle as flush-failure all KVStore::commit failure codes

Specifically for Couchstore, in PersistenceCallback we are currently
handling commit-errors NO_HEADER, NO_SUCH_FILE and DOC_NOT_FOUND in the
flush-success code path.
Thus, we may and up with wrongly updating flush-stats at flush-failure.
Which may result in some NonNegativeCounter underflow when we succeed at
re-attempting the flush.
The above happens for both mutation and deletion. Both fixed in this
patch.

Specifically for deletion we fix also another issue. Wrongly executing
into the success-path means that we may remove the delete stored-value
from the HashTable, when the deletion has not been persisted yet.
At FullEviction that may cause the following scenario:
 - deletion inserted in the HT
 - deletion queued for persistence, but flush fails
 - deletion removed from the HT
 - frontend read does not find the deletion in the HT, so it bg-fecthes
   a previous alive doc (if any) from disk

I didn't look through anything other than the kvstore chagnes but looks you you should do the same to magma-kvstore.cc
Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> does alive mean not deleted in this case? The bg fetch can return deleted items

Oh for some reason I thought to do that in the merge of this patch to master, but this is actually the right place, doing.

Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> Correct.
So actually what the frontend sees depends on what it has opted-in, which could include deletes.
The point here is more on that at read you expect to see the latest seqno. In my example the latest seqno is a delete, but if you read from disk you may get a previous seqno as the delete has not been persisted.

Ahh I hadn't spotted the branch was mad-hatter!
Line:26, /COMMIT_MSG -> Ahh gotcha!

So I would prefer to do the magma changes here, but the magma code doesn't even build at CV at MH (EP_USE_MAGMA is OFF).
Deferring the magma to the merge as originally planned 👍
