DESCRIPTION:

MB-54452: Use boost::intrusive_list for Connection LRU

This avoids adding a custom doubly-linked list impl and just uses
boosts' instead. It is also cheaper to update, as we don't remove and
re-add the element in the list; we just use splice to rearrange the
list as appropriate.

This also flagged a bug where we were not inserting the Connection
into the list via one of the ctors.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Looks better. 

From a learning perspective it would be interesting to know how this is "memory-wise" the current implementation use two pointers per connection object, and by flipping to this the per-connection memory size dropped with 8 bytes (my guess is pointer to a "node" element (which probably contains a next, prev and value pointer).

Line:1226, daemon/connection.h -> not needed, only used once in front-end-thread.h

Line:97, daemon/front_end_thread.h -> tempted to refactor to make this protected and add with:

     onTouchConnection(Connection& conn);
     onDestroyConnection(Connection& conn);

and have the connection call those instead of touching the threads inner guts

Line:158, daemon/thread.cc -> nit: missing \n

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I suspect that's due to alignment - the list_base_hook is a simple struct with two elements - for example:

 image lookup --type Connection -v
Best match found in /Users/dave/repos/couchbase/server/neo/build-debug/kv_engine/memcached_testapp:
id = {0x18000aefc8}, name = "Connection", byte-size = 536, decl = connection.h:65, compiler_type = "class Connection : public DcpMessageProducersIface, public boost::intrusive::list_base_hook<> {
 ...
 
 (lldb) image lookup --type boost::intrusive::list_base_hook<> -v
Best match found in /Users/dave/repos/couchbase/server/neo/build-debug/kv_engine/memcached_testapp:
id = {0x18000b21f4}, name = "list_base_hook<>", qualified = "boost::intrusive::list_base_hook<>", byte-size = 16, decl = list_hook.hpp:84, compiler_type = "template<> class list_base_hook<<>> : public boost::intrusive::make_list_base_hook<>::type {
 
i.e. the boost hook is also 16 bytes in size. 

I don't have this compiled on Linux right now, where gdb's parole command would probably be more informative in showing the layout.
Line:1226, daemon/connection.h -> Done

Line:97, daemon/front_end_thread.h -> There's also an "auto-unhook" mode of boost::intrusive which removes an item from it's list automatically when destructed. Given we have some connections in the list and some not (i.e. system connections), auto-unlink is probably fine for our use-case here?

Line:158, daemon/thread.cc -> Done

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I need to focus on a customer CBSE today so feel free to refactor as per your suggestion if you want.
