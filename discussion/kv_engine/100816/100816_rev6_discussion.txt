DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Get rid of State::parse_cmd

As part of trying to simplify the state transition diagram
(to prepare for OOO) we parse the header once we have the
entire header in place in the read_packet_header state
before we'll transition to either execute, close or read
the packet body if it isn't available.
