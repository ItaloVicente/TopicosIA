DESCRIPTION:

MB-36948: Add vbucket_state::maxVisibleSeqno

Add a new seqno stored in the persisted vbucket state that tracks the
seqno of the most recent committed (via prepare or mutation) value.

This seqno will be used as the snapshot end when backfilling from disk
for a connection which is not sync-write aware.
