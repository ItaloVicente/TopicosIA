DESCRIPTION:

Remove dependencies to the engines from memcached_testapp

memcached_testapp is linked with memcached_daemon which now
links with all of the engines so the dependencies is already
present.

(we need the dependendency to memcached as memcached_testapp
spawns memcached as a separate process in the test cases so
it needs to be linked before memcached_testapp may be used)
