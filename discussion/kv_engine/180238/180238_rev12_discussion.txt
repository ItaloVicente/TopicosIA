DESCRIPTION:

MB-53597: Add task group for all tasks of all taskables

We currently do not gather stats for the NoBucket taskable but we are
adding more tasks to it for the cross-Bucket memory sharing work. These
stats may be useful in the future, so add an additional stat group that
gathers stats from all Ready Buckets (we cannot touch non-Ready Buckets
easily) and the NoBucket taskable for later use in cbcollect_info.

Line:593, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> I believe this call will cause TSAN to barf out as it isn't atomic (and only intended for unit tests. Checking the type == BucketType::ClusterConfigOnly is what we do elsewhere.

So why would TSAN barf? we allow for "in bucket upgrade" going from ClusterConfigOnly to a full Couchbase bucket which means that we've got two path:

    Unknown -> Couchbase -> Unknown
    Unknown -> ClusterConfigOnly -> Couchbase -> Unknown
    
We access the engine parameter without any locks as that would cause a contention, and we only let a connection bound to a ClusterConfigOnly bucket perform a really small subset of commands: https://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/kv_engine/daemon/cookie.cc?r=741d2848#557-575 and those commands can never touch the engine parameter. Once the engine gets created in the other thread it initialize the engine member; it grabs the bucket mutex creating a full barrier; and change the bucket type.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:593, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> I guess it should have a better name, but the docs does state it O:)

    /// Does this bucket have an engine or not (for unit tests)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:593, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> It should probably be given a name more fitting for something that is only "usable" in unit tests, to prevent the next person from accidentally thinking that it's okay to use, rather than relying on review comments. TSan doesn't barf because tests don't cover any concurrency here.

I'm now checking the bucket type before using it.

Line:593, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> I know :) Didn't check it because what it does seemed simple enough from the name ;)
