DESCRIPTION:

MB-53597: Add task group for all tasks of all taskables

We currently do not gather stats for the NoBucket taskable but we are
adding more tasks to it for the cross-Bucket memory sharing work. These
stats may be useful in the future, so add an additional stat group that
gathers stats from all Ready Buckets (we cannot touch non-Ready Buckets
easily) and the NoBucket taskable for later use in cbcollect_info.
