DESCRIPTION:

MB-48531: EPStats::estimatedCheckpointMemUsage tracks only mem in CM

That is a pre-requirement for allowing multiple concurrent
CheckpointRemover tasks and let them use global EPStats as
synchronization point. Note that CheckpointRemover(s) need to synch for
avoiding to drop too many DCP cursor.

Line:756, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Is this correct? What about if a MemoryCounter is destroyed and the Checkpoint has a valid parent? Should this code be instead moved under the if() statement above?

Line:90, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> Suggest we rename this to something referring to "manager" - e.g. "checkpointManagerEstimatedMemUsage"

Line:756, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Think it will be okay - if the checkpoint has not been detached at the time it is destroyed, ~Checkpoint will detach it, calling the fetch subs in detachFromManager.

Though that does leave this a little non-obvious as to why ~MemoryCounter doesn't update it when all the other methods do.

Perhaps it would be nice to have some kind of "cascading" update - this memory counter updates its parent, and the parent _may_ update EPStats - that way when the parent is changed, it changes if/which stat in epstat this is linked to (but that might be a bit invasive).

Yes with regard to your concern, as per James comment.

About the rest, the MemoryCounter class was originally designed for that nice "cascading" update but now the problem is the changeParent() bit.

Essentially we need some logic that ensures that at destruction the EPStats::stat is update only if it wasn't previously updated (eg, by a move to the Destroyer). That is exactly the manual logic that has been introduce with detachFromManager(), so I m reusing it.

Line:90, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> Ack

Line:756, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> One thing that I've missed: the changeParent() API is too generic for us to use in this case, because we need to know exactly what's the old/new parents. Essentially that's the 'if(manager) {<decrement manager stats>}' bit that is already in Checkpoint::dtor that I m resuing.

> Though that does leave this a little non-obvious as to why ~MemoryCounter doesn't update it when all the other methods do.

True - actually I put the comment in place of that line, disappeared for unknown reason - you'll find a comment back within the next patchset
