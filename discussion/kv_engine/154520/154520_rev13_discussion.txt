DESCRIPTION:

MB-46604: Start migration to folly executor pool in the core [1/5]

Use folly::CPUExecutor pool for bucket creation/deletion,
rbac and sasl file reload. This is a step on the way to get
off the homegrown executor service. At the end we want to use
a common pool with the engine tasks.

Patch Set 13: Code-Review-1

This is a pretty large match (over 1500 lines changed) - much of that is the refactoring of the bucket functions into the BucketManager. Could you split this in half; with the refactor into bucketManager first (given that's mostly just code moving from one file to another)?
Line:219, daemon/buckets.h -> Please add a comment describing this class.

Line:46, daemon/protocol/mcbp/create_remove_bucket_command_context.cc -> I don't think we want to use the raw "add()" method on the executor long-term, as that bypasses the higher-level abstractions (task tracking, stats, etc) we have for all the other tasks. 

As part of this sequence of patches it would be good to move FollyExecutorPool into say executors/, using a similar GlobalTask API we have currently so all tasks are handled in a similar way - for example `cbstats tasks` would then show and record stats for bucket creation / deletion which we know has been slow in the past.

Line:219, daemon/buckets.h -> Ok.. (personally I think that the name of the class and metods would be pretty self-documenting...)

Line:46, daemon/protocol/mcbp/create_remove_bucket_command_context.cc -> That is the long-term goal, and this is the first step to just move off the homegrown executor, then the plan was to move the executor from ep-engine and flip this code over to using the tasks.

It is however a bit more work to move the executor from ep-engine to fix up:

a) its use of the ep-logger
b) the memory tracker

So the plan was to first get rid of all "duplicate names".. then move the executor to its own lib, and finally move these tasks over to use that framework
