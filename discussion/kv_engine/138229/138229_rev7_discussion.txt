DESCRIPTION:

MB-41550: Allow SubdocReplaceBodyWithXattr to revive documents

Allow SubdocReplaceBodyWithXattr to operate on deleted documents,
but given that a deleted document can't have a value (only XATTRs)
we also introduce a new flag called ReviveDocument.

The primary motivation for creating a new flag and not just have
SubdocReplaceBodyWithXattr automatically revive a deleted document
is to make sure that it behaves the same way as the other subdoc
operations on deleted documents (in case we ever want to allow
deleted documents to contain value in the future).

Unfortunately we can't do CAS replace when transitioning from a
deleted document to a live document (ep-engine don't support that).
The way the commit phase for transactions work today is currently
that they try to run an Add from the client SDK field (which would
fail if someone had created the document in the mean time). That
is a potential problem that it won't detect if someone creates
and then deletes the document in the time gap from the staging
to the commit. Hopefully we can close the gap by implementing a
cas replace of a document from the Deleted state to Alive.

Line:433, daemon/subdocument_validators.cc -> Not sure this is correct.

IIRC, "AccessDeleted" allow access to a deleted _or_ alive document; either state will succeed. As such, if the document is currently Alive, then it should be possible to use SubdocReplaceBodyWithXattr and not specify ReviveDocument.

(If the document is deleted then yes, the request would fail but not until we attempt to execute it).

Line:433, daemon/subdocument_validators.cc -> Another way to look at this is this operation will never succeed if AccessDeleted is provided and you actually get a deleted document. If you _DON'T_ specify AccessDeleted you're guaranteed that you'll always get a live document and it'll work...

In the current usage the client knows that they created the staging document as a deleted document, and thats the document they'll want to "promote" so they must specify ReviveDocument). In the oposite case it knows that it didn't create the staging document as a deleted document so it shouldn't use Access Deleted.

I can always remove the test here and it'll error out at a later stage ( http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/cheshire-cat/kv_engine/engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc#2603-2615 ) with Einval without an error context, but the problem is logged. To me it seemed to be better to just save the CPU cycles and don't even try to search for the document as the caller _SHOULD_ know if it was deleted or not...

Line:433, daemon/subdocument_validators.cc -> Note that AccessDeleted is also used by SyncGateway IIRC.

In the general case, a client _could_ make a request with AccessDeleted, and not know ahead of time if the document is alive or deleted (I'm not sure if SyncGW / Transactions _does_ do this today, but they could). 

As an example: A client only wants to replace the body with an XATTR iff the document is alive and doesn't have a tombstone (if is has a tombstone they want it to fail). 

By specifying ReplaceBodyWithXAttr+AccessDeleted (and without ReviveDocument) they can get that semantic.

Line:433, daemon/subdocument_validators.cc -> Ok, I'll delay the response and add a unique error for that (as it currently stands you'll get EINVAL no matter what so its hard to differentiate)
