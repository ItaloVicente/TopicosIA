DESCRIPTION:

MB-32886 [SR]: Replica acks disk-seqno

For meeting the consistency requirements at failure scenario (details
in DesignDoc) it is sufficient that a Replica ack's the local
persisted-seqno /after/ the flusher has committed a flush-batch.

Note that this change enables Level::PersistToMajority.

Line:427, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> Not sure this is correct - i.e. consider a mad-hatter consumer connected to a <6.5 producer - it does not understand the seqno_ack message.

Line:427, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> You're right.
Note that today (at couchbase/master) a Consumer always performs the SyncRepl negotiation (regardless of the Producer version), which is itself wrong.
That said, it sounds like we need to do something similar to what we have done for NOOP:


ENGINE_ERROR_CODE DcpConsumer::handleNoop(struct dcp_message_producers* producers) {

    ..

    if (pendingSendNoopInterval) {
        ENGINE_ERROR_CODE ret;
        uint32_t opaque = ++opaqueCounter;

        // MB-29441: Set the noop-interval on the producer:
        //     - dcpNoopTxInterval, if the producer is a >=5.0.0 node
        //     - 180 seconds, if the producer is a pre-5.0.0 node
        //         (this is the expected value on a pre-5.0.0 producer)
        auto intervalCount =
                producerIsVersion5orHigher ? dcpNoopTxInterval.count() : 180;
        std::string interval = std::to_string(intervalCount);
        ret = producers->control(opaque, noopIntervalCtrlMsg, interval);
        pendingSendNoopInterval = false;
        return ret;
    }

    ..
}
