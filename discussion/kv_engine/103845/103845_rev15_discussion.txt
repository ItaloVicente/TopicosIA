DESCRIPTION:

MB-32886 [SR]: Replica acks disk-seqno

For meeting the consistency requirements at failure scenario (details
in DesignDoc) it is sufficient that a Replica ack's the local
persisted-seqno /after/ the flusher has committed a flush-batch.

Note that this change enables Level::PersistToMajority.

Line:1336, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> This doesn't immediately seem related to the SyncRepl changes - could you elaborate on why this is needed?

Line:424, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcpconnmap.cc -> This isn't the case if we are in a mixed-version cluster (say during upgrade).

We should only send the seqno_ack if the producer supports it.

Line:105, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Useful to explain when this could be thrown.

Line:371, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> This clause isn't really necessary - given pendingSyncWrite is just a local (non-atomic) variable there's no harm in re-writing it each time.

Line:477, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Is the state guaranteed to not change here? Do we have the correct mutex held?

Line:2991, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Without taking the stateLock I don't believe this is safe.

Line:2991, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Here and in other couple of places: it is /not/ safe, I forgot to acquire the VBucket::stateLock (like correctly done in the DurabilityTimeoutTask).
Unfortunately simple-test cannot spot this, as it doesn't issue any SyncWrite.
Fixing.

Line:2991, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> If you're feeling "correct", we could actually hide the state behind a lockState() method which returns a pair of (unique_lock, state) - meaning it's impossible to access without taking the lock...

... or we could just get Folly working and use its Synchronized API :) https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/docs/Synchronized.md

Line:2991, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> That's nice!
While I would like to implement a custom lockState(), probably better to spend time on getting Folly working and refactoring this for having a Synchronized<State>, given that the Folly solution is exactly what we need.
Also, IIRC we have some similar custom implementation within Collections that could be replaced by folly::Synchronized as well.
So, for now fixing this using the old-style locking and deferring that for a refactor.
