DESCRIPTION:

MB-32886 [SR]: Replica acks disk-seqno

For meeting the consistency requirements at failure scenario (details
in DesignDoc) it is sufficient that a Replica ack's the local
persisted-seqno /after/ the flusher has committed a flush-batch.

Note that this change enables Level::PersistToMajority.
