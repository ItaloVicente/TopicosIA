Line:156, engines/ep/src/bucket_quota_change_task.h -> percentages or quotas is more accurate than saying that they are reset to their original "values"

Line:157, engines/ep/src/bucket_quota_change_task.h -> Mixing declaration and definition into one statement - https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#c7-dont-define-a-class-or-enum-and-declare-a-variable-of-its-type-in-the-same-statement

Line:157, engines/ep/src/bucket_quota_change_task.h -> The linked guideline suggests against defining a type and another entity in the same statement. Technically, this is an anonymous struct, which the guidelines don't seem to mention 😕

Line:157, engines/ep/src/bucket_quota_change_task.h -> Hmm, this comment suggests that it is unnamed rather than anonymous, but I suppose you're right that this isn't technically defining a type.

Happy for somebody else to approve this, but think that the comment above still needs correcting

Line:157, engines/ep/src/bucket_quota_change_task.h -> It gets awkward to refer to anonymous structs (e.g. tests etc) - and while it might not need a name now it's probably better to give it one.

It also makes debugging easier - gdb et al can generate a sensible name for the struct.

Suggest name as "MemoryWatermark", give it two members "low" and "high" and then I think you get the best of both worlds - we have removed the repetition of "Watermark" in the member names ;)

Line:156, engines/ep/src/bucket_quota_change_task.h -> I m adding other members here, sure checkpoint lower/upper which are ratios.
So we'll have percentages, ratios, maybe also quotas.. So I need to use a generic term for them all

Line:157, engines/ep/src/bucket_quota_change_task.h -> That refers to named structs/classes, while this is a simple unnamed struct. There's no really need to name a type here.

Happy to give it a name if that helps people at debugging :)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:156, engines/ep/src/bucket_quota_change_task.h -> > If we were storing the ratios instead here then that would make sense, but we store the actual value as far as I can recall.

Indeed

        previousState.lowWatermark = engine->getEpStats().mem_low_wat;
        previousState.highWatermark = engine->getEpStats().mem_high_wat;
        
Abs values, I've read that as if it was 

    std::atomic<double> mem_low_wat_percent;
    std::atomic<double> mem_high_wat_percent;
    
Given that, then yes my description is incorrect. I ll fix

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:156, engines/ep/src/bucket_quota_change_task.h -> Perhaps you could replace with "original percentages/ratios" then? Reading "re-set to the original values" is misleading to me, implying that we reset the values to the pre change value (which would be very incorrect). If we were storing the ratios instead here then that would make sense, but we store the actual value as far as I can recall.
