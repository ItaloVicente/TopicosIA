DESCRIPTION:

MB-24363 Add ewouldblock functionality to trace dump chunk generation

Prior to this patch trace dump chunks were generated on a front-end
thread which would potentially block the thread while a multi-megabyte
string was being generated.

This patch switches to the chunks being generated on an executor
thread instead and adds ewouldblock handling to ioctl in general
to allow this to happen.

Line:1052, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> Given that you log the response you should probably log the request as well?

Line:1081, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> not really needed

Line:212, daemon/tracing.cc -> not used anymore

Line:222, daemon/tracing.cc -> Why are we changing value?

Line:1052, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> This is just copy and pasted from the SteppableCommandContext code, I'll just remove it since there's no easy way of running `logCommand` just once in this context.

Line:1081, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> Again, just the power of ctrl+c and ctrl+v

https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/4aebe09b27349eab76f18832f61760d9b326c2d3/daemon/protocol/mcbp/steppable_command_context.cc#L63

Line:212, daemon/tracing.cc -> It is still used on line 227.

Line:222, daemon/tracing.cc -> It's possibly not strictly necessary but I feel from a readability perspective it makes sense to say "the value returned is empty".

Line:1052, daemon/mcbp_executors.cc -> They log the command in the constructor at http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/kv_engine/daemon/protocol/mcbp/steppable_command_context.cc#23

Line:212, daemon/tracing.cc -> ah there it is.. I couldn't see it first ;)

Line:222, daemon/tracing.cc -> Ok. I'm used to that you can't really trust any of the "out parameters" in a function which fails.
