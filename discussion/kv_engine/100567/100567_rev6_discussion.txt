DESCRIPTION:

Use folly::Synchronized for VBucket::Backfill

Use Folly's Synchronised<>[1] concurrency wrapper for
VBucket::backfill. This removes the manual (and potentially
error-prone) locking / unlocking Backfill, instead using Synchronised,
which has a number of safely advantages - from the documentation:

* The data and the mutex protecting it are inextricably encapsulated
  together.

* If you tried to use <backfill> without acquiring the lock you
  wouldn't be able to; it is virtually impossible to access the queue
  without acquiring the correct lock.

* The lock is released immediately after the given operation is
  performed, and is not held for operations that do not need it.

In this case (I believe) the locking of VBucket::backfill was correct;
however we can now take advantage of the sharedMutex and hence avoid
blocking other readers with each other.

We should consider expanding this pattern to other similar places
(Manifest::CachingReadHandle?)
