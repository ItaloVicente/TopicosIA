DESCRIPTION:

MB-52153: Allow for using Argon2id 1.3 [1/3]

With the support for the new hash mechanism the
file format changed (see CBSASL.md for details), but
from a 1000ft it looks like:

 * New toplevel attribute named @@version@@ which
   should have the value 2
 * The "users" array and "n" field in each object
   was replaced by having the username be the
   attribute and the properties being the value.

This patch contains backwards compatibility with the
previous format so that it is still able to read
those files.

Patch 2/3 will change the content of the scram-sha
attributes to include server-key and stored-key
as needed in MB-52422.

Patch 3/3 will remove the backwards compatibility
once ns_server starts providing the new information.
