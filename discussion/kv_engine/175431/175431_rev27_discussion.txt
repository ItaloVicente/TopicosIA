DESCRIPTION:

MB-52153: Allow for using Argon2id 1.3

With the support for the new hash mechanism the
file format changed (see CBSASL.md for details), but
from a 1000ft it looks like:

 * New toplevel attribute named @@version@@ which
   should have the value 2
 * The "users" array and "n" field in each object
   was replaced by having the username be the
   attribute and the properties being the value.

This patch contains backwards compatibility with the
previous format so that it is still able to read
those files.

Line:47, cbsasl/password_database_test.cc -> could also be formatted as

 try {
     doThing();
     FAIL() << "thing didn't throw!";
 } catch {...}

As you've done in some of the other tests, but it's not a big difference 😊

nit Unknonw -> Unknown

Line:124, include/cbsasl/user.h -> When they add support for V1 or V2?

Line:47, cbsasl/password_database_test.cc -> The motivation for doing it this way is that the FAIL thing will mark the code as not covered when running under code coverage..

Line:124, include/cbsasl/user.h -> You're right, but I've got a patch in gerrit which nukes the comment and code (https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/175942 ) and I don't feel like rerunning CV on all of these patches just to fixup something which is to be deleted anyway?
