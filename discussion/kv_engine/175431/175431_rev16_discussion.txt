DESCRIPTION:

MB-52153: Allow for using Argon2id 1.3

Add support for a new entry in cbsasl.pw:

     "hash": {
         "a": "argon2id",
         "h": "base64 encoded hash of the password",
         "m": memory-cost,
         "p": parallel-cost,
         "s": "base64 encoded salt",
         "t": time-cost
     },

If found SASL will try to use this entry instead of
the entry stored under "plain" when performing SASL
authentication using the PLAIN mechanism.
