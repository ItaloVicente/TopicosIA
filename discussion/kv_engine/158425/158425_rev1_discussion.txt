DESCRIPTION:

MB-36377: Have KVStore::commit() consume the TransactionContext

The TransactionContext shouldn't be used after KVStore::commit() is
called. This will allow us in a future patch to guard against the
concurrent flushing of the same vBucket to a given KVStore by having
~TransactionContext reset appropriate KVStore state.
