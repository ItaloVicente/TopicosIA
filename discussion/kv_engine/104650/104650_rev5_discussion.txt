DESCRIPTION:

MB-32807 [SR]: Obey ns_server topology

With this patch we switch on Multiple-Replicas for Durability. One
main change here:

- We remove any hard-coded node name in ReplicationChain. So now a
  chain can be set only by ns_server through set-vbucket-state.

Note this patch is dependent on the ns_server changes under MB-32880
to be able to perform SyncWrites for a full-stack (cluster_run).
