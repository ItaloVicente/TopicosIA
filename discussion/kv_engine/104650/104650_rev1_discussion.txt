DESCRIPTION:

MB-32807 [SR]: Enable Multiple-Replicas

With this patch we switch on Multiple-Replicas for Durability.
One main change here:

1) We remove any hard-coded node name in ReplicationChain. So now a
chain can be set only by ns_server through set-vbucket-state.

Change-Id: I7c9902ba7970cd82353d762a7e0f693f9cc377ea
