DESCRIPTION:

MB-44167: Notify durable op clients when collection dropped

When we drop a collection we remove the elements in the DM belonging
to that collection. Currently we don't notify the clients which can
hang a shutdown. Notify the clients when we remove a SyncWrite from
the ADM. The PDM shouldn't need notifications as nothing should be
waiting for a replica to commit something.
