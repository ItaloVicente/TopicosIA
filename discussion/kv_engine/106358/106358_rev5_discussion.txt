DESCRIPTION:

MB-33186: Warmup: Add new 'loadPreparedSyncWrites' state

Add a new state to the Warmup process - State::LoadPreparedSyncWrites.

This state occurs early in the warmup process, before the normal bulk
key/value loading phases. It loads from disk all prepared SyncWrites
which were previously persisted, but not /yet/ committed to disk (at
which point the prepared SyncWrite would have been deleted and
replaced with a Committed one).

This patch adds all found prepared SyncWrites are into the
HashTable. Subsequent patches will also add them into the
DurablityMonitor.
