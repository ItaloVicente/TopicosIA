DESCRIPTION:

MB-32589: AddStatsStream: Correctly account allocated mem to NonBucket

AddStatsStream simplifies the calling of the ADD_STAT call when
building a stream of output. However the underlying ADD_STAT callback
can allocate memory which is *not* freed in the ep-engine context -
it's freed by Connection::releaseTempAlloc() inside the daemon.

Therefore it is incorrect to account any memory allocated via ADD_STAT
to the current ep-engine instance - which is what currently happens
when using AddStatsStream. The effect of this is that the mem_used of
a bucket will incorrectly grow everytime AddStatsStream is used. As a
consequence the mis-accounted memory is essentally stolen from the
bucket quota - that amount of memory is no longer available to the
bucket.

There are currently two uses of AddStatsStream - the undocumented stat
groups '_checkpoint-dump' and '_hash-dump' - both of which require
Privilege::Stats (and not just Privilege::SimpleStats). The lowest
Security Role which grants this privilege is `Read-Only Admin`. As
such while the severity of this is high, the liklihood of users
encountering this is expected to be low.

Fix the issue by using a NonBucketAllocationGuard to not include any
memory allocated via ADD_STAT in ~AddStatsStream.
