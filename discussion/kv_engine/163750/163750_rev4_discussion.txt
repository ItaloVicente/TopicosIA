DESCRIPTION:

MB-48467: Add config for magma MinCheckpointCreationInterval

During data load, checkpoint creation gets very
agressive due to the data size being small and checkpoint
threashold being 2%. MinCheckpointCreationInterval will
limit checkpoint creation to a more reasonable rate.

Also set it to zero for tests which require creation of
a checkpoint every batch.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> 2% of what?

Also, is this the right solution? Seems to me that this (2%) limit aggresively limits our ability to roll back. I was generally under the impression that the checkpoint interval and max checkpoint config params governed the time window of roll backs

Line:71, engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore_config.cc -> should we (or magma)n validate that this is lower than the normal checkpoint interval?

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> It is 2% of total data size per checkpoint so a max overhead of 10% of the datasize(5 checkpoints in queue), this can be changed via magma_checkpoint_threshold in configuration.json. This was added around a year ago cos the checkpointing overhead was causing magma to exceed the 2X disk to data size ratio mentioned in the PRD during overwrite workloads on faster SSDs.

It causes issues only when the datasize is small which usually occurs during data load. In those cases we assumed rollback to zero would be ok.

Line:71, engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore_config.cc -> I did not think of this. Will add some validation in magma. We have a function to validate the config on magma::Open.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Sounds fine to me. "checkpoint threshold" doesn't feel like a great name so could you just tidy up the commit message a little to make it clear that the 2% is 2% of the total data size

Line:71, engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore_config.cc -> Validation changes added here - http://review.couchbase.org/c/magma/+/163767
