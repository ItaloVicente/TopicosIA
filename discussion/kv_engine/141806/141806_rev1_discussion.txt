DESCRIPTION:

MB-42608: HTCleaner removes Completed Prepares unconditionally

Current behaviour is that we remove them only if the time when they have
been set Completed is older than HTCleaner::purgeAge. Essentially we are
applying the same logic that we apply to tombstones, but with no reason.
This patch fixes that.

Line:56, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> For committed items I think it's fine, but I'm worried about how we will stream aborts to replicas. I think that we could have the following scenario:

1) Replica connects
2) Active gets prepare and streams to replica
3) Replica receives prepare then stream disconnects for some reason
4) Active aborts prepare
5) Active sets completed (aborted) prepare to stale
6) Active purges the stale completed (aborted) prepare
7) Active accepts another write (so abort is not the last thing in seqlist)
8) Replica reconnects and does a seqlist backfill
9) Replica streams entire seqlist backfill and sees no completion for the prepare
10) Replica fails at next in memory streaming commit/abort as there is an incomplete prepare in trackedWrites

I thought that we had some test for this but I can't find one. I modified the BackfillAbort test slightly and it looks like an issue to me

Line:56, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> Thanks for raising the issue.
I assume that at/before step (9) Active responds with a rollback when Replica reconnects?
Surely what you describe must be checked, but my expectation is that Replica will rollback to 0 before streaming the entire seqlist.

Line:56, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> Ahh yes, forgot that the purge seqno should force a rollback at 8/9. That raises another issue though, doing this effectively makes the purge age/interval far shorter if you're doing SyncWrites.

Line:56, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> So I agree with Ben here - the point of using the completed time to determine when to purge is to ensure that a DCP client can successfully resume from where they left off within the metadata purge interval.

Line:56, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_tombstone_purger.cc -> That's true - But note that the default ephemeral_metadata_purge_age is 60secs, which means that a single (normal) update/delete every 60secs will trigger a Replica rollback to 0 anyway in your scenario.
I guess that pure-insert workloads are quite rare, so I don't expect this patch to make any relevant impact.
Also note that the same applies to Committed prepares, as they follow the same stale/purge logic in Ephe (at least for now).

Notes:
Logically, before this patch Ephemeral and Persistent behave the same. Ie, Abort is a delete on disk, so it is purged at compaction by the usual metadata-purge logic for tombstones. With regard to that I would say that keeping things as they are at Ephe is nicely consistent compared to how we behave for Persistent bucket.
On the other side, this patch brings an improvement on how we exploit available memory at Ephe. Technically this is a "mem-usage optimization". What we trade is a higher likelyhood of rollback, but that shouldn't change to mych if my consideration above are correct.

@daver, your opinion in this?
1) We leave things as they are, I ll just add some comments explaining why we do what we do
2) We merge this patch. Committed and Aborted prepares will be purged immediately when the HT cleaner runs. Side effect is the impact on rollback described above. My opinion is that this patch doesn't worsen things to much if we consider how ephemeral_metadata_purge_age behaves already (see above).

I think the default interval set by ns_server is actually 1 hour, but irrespective of the default, a user could change it and we should behave correctly.

As per my initial comment, I think we need to stick with (1), otherwise we are breaking the metadata purge interval contract.
From a memory optimization pov, yes SyncWrites impose a cost; but it's essentially the same cost that Deletes (either explicit or TTL-expiry) have under ephemeral, and we already give users a mechanism to choose how memory should be used - i.e. the metadata purge interval.
