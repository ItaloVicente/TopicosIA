DESCRIPTION:

 MB-38107: Minor optimisation on nextQueuedItem

Profiling a DGM index (view) generation showed
`ActiveStream::backfillPhase` as being 'hot' 1 to 2% of samples (with
most of that time being in nextQueuedItem).

Looking at the generated code two things were noted:

1) The producer shared_ptr is obtained twice, once in backfillPhase
and then inside nextQueuedItem
2) nextQueuedItem writes lastSentSeqno and mfences, which appears
unnecessary as the member itself is not a serialisation point and
all uses of it (except for stats) are done within streamMutex

This leads to a version of nextQueuedItem which is used by
backfillPhase that reduces the producer weak_ptr lock to one
and removes the need to re-read the state for in-memory/backfill
stat counting.

lastSentSeqno can be written with release semantics.

Some final tweaks were noted in that the backfillReceived can
shorten it's streamMutex scope by incrementing the atomic
bufferedBackfill counters outside of the lock, and those counters
can be relaxed atomic (they are only for stats).

Note that a toy-build with these changes didn't have any notable affect
on the regression tracked by the MB, but objdump shows a much tighter
function for the backfill variation of nextQueuedItem.
