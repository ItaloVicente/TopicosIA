Could you split this change in two? the "deamon" changes is unrelated to the changes done in engine (which is what the full description of the change describes)

Patch Set 2:

Problem is they're actually related, even if they don't seem like it. TimingHistogram::add() method in daemon is what caused the cascade of changes in ep_engine. GenericBlockTimer calls the add() method.
They have to be merged at the same time, together with patches [7-b] and [7-c].

I could update the commit description if you feel like it's misleading.

It sounds a bit strange to me that code located in daemon/ would be called directly from the engines.. If that's the case we should probably consider refactoring the class out to a separate library  :)
