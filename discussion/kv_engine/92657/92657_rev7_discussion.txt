DESCRIPTION:

MB-28615: SCRAM-SHA should not reveal that user doesn't exist

An "attacker" could use SCRAM-SHA and inspect the salt reported
back for a user to determine if a user exists in our system or
not. To get away from that ns_server provides memcached with
a "base salt" to use if the user doesn't exist, then memcached
can generate the actual salt by doing:

    hmac(sha(x), UserName, scramsha_fallback_salt)

This gives a "unique" salt on a per-user base, and a malicious
attacker can't try to connect to memcached to get the salt
and then compare it with the one reported by any other module
in couchbase.
