DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Make CM::getMemoryOverhead O(1)

@todo: Needs more work for fixing some tests. Deferring for now, not
high priority as all any other O(N) stats code (unless used in some hot
path).

We avoid to scan the entire checkpoint list for computing the value.
For doing that, we need to track the mem overhead in Checkpoint and
update a CM level counter.

Note: We need to use the new overhead tracking in all places where the
single checkpoint tracking is used, so remove the old logic. We would
have stats inconsistency and introduce possible bugs otherwise.
