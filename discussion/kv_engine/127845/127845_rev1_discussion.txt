DESCRIPTION:

MB-35889: Expel committed items from disk checkpoints

We only want to do this for disk checkpoints as the key index grows to
O(n) of the disk checkpoint. For DGM cases this causes issue when
backfilling as these indexes could become a significant portion of a
nodes memory. For memory checkpoints we do not erase keys from the
indexes as they are used for SyncWrite de-dupe(active) and sanity
checks(replica). Memory checkpoints are also not expected to be overly
large.

Line:512, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Note sure if I get this..
Now we do this for all checkpoints, is the plan to do that only for Closed checkpoints?
If yes, why?

*I meant "only for Open" :)

Mmm that means freeing up indexes memory in frontend threads, as we close/open-checkpoints in the same path of CM::queueDirty.
Not sure if that may ever have a relevant impact, but probably worth to keep an eye on MCBP/DCP throughput.. It also depends on how often we close a checkpoint..

In case, doing that deallocation in a bg-thread doesn't seem a bad idea.

Just dumping thoughts anyway, thanks for info

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:512, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> In the next patch I will make the closing of a checkpoint erase everything from the indexes. The indexes are only required when the checkpoint is open, and whilst we could erase items from the indexes of closed checkpoints as we expel it would be pointless. Instead, we can lower the memory overhead by freeing the indexes immediately on checkpoint close and just skip this step for expelling.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:512, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> We may try to solve similarly as we do for checkpoint-removal in CheckpointManager::removeClosedUnrefCheckpoints, ie:
 - we operate in a bg-thread
 - under CM::queueLock we just "swap" the struct that we want to deallocate (or something similar)
 - we release the lock
 - we deallocate

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:512, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Thanks for the comments Paolo. I think the suggestion that you made is reasonable, but requires a bunch of messing about with various CkptMgr functions and adding more complexity there. We don't have any evidence that doing this provides a meaningful benefit, this was just an idea for a potential optimization and I basically just cherry-picked Jim's patch, so I'll reopen the old ticket for looking into this and defer to Cheshire-Cat.
