DESCRIPTION:

vattr.exptime should be 0 and last_modified should not be negative

If a document has 0 for the expiry time, then it never expires.
The vattr code was always returning 0 + now() so it appears as if the
document had an expiry time of now().

For large CAS values the last_modified value was coming out as a
negative number, this is because cJSON uses a double internally
meaning overflowed seconds.count() was shown as a negative number, so
cast to u64 before passing to cJSON.
