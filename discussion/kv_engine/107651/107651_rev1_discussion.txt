DESCRIPTION:

[SR]: Flusher: skip de-duplicating SyncRepl opcodes

Only attempt to de-duplicate in the flusher (i.e. before calling
kvstore->set()) for normal mutations. While it's valid to de-duplicate
_some_ combinations of Synchronous Replication operations, we
currently do not:

a) We need to be very careful to get 100% correct (note we are
   potentially flushing the union of multiple checkpoints so
   potentially can have a large number of possible combinations) - i.e
   the risk is high.

b) We don't expect to see multiple writes to the same key (Prepare,
   Commit, Prepare, Commit, ...) in a single flusher batch, given that
   a Commit requires at least a network round-trip before a subsequent
   Prepare could be accepted - i.e. the expected payoff is low.

(The motivation for this change was that a bug was spotted in
canDeDuplicate() - it's not valid to de-duplicate a Prepare which is
earlier than a Commit, as we need the prepare to be able to correclty
backfill. However when I started to invesigate what was needed to be
correct in all combinaions (mutation, prepare, commit, abort) I
decided the complexity wasn't worth the expected benefit).

Also includes DCP Backfill tests for these de-duplicate scenarios.
