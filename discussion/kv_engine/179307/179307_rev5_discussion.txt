Line:159, daemon/buckets.cc -> Little more idiomatic to just explicitly convert to bool:

 return bool(engine);

Line:407, daemon/buckets.h -> Style: prefer string_view for non-owning string, or std::string if this method is going to take ownership.

(const std::string is a bit of an oddity in C++17 - if you cannot change it then it's just a more expensive version of string_view).

Line:412, daemon/buckets.h -> Could you document what the return value of the std::function (bool) is used for?

Line:416, daemon/buckets.h -> If this is always the case, then suggest we pass a std::lock_guard or similar as an argument to this function to enforce correct usage.

Line:56, daemon/buckets_test.cc -> Alternatively and range-based for is sufficient:

 for (auto& bucket: buckets) {
     bucket.reset();
 }

Line:63, daemon/buckets_test.cc -> You might prefer to use `TestingHook` instead of std::function which handles the null-check for you and so requires less boilerplate.

Line:159, daemon/buckets.cc -> Done

Line:407, daemon/buckets.h -> This is just a "refactor" of the externally visible create which took a Cookie object (but all that it used from the cookie was the Connection id). To allow it for easier unit tests I wrapped that one. I didn't want to change _too_ much in the patch by also change all of these.

Line:412, daemon/buckets.h -> Done

Line:416, daemon/buckets.h -> That would make it "unusable" if you didn't have that requirement. If you hold the lock you're guaranteed that there will be no new buckets appearing while you traverse. It is also "safe" to iterate over all of them if you don't mind changes to the array happening while you iterate (The method locks the bucket before the callback so you're guaranteed that it won't change state while looking at it. Note that it is however not safe to look at various _members_ in some of the states (creating, initializing, destroying etc).

Line:56, daemon/buckets_test.cc -> Except that I don't want to reset the first entry (no bucket)...

Line:63, daemon/buckets_test.cc -> Just initialized the callback instead
