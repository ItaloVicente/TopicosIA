DESCRIPTION:

MB-39745: Use RW KVStore everywhere [1/n]

Currently for couchstore we use the RO KVStore for read use cases.
The RO KVStore uses a significant amount of memory unnecessarily
as all usages of the RO KVStore can be performed by the RW KVStore.

Change the function returning the RO KVStore to return the RW
KVStore so that in a future patch we can remove the RO KVStore
entirely.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> What's the rationale / purpose of having the RO instance? It's always been there from what I recall; possibly to allow concurrent reads and writes but only one writer?

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Little difficult to say. The RO/RW store stuff was introduced here http://review.couchbase.org/c/membase/+/3613 before we even used couchstore and I have no idea how such an old sqlite behaved. Jira craps out on me when searching for any MBs in that time frame for some reason so couldn't find any extra justification there. Perhaps old KVStore implementations made use of this, or perhaps it was just a relic of Sqlite, but the current KVStore implementations look like they can deal with many readers and a single writer fine.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks for hunting. I think we should at least make sure CouchKVStore is const-correct, and ensure all readers (BGFetcher, Backfill, etc) have a const reference/ptr to CouchKVStore as part of this change.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Sure. It definitely isn't const-correct now, we update (atomic) stats on read failures and I suspect the CouchKVStore::logger usages aren't const-correct too so I'll look at refactoring those

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> The stats update is fine - we should aim for logical constness, not physical.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Then I'm pretty sure we're fine, but I'll double check :)

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Looks like we have logical constness for Backfill/BGFetch/get/getWithHeader
