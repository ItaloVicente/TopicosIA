DESCRIPTION:

MB-19889: Test BackfillManager::buffer limit on readyQ for Producer

The Stream::readyQ is std::queue. So, there is no built-in limit on the
size.
In the case of a backfill, an indirect limit is enforced by the
BackfillManager::buffer constraints.
Here we test that those constraints are correclty applied.
