DESCRIPTION:

Build speed [2/6]: Remove test-only code from collections/manifest.h

Using ClangBuildAnalyzer highlighted that the header
'collections/manifest.h' is overall 5th most expensive header to
include when building ep-engine_ep_unit_tests (and contributes to the
hottest, vbucket_manifest.h).

Overall time to build ep-engine_ep_unit_tests and top 5 expensive
headers:

Before:
      157.95 real      1516.33 user        85.83 sys

    *** Expensive headers:
    241177 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h (included 118 times, avg 2043 ms)
    171029 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/vbucket.h (included 100 times, avg 1710 ms)
     99087 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h (included 67 times, avg 1478 ms)
     92073 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket_iface.h (included 71 times, avg 1296 ms)
     91851 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/collections/manifest.h (included 119 times, avg 771 ms)
...
(7th 76278 ms: ../kv_engine/utilities/test_manifest.h (included 121 times, avg 630 ms)

A significant amount of collecitons/manifest.h's include time is
including <utilities/test_manifest.h>, which is itself the 7th hottest
header. test_manifest.h is test-only code, so really shouldn't be
included from production code.

The only reason for including test_manifest.h from
collections/manifest.h is to provide a convenience constructor for
Collections::Manifest from a CollectionManifest (a test-only class
defined in test_manifest.h):

    /// This constructor should be only used in testing with CollectionsManifest
    /// class from test_manifest.h
    explicit Manifest(const CollectionsManifest& cm)
        : Manifest(std::string{cm}){};

By removing this constructor, and instead creating a `makeManifest`
function which provides equivilant functionality the cost of
manifest.h can be reduced to:

After:
      149.27 real      1467.24 user        85.71 sys

    *** Expensive headers:
    173099 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/vbucket.h (included 101 times, avg 1713 ms), included via:
    162213 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h (included 118 times, avg 1374 ms), included via:
     99883 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h (included 67 times, avg 1490 ms), included via:
     93136 ms: ../kv_engine/engines/ep/src/kv_bucket_iface.h (included 71 times, avg 1311 ms), included via:
     79157 ms: tlm/deps/json.exploded/include/nlohmann/json.hpp (included 137 times, avg 577 ms), included via:

collections/vbucket_manifest.h is no longer the most expensive header,
reducing cost from 241s to 173s; and collections/manifest.h drops from
91s to less than 34s (only the top 20 heades are reported).
