DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Introduce the DurabilityMonitor

The DurabilityMonitor (DM) drives the finalization (commit/abort) of a
SyncWrite request.

For doing that, the DM tracks pending SyncWrites in the HashTable and
CheckpointManager and monitors inbound replica ACKs to verify if the
Durability Requirement of tracked SyncWrites is satisfied.

Note that this very first implementation represents what we name
ActiveDurabilityMonitor in the specification.

Line:54, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> can be const

Line:77, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> lock container to do the c.begin() ?

Line:85, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> can this be const?

Line:96, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> nit @todo

Line:29, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Suggest /** for doxygen compatibility

Line:41, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Does this even need declaring? .cc assign to default

Line:43, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Needs /** for the doxygen

Line:56, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> /**

Line:57, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Document that this call throws

Line:62, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Needs /** for the doxygen style

Line:67, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Needs /**

Line:70, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Use @todo

Line:72, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Comment says return memory-seqno, better name would include Seqno as State suggests it returns something else

Line:81, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Monitor

Line:85, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> use @todo

Line:94, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> maybe worth giving this a folly::synchronised style interface (see also Collections::VB::Manifest::lock) so you cannot access container without the lock

Line:97, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> nit: pending

Maybe clearer to go with pendingWrites/trackedWrites?

Line:48, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> suggest catching the exception manually (and inspecting it) so this test and the test above can check the exact exception thrown, at the moment you don't really know which of the two logic_error exceptions is being tested

Line:23, include/memcached/durability_spec.h -> nit: can remove

Line:54, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Done (also durReq can be const)

Line:66, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Done

Line:77, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Right in general, but we are in the ctor: nothing can modify class members before we return from here

Line:85, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Done

Line:96, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Done

Line:29, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Done

Line:41, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Needed to make the compiler happy :) otherwise:

"error: definition of implicitly declared destructor"

Line:43, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Done

Line:56, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Done

Line:57, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Done

Line:62, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Done

Line:67, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Done

Line:70, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Done

Line:72, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Yeah, in the short term this will return an actual State structure, but for now is just the replica seqno
Done

Line:81, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Done

Line:85, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Done

Line:94, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> It is, but it seems that we are close to being able to use folly itself. Are you happy to defer that to a follow-up patch?

Line:97, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Agreed on 'trackedWrites'.
'tracked' is more appropriate as SyncWrites in this container can be also committed (until we remove them)

Line:48, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> Done

Line:23, include/memcached/durability_spec.h -> Done

Line:41, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> I mean remove from header and .cc, shouldn't be a need to declare it as default given the classes current structure

Line:41, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> From .cc:

> Note: moved here to allow the forward declaration of ReplicationChain in the header

But probably the right place of the note is here :)
