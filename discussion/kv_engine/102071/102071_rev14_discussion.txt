DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Introduce the DurabilityMonitor

The DurabilityMonitor (DM) drives the finalization (commit/abort) of a
SyncWrite request.

For doing that, the DM tracks pending SyncWrites in the HashTable and
CheckpointManager and monitors inbound replica ACKs to verify if the
Durability Requirement of tracked SyncWrites is satisfied.

Note that this very first implementation represents what we name
ActiveDurabilityMonitor in the specification.
