DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Introduce the DurabilityManager

The DurabilityManager (DM) drives the finalization (commit/abort) of a
SyncWrite request.

For doing that, the DM tracks pending SyncWrites in the HastTable and
CheckpointManager and monitors inbound replica ACKs to verify is the
Durability Requirement of tracked SyncWrites is satisfied/

Note that this very first implementation represents what we name
ActiveDurabilityManager in the specification.
