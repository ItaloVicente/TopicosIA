DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Introduce the DurabilityMonitor

The DurabilityMonitor (DM) drives the finalization (commit/abort) of a
SyncWrite request.

For doing that, the DM tracks pending SyncWrites in the HashTable and
CheckpointManager and monitors inbound replica ACKs to verify if the
Durability Requirement of tracked SyncWrites is satisfied.

Note that this very first implementation represents what we name
ActiveDurabilityMonitor in the specification.

Line:44, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Similar comment, don't think we should default this.

Line:83, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.cc -> Style: if you're using the default-created destructor you can write:

 DurabilityMonitor::~DurabilityMonitor() = default;

Line:54, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Not sure it's sensible to default this - in non-test code paths we should always know exactly what our durabilty requirements are.

Line:91, engines/ep/src/durability_monitor.h -> Do we need to wrap this in a unique_ptr? Note in the case of a std::list the actual element is already stored in a different allocation - so you're adding double overhead here - i.e.


             next           next
     [node] ------> [node] ----->
        |   <------   |    <-----
        |    prev     |     prev
        V             V
   [unique_ptr]  [unique_ptr]
        |             |
        V             V
      [PSR]         [PSR]

Line:18, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_durability_monitor.h -> You shouldn't really need the "../.." stuff - "src/" should already be in the include path.

Line:28, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_durability_monitor.h -> Style: I generally name method like this public_XXX as (a) it makes it explicit from the call-site this is accessing a method normally not visible from the class.
