DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Introduce the DurabilityManager

The DurabilityManager (DM) drives the finalization (commit/abort) of a
SyncWrite request.

For doing that, the DM tracks pending SyncWrites in the HastTable and
CheckpointManager and monitors inbound replica ACKs to verify if the
Durability Requirement of tracked SyncWrites is satisfied.

Note that this very first implementation represents what we name
ActiveDurabilityManager in the specification.

General approach looks good - few specific comments below. Note some of these can probably wait until later milestones if you wish.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Monitor or Manager? 

I don't mind that much; but design spec says "Monitor" and I personally prefer that to Manager as it's a slightly less generic name (see all the "Enterprise" Java code with "AbstraceConcrete...Manager" class names...

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> HashTable

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Monitor

Line:27, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.cc -> Not sure this is necessary - I think it's better to wait until a node issues a ack_seqno before you start moving cursors. (Note that in the later milestones you have a variable number of cursors in play).

Line:30, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.cc -> If this can always return success then it's unnecessary to have a return param - change to void. Unless we later plan to cap the size?

Line:34, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.cc -> You might find this more idiomatic / cleaner to return an iterator on the container instead of a direct ptr.

Line:29, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.h -> Can you get away with just a forward-declaration of StoredValue?

Line:59, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.h -> Style: prefer using an in-class initialiser instead of explicitly setting in (each) constructor - makes it harder to forget to initialise it in one or more constructor.

Line:61, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.h -> Can this be null? If not prefer a reference.

Line:63, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.h -> Probably unnecessary to pass via const reference - given this is a small / cheap object (and we hold a concrete instance of it anyways in this object). Just pass by value.

Line:76, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.h -> A plain "Container" type in the top-level namespace is somewhat polluting. Suggest you move it inside the DurabilityManager class scope, or cb::durability namespace.

Line:79, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.h -> Might be useful to define this here, given it's a new term for KV-Engine.

Line:84, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.h -> Prefer initializer list.

Line:94, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.h -> Worth adding a high-level comment describing this class.

Line:99, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.h -> ReplicationChain looks like implementation-details of the durability manager. I you de-inline the constructor then you should be able to move ReplicationChain to the .cc file.

(Same comment about PendingSyncWrite - I think it's an implementation detail and shouldn't be part of the public API. Can you modify to just have the public API deal with StoredValue* / cb::durability::Requirements and then move PendingSyncWrite to .cc?)

Line:108, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.h -> Is it necessary to wrap this in a unique_ptr? I assume we are transferring ownership into the DurabilityManager; and it's not a large object so it's simpler (and avoids the indirection of extra memory allocation) to just treat as a concrete object.

Line:121, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.h -> I think it's premature to inline this - please move to .cc

Line:134, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.h -> Ditto.

Line:20, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_durability_manager.h -> Please add a brief comment.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> DesignSpec says "Manager", Milestone sheet says "Monitor".
I think that Manager is more appropriate given the class functions, Monitor gives more the idea (at least to me) of something that just observes rather than acting, which is not the case. 
But ok with Monitor for the reasons you mentioned

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'm open to another name (naming is hard), I just have a bit of an aversion to classes named FooManager :)

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:27, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.cc -> Completely changed the approach in a follow-up patch.
Back-porting also here for removing unnecessary noise.

Details:
In this implementation the cursor points to the next SyncWrite for which the monitor expects an ACK.
This is similar to our CheckpointManager cursor logic (but implemented with STL cursor).
I'm changing the cursor to point to the SyncWrite /just ack'ed/. This way, the cursor itself embeds the replica-state.

Line:30, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.cc -> Returning ENGINE_ERROR_CODE as I assumed we'll have some sanity check here (not specifically for a cap to size, e.g. maybe we want to check that StoredValue& added to the pending list is really a SyncWrite? just guessing, maybe not needed)
Anyway, agree that we return void until we actually need differently.
Done

Line:34, engines/ep/src/durability_manager.cc -> The getPending() function has already gone in a follow-up patch :)
But, removing also from here as it is unnecessary noise.
Done
