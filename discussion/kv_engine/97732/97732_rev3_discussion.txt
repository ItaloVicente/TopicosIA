DESCRIPTION:

MB-30532: Simplify the CM::lastClosedCheckpointId update logic

Before recent optimizations, the value of CM::lastClosedCheckpointId was
updated depending on the checkpoint-collapsing logic in
CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint.

Given:
- that we don't collapse checkpoints in that code-path anymore
- the changes in MB-30916
Then we can:
- remove CM::isCollapsedCheckpoint, which is unused now
- simplify the update-logic of CM::lastClosedCheckpointId

Change-Id: Ic36bb900cc25e88a995e7bc7f71f695b007aac1c

Line:1047, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I note we no longer update lastClosedCheckpointId here - is that safe? Moreover, what do we even need lastClosedCheckpointId for anymore - can we just delete that also?

Line:1047, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> We still update it at line 69 in the new code. 
But, I remove it as by definition it is (openCkptId - 1).
Only used by:
- stats
- PROTOCOL_BINARY_CMD_LAST_CLOSED_CHECKPOINT

The latter sounds TAP legacy and I would like to remove it too. I don't see any reason why a client should know about CheckpointManager internal stuff.

Line:1047, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Do we want to remove the 'vb_%d:last_closed_checkpoint_id' stat completely ?
I cannot think of any module relying on that.. and if it exists, it should stop to use it in my opinion :)
I'll remove the stat in a follow-up patch in case

Line:1047, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I'd check that ns_server doesn't use it. It's perhaps useful for debugging, but if you don't see a use for it feel free to remove.
