DESCRIPTION:

MB-30532: Simplify the CM::lastClosedCheckpointId update logic

Before recent optimizations, the value of CM::lastClosedCheckpointId was
updated depending on the checkpoint-collapsing logic in
CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint.

Given that we don't collapse checkpoints in that code-path anymore, then
we can:
- remove CM::isCollapsedCheckpoint, which is unused now
- simplify the update-logic of CM::lastClosedCheckpointId

Change-Id: Ic36bb900cc25e88a995e7bc7f71f695b007aac1c
