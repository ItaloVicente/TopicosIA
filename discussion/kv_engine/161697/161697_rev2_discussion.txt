DESCRIPTION:

MB-47462: Prepare checkpoint memory usage tracking for eager removal

Following patches will allow Checkpoints to be detatched from the
owning CheckpointManager as soon as they become closed and unreferenced
(i.e., no cursors in that or any older checkpoint).

It will be useful to track the accumulated memory usage of checkpoints
pending destruction, and this can reuse the existing MemoryCounter
update mechanism.

Line:772, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> why a pointer and not a ref if its required?

Line:772, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Can't reseat a reference, and this patch specifically does need to reseat this. Could go for reference_wrapper if preferred though (or gsl::not_null)

Line:772, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> There's some good discussion on this question at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33306553/gslnot-nullt-vs-stdreference-wrappert-vs-t?rq=1

In the context here, I would say prefer std::reference_wrapper if Checkpoint never cares to check _which_ particular counter parentUsage is referring to (i.e. if you only ever want value comparison semantics); but if we need to know _which_ counter parentUsage refers to then a non_null ptr is the better choice.
