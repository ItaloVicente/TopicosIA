DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: migrate to std::filesystem

Use std::filesystem::remove[_all] instead of cb::io::rmrf
it does not throw exception if the target doesn't exist so
we don't need to catch the exception and check for ENOENT
and possibly throw the exception again.

Use std::filesystem::create_directories instead of
cb::io::mkdirp as it does the same thing.
