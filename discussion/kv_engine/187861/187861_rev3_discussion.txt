DESCRIPTION:

MB-53898: Add support for lambda config change listeners

When interested in a change in a config param, it would often be more
convenient to define a callback as a lambda.

This was not previously possible; a subclass of ValueChangedListener
was required.

For convenience, add `addValueChangedCallback` to which users could
provide e.g., a lambda.
