DESCRIPTION:

MB-53898: Add support for lambda config change listeners

Allows users interested in a config param changing to define listeners
as a lambda.

Previously, a subclass of ValueChangedListener was required. As a
result of this verbosity, a single listener type is often used to
handle changes in several config keys, even though an instance per key
must be constructed anyway (managed by unique_ptrs).

For greater convenience, add `addValueChangedCallback` taking a
templated Callable. This permits (potentially generic) lambdas to be
used.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> As an aside, while I can see the value in development on the 7.2.0 branch given this MB is destined for 7.2.1; it probably makes sense to merge this to master first and later backport.

As such, perhaps this refactor / new feature to support lambda listeners can only go into master and we stick with the old-style API for neo branch (given 7.2.1 is supposed to be a minimal release on top of 7.2.0)?

Line:126, engines/ep/src/configuration.h -> You're increasing the cost of every user who wants to include configuration.h here; for a templated version of something which happens rarely - i.e. I don't see any reason why we don't just accept a std::function<>, possibly with one explicit instantiation for each type supported, so the header doesn't get bloated any more.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Roger, will split out.

Don't want to dance between branches too much tbh, so other than the lambda I'll keep things here while there's a chance I might want further toy builds, _then_ flip those patches to master, then bp if/when approved for 7.2.1 (there's stats involved and we swap stats.def.h -> stats_definitions.json between here and master)
Line:126, engines/ep/src/configuration.h -> Done - ish?
