I think I might have misled you in the previous review - sorry for that!
Line:917, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> We always know which comparator one we want (the vbid/seqno one) - so I think in this case we can simply keep that part of the implementation details.

Sorry if I mislead you about static functions - that was more about making it obvious how values get assigned - it's less important (IMHO) in terms of how objects are read - and indeed the point of this function is is abstract the details of exactly how we setup each column family.

Line:931, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> Be wary of passing shared_ptr by const& - see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-sharedptrparam-owner.

I think in this case I've maybe confused you again - given this is a member function I don't see any problem in reading the blockCache from the object's state - we don't need to pass it as an argument. The issue I have is more about implicit mutation of state, not so much implicit use of state.

Line:937, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> name needs updating.

Line:950, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> same

Line:917, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> No problem, I agree with you in making this functions as baseline CFOptions builders. The point is only on the fact that our baseline options depend on members of this class.
Reverting to non-static.
