There's a large number of patches in this merge (and changed lines of code). Can you split it into a couple of smaller merges to aid in later binary chopping etc?

(I've been doing the last few merges much smaller than this; particulary when it's a large patch being merged).

That's what we get for people not forward merging the patches early ;) I guess that the people who did most of it should do the merge as they  know what they touched...

True, but people have been busy with Vulcan issues the last week or so. 

Note a majority of these are from the spock merge jim did earlier today; they should probably go in their own single merge to simplify tracking things; once that's merged I don't think there are many left.

I typically create a merge to the next level after I've merged the patch.. that way it shouldn't take a long time, and we won't get huge and hard to resolve conficts.

Sure, makes sense. As I say, the spock stuff was only merged today, and Vulcan is most people's focus currently.
