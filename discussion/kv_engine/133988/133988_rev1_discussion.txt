DESCRIPTION:

MB-40531: Combine MFU and age to determine an eviction score

Previously, when considering a value for eviction, an age threshold was
applied _after_ testing the MFU against a threshold.

Both of these thresholds were determined from histograms of visited
items - the thresholds are the values of the Xth percentile in both
histograms.

Thus, approximately X% of items would meet the MFU threshold, and X%
would meet the age threshold. _However_, it does not follow that X%
would meet _both_ thresholds. As a result, fewer items may be evicted
than intended.

To avoid this, the MFU and age are now incorporated into a single
score. With this, a single threshold can be used to evict X% of items
with the lowest score.

The current implementation provides items younger than 30 minutes with
a "bonus" to their score; older items with low MFU will be evicted
before these items. They will still be evicted if the threshold is high
enough.
