DESCRIPTION:

MB-36996: Simplify and remove reentrancy from NotifyTest

NotifyTest/test_mb19503_connmap_notify tests the functionality of the
DCP Connmap. As part of this it overrides the normal ServerCookieApi
to track when notify_io_complete() is called against a DCP Cookie.

However, the way it does this includes calling
Connmap::addConnectionToPending() from the notify_io_complete
override(), which itself is called from
ConnMap::processPendingNotifications() - i.e. there is a re-entrant
call back into ConnMap. Note that notify_io_complete() is normally
called from a non-frontend thread, in this case when a background DCP
task has data ready for the front-end.

This is not the structure of the real ServerCookieApi, which simply
queues a notification event for the front-end worker thread to later
pickup and dispatch.

Currently this inconsistent notification behaviour in NotifyTest is
bengin, as ConnMap::processPendingNotifications() is implemented by
dequeuing all items currently in the queue, then processing them
(calling notify_io_complete), then returning. As such, re-enqueuing an
item while processPendingNotifications() is still running on the stack
has no negative behaviour - it will simply return with the pending
notificatin queue having an item remaining on it.

However, a subsequent patch changes ConnMap to use folly::UMPMCQueue
instead of our custom AtomicQueue, which does not support dequing all
items directly, and hence dequeues each present item individually and
calling notify_io_complete() on each. When using that implementation,
NotifyTest/test_mb19503_connmap_notify hangs as the pending
notification queue is never empty and hence
processPendingNotifications never returns.

Address by modifying the way the test is implmented to no longer call
addConnectionToPending() from notify_io_complete, instead just call
addConnectionToPending() from outside notify_io_complete().

Also remove some unused variables.
