DESCRIPTION:

MB-44941: Check CPU supports SSE4.2

KV makes use of hardware accelerated crc32, which is introduced with
SSE4.2 . If it is not supported, an invalid instruction exception will
occur on its first use.

Exit memcached early with a clear reason if SSE4.2 is not supported.

Line:1355, daemon/memcached.cc -> platform crc32c already does this and uses a software fallback. If not, the fix should be in platform

Line:1355, daemon/memcached.cc -> Yep, sse4.2 check and software fallback is here https://github.com/couchbase/platform/blob/master/src/crc32c.cc#L362-L389

Is there somewhere else using the crc instruction (hard to tell from the MB backtrace where we sigilled)

The sse4.2 instructions are part of folly::F14, used in a number of places in kv-engine. It only has compile time options - so looks like this check is valid if we're happy.

So we don't currently require anything other than a 64bit x86 - see https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/install/pre-install.html.

I think it's totally reasonable for us to bump this to a x64 supporting SSE4.2 (given such machines have been available since Nehalem in 2008), but we _do_ need to get this approved by PM / documentation.

Comments on MB incoming...

Line:1363, daemon/memcached.cc -> If we ever make this a hard requirement it should be checked by ns_server as this will only result in an endless loop where ns_server starts to kick off memcached, we log and fail, restart etc.. (and the message from memcached isn't visible anywhere in the console so the user needs to log into the node to verify).

Yes it is true for all of the calls we've got to FATAL_ERROR, but the others  we've got are more transient and may go away over time, but this will never go away.

Line:1363, daemon/memcached.cc -> So see the discussion on the MB - PM have agreed to make SSE4.2 a hard requirement for 7.0.

In terms of checking for it - yes in an ideal world ns_server would do it (or even the installer), and prevent installation / starting up. However the cost of adding such a check (at this stage in 7.0) vs the benefit it would give is questionable - note we've been using SSE4.2 instructions unconditionally (and without realising) for around 9 months in master (all the CC betas), and the first time we realised was when Jon attempted to install the beta on a very old laptop - where it failed to start but gave no meaningful error.

I think this change (explicitly check in memcached, fail with a clear error message) is a good balance of cost/benefit - it's very easy for us to implement, and addresses a likely extremely rare situation.

As such I think it's reasonable to merge this as-is.
