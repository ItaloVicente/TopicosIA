DESCRIPTION:

MB-44941: Check CPU supports SSE4.2

KV makes use of hardware accelerated crc32, which is introduced with
SSE4.2 . If it is not supported, an invalid instruction exception will
occur on its first use.

Exit memcached early with a clear reason if SSE4.2 is not supported.

Line:1355, daemon/memcached.cc -> Can you #ifdef this x86 or similar? Save us tripping over this when building for other arches...

Line:1359, daemon/memcached.cc -> Nit: I'd make this a bit more descriptive - while it's completely true, it might be a little confusing if someone hits it (particulary if they arn't familiar with SSE). Perhaps something like:

"Failed to initialise - CPU with SSE4.2 extensions is required - terminating."
