DESCRIPTION:

Revert "MB-54876: Add support for magma dynamic block sizes"

This reverts commit e019d40fa8cf76b81216a263f4b2bf09082eeb3e.

Reason for revert: This breaks the elixir build 
(https://server.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/couchbase-server-unix/394577/console) as while kv_engine is using the master branch there, magma is not and instead is using the elixir branch, which doesn't have the corresponding Magma patch (https://review.couchbase.org/c/magma/+/184439) included in it yet.

If we want this feature for 7.2.0, then Magma needs to merge patch 184439 to magma/elixir branch before re-submitting this.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Is there an open ticket tracking putting this support back in?  I ask as the ns_server side of the support is dependent on this change.
