DESCRIPTION:

MB-36377: Move TransactionContext to a new file

When we move the pending reqs queues to TransactionContexts we will
do so by subclassing TransactionContext. Currently as we use
subclasses of TransactionContext (EPTransactionContext) to invoke
the persistence callback we have a problem with the class hierarchy
as logically these new TransactionContext subclasses shouldn't
subclass EPTransactionContext but then we'd need one
EPTransactionContext per TransactionContext subclass (with the
pending requests queues). To solve this problem, I'm going to include
a PersistenceCallback object in every TransactionContext, and have
subclasses of the PersistenceCallback (EPPersistenceCallback) instead
determine if we invoke the formerly name PersistenceCallback. This
requires moving TransactionContext to a new file as it will need
to include persistence_callback.h which needs to include kvstore.h.
