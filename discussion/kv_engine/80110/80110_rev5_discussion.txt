DESCRIPTION:

MB-25011: Enhance store_if so vbucket state can be queried

This commit enhances store_if so that a pair of functions can be
specified by the caller.

1) itemPredicte - takes any existing item's item_info
2) vbucketPredicate - takes the a newly introduced cb::vbucket_info

store_if works as follow

If an existing item is found in cache, we call the itemPredicate (if
defined). If no item is found in the cache, we call the
vbucketPredicate (if defined). Either predicate can terminate the
store_if with a unique status code (predicate_failed or
vb_predicate_failed).

The memcached mutation_context code is now changed so that if the
target bucket is a full-eviction bucket both an itemPredicate and
a vbucketPredicate are configured. If the item is in cached, great
the itemPredicate can determine if we need to fail and run the
xattr-merge logic. If the item is not in cache the vbucketPredicate
will determine if the mutation needs to fail, and go into the xattr
merge logic. In this case there is no further optimisation, i.e. there
may be no existing item or the existing item may not be xattr, we
still just drop into the merge logic in the case we have to attempt
a bgFetch.

To support all of this some supporting functionality is also added.

1) The engine exposes an is_full_eviction method, returning true if
the bucket is configured in that mode.

2) ep-engine tracks if a vbucket is xattr dirty by looking at the
datatype of mutations. The first mutation that is xattr, switches
this state. Persistent buckets write flush that bool into the _local
document so that we can warm-up and still correctly report the xattr
dirty state.

Line:25, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'm wondering if we can simplify this (so the engine_api doesn't have to expose the eviction type) by say adding a property to cb::vbucket_info / item_info indicating if the item's metadata is currently resident?

I ask partly because Instant Karma plans to blur the lines between value and full-eviction - instead a VBucket may change during runtime. Additionally, it would be nicer if we didn't have to add an additional method to the engine API.

Line:43, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might be nice to split this functionality into it's own patch - this has grown pretty big now :)
