DESCRIPTION:

MB-46046: [3/5] Expose HdrHistogram iteration modes as iterator ranges

adds HdrHistogram::{linear,log,percentile,recorded}View() to expose the
underlying hdr iterator modes.

Each view method returns an iterator range suitable for use with ranged
based for loops:

 for (const auto& bucket: histogram.percentileView()) {...}

To avoid confusion over the preferred interface, makes make*Iterator()
methods private.
