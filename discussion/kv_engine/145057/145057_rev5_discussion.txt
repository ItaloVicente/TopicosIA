DESCRIPTION:

MB-43052: Magma - Read droppedCollections of snapshot at scan

To ensure consistency we must read the droppedCollections of the
snapshot that we scan rather than the latest version. Not doing
so may result in sending logically deleted items to consumers.

Change-Id: I28acb74378ec691d4306f45041491f00cdc8d23d
