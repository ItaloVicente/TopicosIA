DESCRIPTION:

MB-33167 [SR]: DCP Producer sends DCP_ABORT

With this patch a queue_op::abort_sync_write item is streamed to a DCP
Consumer as a DCP_ABORT message.
Note that Abort items (as Prepare) are ignored for pre-MH replica
connections.

Note: Currently we send the Key in the DPC_ABORT payload. That is just
temporary and will be removed as soon as we have implemented the
DurabilityMonitor at Replica.

Change-Id: I265093bf130a633f2a58bf59f8da6c4eb8fe8d2b

Line:2391, daemon/connection.cc -> Might be worth raising an MB to track this optimisation - both for abort and commit (can use the same MB).

Line:2397, daemon/connection.cc -> DcpAbort ?!

Line:86, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.cc -> Is this correct? Don't we have an extra seqno in an abort msg compared to a mutation?

Line:509, engines/ep/src/item.h -> You can at least use a cb::uint48_t which only adds 6 bytes (assuming alignment doesn't mess you up...)

Line:160, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> Note you might introduce lock ordering issues by exposing this, as the caller /should/ have streamMutex owned. Suggest adding a std::lock_guard& argment to this to enforce the locking.

Line:3005, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> This is a very long test. Can be be simplified / broken into smaller sub-tests?

Line:1419, include/memcached/protocol_binary.h -> While camelCase in general is the desired naming style, the entirety of this file uses snake_case, and the coding standard does say consistency is the most important thing:

> If you are extending, enhancing, or bug fixing already implemented code, use the style that is already being used so that the source is uniform and easy to follow.

Line:2391, daemon/connection.cc -> MB-33645.
Done

Line:2397, daemon/connection.cc -> Done

Line:160, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> Probably you meant to acquire the lock here before calling down to popFromReadyQ() .. ?
I would need to expose also the streamMutex for the client to lock on otherwise

Line:3005, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> We actually missed a DCP_PREPARE test.
I moved the Prepare part in a dedicated function that is re-used by the DCP_ABORT test.
As a note, we miss a DCP_COMMIT test, so the Prepare test-function will be re-used also for that.
Done.

Line:1419, include/memcached/protocol_binary.h -> Done

Line:86, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.cc -> Checking, Abort has the same size of Commit, here assumed that Commit is correct.

Line:86, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.cc -> Both Commit and Abort are wrong.
Note that this is the size of MutationResponse header, so Request header + extras size.

Commit is: 24 + 8 (as payload is prepare-seqno + commit-seqno)
Abort is: 24 + 8 (as payload is prepare-seqno + abort-seqno)
