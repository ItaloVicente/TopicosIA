DESCRIPTION:

MB-37789: Make Rollback use correct read snapshot

This is patch 2 of 3. It is dependent on patch 1 in magma to be pushed
to master first before it will compile. This is because it does not
appear to be possible to link patches by Change-Id to coordinate the
patch checkin.

Rollback was passing to the callback incorrect snapshots which were
used as part of the Get function to retrieve the meta data and value.
The Get function call is not even required since the EPDiskRollbackCB
does all the necessary work and we are pointing at the target rollback
point. We just need to pass in the key and meta data.

The check of deleted collections is probably not required but its being
done in couch-kvstore and I want to maintain equivalency.
