DESCRIPTION:

MB-37789: Make Rollback use correct read snapshot

Rollback was passing to the callback incorrect snapshots which were
used as part of the Get function to retrieve the meta data and value.
Since the rollback has already moved the read snapshot back to the
rollback point, it can use Get to read the meta data which is required
for the callback.

The test for this situation is part of the missing tests which haven't
been turned on yet for magma.

A subsequent checkin will be done to correct the API.

Line:2140, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> If we do a Get(), we will get a rollbacked version of the document with an older sequence number and it will be different from the seqno in the keys callback.

This condition needs to be removed right?

Also, it might be worth checking, despite having this bug kv-engine rollback test with magma is still passing?

Line:2140, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> The meta data does not appear to be needed by the callback. I believe the durability of the key is determined by the key itself (the prefix). The rollback callback (EPDiskRollbackCB) does a lookup of the key on the rolled back version (target version) and does the rest of the heavy lifting from there. I think the Get can be entirely removed and we just pass back keys and let the callback do all the work. Is that your analysis?
