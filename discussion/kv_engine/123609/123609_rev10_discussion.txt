DESCRIPTION:

MB-37789: Make Rollback use correct read snapshot

Rollback was passing to the callback incorrect snapshots which were
used as part of the Get function to retrieve the meta data and value.
The Get function call is not even required since the EPDiskRollbackCB
does all the necessary work and we are pointing at the target rollback
point. We just need to pass in the key and meta data.
