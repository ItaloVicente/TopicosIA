DESCRIPTION:

MB-37789: Make Rollback use correct read snapshot

Rollback was passing to the callback incorrect snapshots which were
used as part of the Get function to retrieve the meta data and value.
The Get function call is not even required since the EPDiskRollbackCB
does all the necessary work and we are pointing at the target rollback
point. We just need to pass in the key and meta data.

Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

My interpretation of this change is that rollback was previously broken and used the wrong snapshot. Would like some more test coverage for this (either enable existing tests that failed without this fix, or tweak/add tests as appropriate). 

Might be worth investigating the tests in evp_store_rollback_test.cc. Got a bunch of rollback tests there that I think currently only run for couchstore. They were expanded for durability instead of ones in kvstore_test so they might pick up on this.

Patch Set 7:

Unfortunately, that's probably not the way to go at this point. This bug was found during QE testing when it probably would have been found with the tests that you've identified. But, we can't run those tests without several other changes. Those changes included the compaction callback, which magma team waited for for at least a year. Then, other changes done in magma and kv have made it more difficult to get those tests to run. Recently, within the last month, we've made strides to getting those tests to run and some of those changes are included in this patch sequence. We still have some work to do until we are able to run the module tests but we are getting there. I'm asking that you approve this checkin as it has been proven to work with QE tests and when kv team gets the module tests working, it should give us the coverage that we need.

I had a quick look at the patches in this sequence and didn't see any which enabled any of the rollback unit tests. 

At the very least we do need (unit) tests to defend this new functionality - as you pointed out yourself we had to rely on QE system tests to find bugs in rollback when using Magma. Without tests how do we know this code checkin is correct?

As I said in my previous comment, we know it works because the QE test that uncovered the problem now passes. We have tests that cover this, its just that it was late in the game and the unit tests would/should have covered it earlier. Since we do have a test that was failing and now passing, that proves this checkin works, which is why I'm asking for a postponement of the module tests since those are quite challenging to get working.

So a couple of things:

1) Can you point us at the results of the QE test which previously failed and now passes?
2) It's great the QE test shows it now passes, but what happens if something inadvertently now "broke" rollback support with Magma - say some code changes in either Magma or KV-Engine? Tests allow functionality to be "defended" so any breakage will be detected by Commit-Validation.

New functionality / bugfixes *need* tests to ensure it is defended.

The defect MB-37789 has information on the defect.
I have no defense to the 2nd statement. Everyone would agree that it would have been better to have the module tests running but unfortunately, every proposed change to get them to work was rejected and the potential fix was delayed for quite awhile which sort of put us into this situation. I'm asking for some leeway until we get out of this situation.

I've uploaded http://review.couchbase.org/123848 which allows RollbackTest as mentioned by @Ben to be instantiated for Magma - you just need to modify line 2208 to add "magma" as a backend. That should give you a framework to enable / update tests to fix magma.
