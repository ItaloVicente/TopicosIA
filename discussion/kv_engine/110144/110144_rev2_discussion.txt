DESCRIPTION:

HashBucketLock: Fix defaulted-function-deleted warning

As reported by clang 8, the move assigment operator of
StoredValueProxy is implicitly deleted because one of it's members (of
type HashBucketLock) does _not_ have a move assignment operator
itself:

    kv_engine/engines/ep/src/hash_table.h:682:27: warning: explicitly
    defaulted move assignment operator is implicitly deleted
    [-Wdefaulted-function-deleted]

        StoredValueProxy& operator=(StoredValueProxy&&) = default;
                          ^
    kv_engine/engines/ep/src/hash_table.h:720:24: note: move
    assignment operator of 'StoredValueProxy' is implicitly deleted
    because field 'lock' has a deleted move assignment operator

        HashBucketLock lock;
                       ^

    kv_engine/engines/ep/src/hash_table.h:397:9: note: copy assignment
    operator is implicitly deleted because 'HashBucketLock' has a
    user-declared move constructor

        HashBucketLock(HashBucketLock&& other)
        ^

There's also a further problem with `valueStats` as that is a
reference which also cannot be used.

Fix by defining a move-assignment operator for HashBucketLock, and use
a reference_wrapper for `valueStats`.
