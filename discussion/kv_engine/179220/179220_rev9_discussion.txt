DESCRIPTION:

MB-52676: Track the MFU value of all evictable items

Eviction seeks to identify "cold" items to evict - items which have
been used least/least recently, as determined by its Most Frequently
Used counter.

Previously, the distribution of MFU values was learned progressively as
eviction ran.

However, future work may change from evicting some percentage of the
items in _each_ vbucket, to evicting some percentage of all items -
even if that leads to uneven vbuckets.

This would better keep the hottest items in the whole bucket resident
e.g., a very cold vbucket may have everything evicted, rather than
having the same percentage resident as a much hotter vbucket.

To support this, it is required that a distribution of MFUs across the
entire bucket could be approximated. Learning this incrementally would
be heavily influenced by the order vbuckets are visited in, and may be
quite inaccurate until paging has visited every vb (at which point it
is too late).

As as step towards this goal, this patch tracks the MFU of all
evictable items in a vbucket "up front"; any action which may change
the evictability of an item, or its MFU, now updates a histogram.

Line:807, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Related to previous comment, conceptually this is just about if the freq counter should be tracking in a histogram or not - excitability it just the implementation detail as to why we don't track.

Line:469, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Maybe reword this sentence right now - it implies that perhaps the HashTable makes decisions on if an item can be evicted or not, whereas this is just about mfu tracking.

Line:475, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> In a similar vein to the previous comment, while it is technically correct this callback checks if the item is eligible for eviction, the actual reason _why_ HashTable cares is for mfu tracking. 

Maybe we should rename this type / variable to something like EligibleForMfuTracking or similar?

Line:807, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Indeed - I explored an alternative of making the callback just a "this SV changed, these were it's properties before", basically a prologue hook, and having the vbucket itself make the decisions, rather than telling the HT when to track/not track. It seemed reasonable but needed a bit of fiddling to have the evictability logic be based on (something like) StoredValueProperties for before and after, and disentangling ejectItem from vptr->eligibleForEviction

I'll keep it lying around, but for now will continue with the current structure but rename 👍

Line:469, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> right now indeed, Done

Line:475, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Done
