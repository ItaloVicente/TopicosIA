DESCRIPTION:

Use definition of THREAD_SANITIZER from tlm

ep_perfsuite performs its own detection of ThreadSanitizer, but it is
incomplete as it only works for Clang. Now we also use GCC for
ThreadSanitizer, this check fails.

Remove this custom check, instead relying on the check in tlm
(CouchbaseThreadSanitizer.cmake) which already #defines
THREAD_SANITIZER for us.
