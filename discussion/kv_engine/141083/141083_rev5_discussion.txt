DESCRIPTION:

MB-42943: Expose default engine empty key stats for Prometheus

The following 6 stats are now exposed to Prometheus, under the
following new names (to meet Prometheus requirements and to distinguish
from similarly named ep metrics, which may not be entirely equivalent).

evictions -> kv_memcached_evictions{}
curr_items -> kv_memcached_curr_items{}
total_items -> kv_memcached_total_items{}
bytes -> kv_memcached_mem_size_bytes{}
reclaimed -> kv_memcached_reclaimed{}
engine_maxbytes -> kv_memcached_engine_maxbytes{}

Note, these metrics will only be available in Prometheus if a memcached
bucket exists.

Change-Id: I97d26b62e2285ee305c13076418ef7bc2913e783
