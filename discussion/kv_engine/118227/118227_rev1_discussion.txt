DESCRIPTION:

MB-23086: Clean-up kv-engine allocator hooks

platform still provides new/delete hooks (which are now active
in the linked platform change), however these hooks are now only
useful for testcode that wants to do extra functionality such
as peak-memory tracking (BenchmarkMemoryTracker).

This patch removes all of the installation of hooks from memcached
and all memory tracking code in ep-engine, but leaves the test
code so it can hook for peak tracking.
