DESCRIPTION:

Reduce cost of including request.h

With the recent optimisations to other headers,
mcbp/protocol/request.h has been promoted to be the most expensive
header included in kv_engine_everything:

    *** Expensive headers:
    30128 ms: kv_engine/include/mcbp/protocol/request.h (included 162 times, avg 185 ms)

- The biggest contributor to the include cost is
  <privilege_database.h> (which isn't even used directly from
  request.h!) Remove it.

- The second biggest contributor is the inclusion of header.h; this is
  mostly needed as request.h has a number of inline methods which
  require the definition of Header. De-inline these methods so
  header.h is no longer required.

After these changes, protocol/request.h no longer shows in the top
hottest headers; which means it must cost less than 3996ms (the last
header in the list), compared to 30128ms previously.
