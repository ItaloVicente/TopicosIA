DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Collections offline upgrade utility

Add a utility to kv-engine which upgrades a single couchstore file
to be in the 'initial' collections state.

1) That is all documents in the file are moved into the default
   collection.

2) The file's vbstate JSON document is tagged so kv-engine can
   query if a file is collection upgrade.

The tool itself will tag the file with "collection_supported:false"
before the data upgrade begins, to help determine partial upgrade
issues.

The tool itself has the following options, with -t -i -o the expected
usage by cbupgrade

Usage:
 -v   Optional: Run with verbose output to stdout.
 -s   Optional: Print upgrade status of input file.
 -t   Optional: exit 0 if file is already marked as upgraded.
 -i   Required: Input filename.
 -o   Required (only if not -s): Output filename to be created.
