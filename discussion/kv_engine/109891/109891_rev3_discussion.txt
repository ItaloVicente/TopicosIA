DESCRIPTION:

MB-34017 [SR]: Use the High Completed Seqno at Warmup

For Durability, we have introduced a new LoadPrepare phase at Warmup.
That is necessary for loading pending Prepares from disk and inserting
them into memory structures (ie, HashTable, CheckpointManager,
DurabilityMonitor) for leading them to completion.

Given that we need to re-process only Prepares that have not been
completed (ie, Committed or Aborted), then we can safely start the
LoadPrepare scan from the HCS (excluded) onward. That's because by
definition every Prepare before or at HCS has been completed.

After introducing the LoadPrepare phase (and before this change) we have
seen an increase of 100% on the total Warmup runtime. That is because
the first implementation of the LoadPrepare phase starts the scan at
seqno=0. Thus, the full Warmup performs two full scans of the entire
seqno-index. This patch addresses the issue.

Warmup tests expanded for checking some slightly more complex scenarios where multiple Prepares with different keys are queued and committed.

Line:488, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> You should probably delete the vBucket before starting if there's previous state.

Line:503, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> Do we want to be resetting and warming up after every key? I would have thought we'd store a few and warmup a number of them...

Line:488, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> Actually this function it supposed to be called to adding incremental Prepares, eg you may want to test Prepare, Commit, Prepare, and you want to keep the previous Commit.
But, this must be done only once at the top of this function. Fixing

Line:503, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> Well you still have that. Ie, after you have added all Prepares, the last time you enter this for-loop you actually have "stored a few and warmed up a number".
But, by doing this you are testing that Warmup loads correctly many different numbers of Prepares.

Line:488, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> I made a wrong point here: given that the test is checking the SV against the Item at every loop when the VB is in a particular state, then I need to keep this inside the loop

Line:488, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> Here and below:
we have agreed with DR that the tests are ok, but we miss a some tests that fail if the optimization that we introduce in this patch doesn't work (e.g., we have HCS>X but we start the scan from seqno<=X).
So, we need to add that kind of check.
The idea is to expose a new warmup-stat that we can check in the test at every step.
