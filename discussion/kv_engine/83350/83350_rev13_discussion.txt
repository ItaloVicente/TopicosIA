DESCRIPTION:

MB-25342: Update how system events manage collections

Prior to this commit collection lifespans were managed with two system
events, CreateCollection and BeginDeleteCollection. These events
mapped to hidden documents (System namespace) and had unique keys.
Thus the life-span of collection beer, uid:1 may have a seqno 'stream'
as follows (e.g. if backfill from seqno 0).

seqno 3, key = $collections:create:beer:1 <- create marker
seqno 4, key = beer::document <- document in the collection
seqno 5, key = $collections:delete:beer:1 <- delete marker

Now due to the way we support multiple generations of collections
before the prior one is fully purged, this approach leads us to have a
seqno stream as follows (e.g. backfill from seqno 0)

seqno 3, key = $collections:create:beer:1 <- create marker
seqno 4, key = beer::document <- document in the collection
seqno 5, key = $collections:delete:beer:1 <- delete marker
seqno 6, key = $collections:create:beer:2 <- create marker
seqno 7, key = beer::document <- document in the collection
seqno 8, key = $collections:delete:beer:2 <- delete marker

With this approach (unique-keys) we have to maintain an increasing
amount of meta-data to enable correct clean-up of the old generations.
This growing meta-data would need to be in memory and the per VB
JSON manifest.

So to avoid this unbounded 'list' metadata this commit adjusts the way
collections spans are managed in-terms of checkpoints and persisted
data.

1. No longer do we have a Create and separate Delete event - a single
   SystemEvent::Collection will be used to cover create and delete.

   a) A single key represents all creates/deletes of a collection.
   b) A delete of a collection is just a delete of that system key.

2. Collection create/delete now closes the checkpoint to ensure we
   never de-dup create/delete/create into a single create, ensuring
   a client tracking a vbucket sees explicit creates and deletes and
   doesn't have to handle de-duplication E.g. "I've been told of
   beer:2 but never saw delete(beer:1)?"

So the life span of a collection now generates sequence numbers as
follows:

seqno 3, key = $collections:beer <- create marker
seqno 4, key = beer::document <- document in the collection
seqno 5, key = $collections:beer del = true <- delete marker

Now if we dump the by-seqno index we see:

seqno 4, key = beer::document <- document in the collection
seqno 5, key = $collections:beer del = true <- delete marker

Now if we dump the by-seqno index after re-creating the collection,
we see.

seqno 4, key = beer::document <- document in the collection
seqno 6, key = $collections:beer <- create marker

And if we had performed cycles of create/delete we can see that there
are no longer many keys associated with the collection resulting in no
extra meta data to store so we can remove old markers.

Note in these examples, DCP wouldn't just replicate the by-seqno index
as seqno 4 can be identified as being logically deleted (it has a
seqno < start of beer). Additionally for a backfill from 0 in the
first example seqno 5 doesn't need to be sent either because the
client cannot know about the create. These enhancements are not part
of this commit.
