DESCRIPTION:

MB-44585: Check requirements and result of hdr_init_ex

hdr_init_ex returns a status code, which should be checked. If it is
non-zero, the histogram may not have been initialised.

Additionally, by pre-checking some known requirements, we can generate
more informative exceptions, rather than just EINVAL.
