DESCRIPTION:

MB-44585: Check requirements and result of hdr_init_ex

hdr_init_ex returns a status code, which should be checked. If it is
non-zero, the histogram may not have been initialised.

Additionally, by pre-checking some known requirements, we can generate
more informative exceptions, rather than just EINVAL.

I think it's worth changing the types from uin64_t to int64_t to maintain type consistency with underlying API; other comments are more for future reference.
Line:302, utilities/hdrhistogram.cc -> These should be invalid_argument errors, given they mean the input from the user is incorrect.

You could also avoid this particular case by changing the type of highestTrackableValue to match that of hdr_init_ex().

Line:344, utilities/hdrhistogram.cc -> You've added it now and it doesn't really hurt to keep, but personally I probably wouldn't have added all the above "pre-checks":

a) It's of limited value given hdr_init_ex will check them itself; the only benefit is the improved error message but how often do we create new histograms with different custom parameters?

b) It adds additional maintenance effort - if a newer version of HDR_histogram say changes some of this constraints (e.g. greater sig fig range) then we now need to update this code to take advantage of it.

Wrapping APIs is a bit of a balance, between exposing something suitable for the environment it is needed (i.e. C API -> C++), v.s. minimising friction and overhead in maintaining the API wrapping.

Line:302, utilities/hdrhistogram.cc -> Done

Line:344, utilities/hdrhistogram.cc -> Hmm I agree - kept the lowest discernible check as that's probably the easiest to accidentally hit when adding a new histogram but removed the others.
They were useful while shifting all the tests around to remove the bias, but they probably won't have a good cost/benefit balance to leave in
