DESCRIPTION:

MB-33846: Correct use of NonNegativeCounter for system and temp items

Currently these counters uses fetch_add to add the difference between pre
and post values. If this difference is negative, then the value that we
attempt to add underflows (to size_t max - 1) when it is implicitly
converted to call fetch_add. Correct this counter by doing a subratction
if the difference between the pre and post values is negative.

Many counters are broke in this way, they will be fixed in different
patches as they expose a number of other bugs.

Fixing these counters does not expose any new bugs.
