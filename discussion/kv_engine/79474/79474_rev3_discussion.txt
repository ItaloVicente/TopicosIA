DESCRIPTION:

Resolve couchstore compiler warning

couchstore-gerrit-master CV when running under Ubuntu 16.04 (clang-3.9)
warns regarding an defined but unused variable.

This variable is from gtest and is defined as part of
REGISTER_TYPED_TEST_CASE_P. BufferedWrappedOpsTest is registered in
couchstore/tests/wrapped_fileops_test.h and is used in couchstore tests,
but is also included in a kv_engine test, couch-fs-stats-test.cc.

BufferedWrappedOpsTest is instantiated elsewhere, but is not needed in
the kv_engine test. This patch instantiates it with an empty type list,
preventing the warning.
