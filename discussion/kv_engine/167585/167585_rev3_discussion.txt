DESCRIPTION:

MB-49858: Compaction throttle: snooze waiting tasks forever

When scheduling a compaction, if too many compaction tasks are already
running we put the new task to sleep instead of running it
immediately. When a running compaction task completes it will wake up
a sleeping task.

However, we only sleep the task for 60s. I assume the intent here is
that 60s is sufficientl long for one of the currently-running
compaction tasks to complete; however with large vBuckets and/or slow
disks this isn't necessarily the case and the sleeping task could wake
and be run before the current compaction task has finished. This would
result in the compaction throttle limit being exceeded.

Address this by changing the sleep to "forever" - and relying solely
on the currently running compaction task(s) finishing to wake the
sleeper up.

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think that this fixes MB-41323 too (the latter part anyway). The former is already fixed. Don't know if you want to put it in the commit message or just close it
