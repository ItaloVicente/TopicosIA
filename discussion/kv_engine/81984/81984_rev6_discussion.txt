DESCRIPTION:

MB-25342: Introduce Collection::uid to the VB::Manifest

Many functions on VB::Manifest required the caller to specify the name
and a uint32_t as separate parameters when trying to identify a
collection. This is now cleaned up so that a new class is used when
identifying a specific 'generation' of a collection.

As part of this new class we are removing the use of 'revision' and
replacing it with 'uid', however we use the Manifest::revision as
the uid and later changes will change the Manifest format so that each
collection is assigned a uid.

As part of the clean-up of revision usage this commit fixes some short
comings in the VB::Manifest management where a delete of a collection
was updating it's revision, forcing later callers of completeDeletion
to use the newer revision, instead of referring to the collection by
the correct name:rev from when it was created.

This commit additionally cleans up the separator changed path which
was needlessly passing the revision through the various code paths and
even over DCP. There is no need it was set and never read.
