DESCRIPTION:

MB-25342: Introduce collection UID to the VB::Manifest API

Mostly this commit tidies up the API which was already requiring two
parameters on many function calls, a name and a revision.

This commit mostly introduces a new type to perform this job, but
renames revision as uid. Upstream changes will take advantage of this
and actually place a uid into the set_collections JSON manifest, but
for now the manifest revision is wired through (which is what the
tests expect).

This commit cleans up the separator changed path which was needlessly
passing the revision through the various code paths and even over DCP.
There is no need it was set and never read.
