DESCRIPTION:

MB-26470: In DCP stream objs use conn logger only if the conn obj is valid

When DCP streams hold weak_ptr to the DCP connection, it is possible
that the connection obj may get deleted before the DCP stream obj
is deleted. Hence, the streams that use the conn logger for debug logs
should check if the conn obj is valid, else must use a default logger.

This commit sets up stage for converting the conn reference held
by stream from std::shared_ptr to std::weak_ptr.
