DESCRIPTION:

MB-34367 [SR]: Clear engineSpecific on non-success IO complete

For SyncWrites, ep-engine returns EWOULDBLOCK once the prepare has
been accepted, in the golden path blocking the connection until the
SyncWrite completes at which point notify_io_complete is called with
ENGINE_SUCCESS. This results in memcached re-calling the same method
again, which now returns success (as ep-engine records the fact a
SyncWrite is in progrss via storeEngineSpecific().

If a SyncWrite is aborted then the notify_io_complete() is passed
status:ambiguous; which memcached immediately returns to the client.

However, in the non-success case the previous engineSpecific is *not*
cleared. As a consequence the _next_ SyncWrite call by the same client
will immediately return success.

Fix by clearing the engineSpecific on a non-success status code for
notify_IO_complete.
