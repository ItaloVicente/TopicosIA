DESCRIPTION:

MB-28453: [2/n] Add decompress support to xattr::Blob

A number of places use the xattr::Blob on data which has the xattr
datatype, these places need to account for datatype snappy too.

Enhancing xattr::Blob so it can handle the decompression is the
simplest function fix.

A number of commands are updated:

* dcp_mutation - which was the opcode that triggered the MB
* append/prepend/arithmetic - likely a redundant is_snappy test
  because they have decompression support in the getItem part of the
  executor
* remove
* subdoc processing
* doc_pre_expiry

Line:101, include/xattr/blob.h -> Perhaps move to .cc given it's complexity?
