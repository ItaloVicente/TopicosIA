DESCRIPTION:

MB-33333: Introduce VBucket::high_prepared_seqno

The high_prepared_seqno represents:

    The sequence number of the highest prepared SyncWrite which has
    locally met its durability requirements and all earlier SyncWrites
    have locally met their requirements, and hence can be acknowledged
    to the active.

Given that SyncWrites are prepared (and committed) in-order, the
high_committed_seqno represents a partitioning of the SyncWrites
against a vBucket:

- All SyncWrites (as identified by their prepared seqno) less than or
  equal to the high_prepared_seqno have locally met their durability
  requirements (or aborted if they failed to meet their requirements
  in time).

- All SyncWrites with seqno greater than the high_prepared_seqno have
  not yet met their requirements.

This patch adds the method VBucket::getHighPreparedSeqno() to read the
high_prepared_seqno; it will be maintained and updated by the
DurabilityMonitor (in subsequent patches).
