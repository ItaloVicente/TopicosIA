DESCRIPTION:

MB-33784: Don't dedupe in flusher if not required

Some backend KVStores will perform dedupe for us so doing the work
in the flusher is unnecessary.

Many tests assert the sizes of flush batches (as reported by the
flusher and not the KVStore) and these numbers will now have changed
in any tests that relied in some way on flusher dedupe. These tests
now check the expected behaviour and supply the correct expectation
on the flush batch size.
