DESCRIPTION:

MB-53657: Notify DCP frontend if cursor jumps into new checkpoint

A new open checkpoint might be created in two code paths:

1. Frontend, queueDirty()
2. Background, checkpoint memory recovery

While at (1) we correctly notify DCP connection, we miss that at (2).
The consequence is that DCP cursors migth get stuck at the empty item
in checkpoints like [e cs), and DCP item remaining stats never dropping
to 0.
