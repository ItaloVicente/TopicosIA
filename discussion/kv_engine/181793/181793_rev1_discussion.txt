DESCRIPTION:

Add ContinuableGlobalTask

A GlobalTask which supports continuations via .continueWith(f). The
continuation is executed when the task's run() returns false or when
completion is signalled manually via onComplete().

The motivation is to use this type to extend some tasks such as the
ItemFreqDecayerTask to callback when done for unified caching configs.
