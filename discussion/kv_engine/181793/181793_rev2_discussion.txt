DESCRIPTION:

Add ContinuableGlobalTask

A GlobalTask which supports continuations via .continueWith(f). The
continuation is executed when the task's run() returns false or when
completion is signalled manually via onComplete().

The motivation is to use this type to extend some tasks such as the
ItemFreqDecayerTask to callback when done for unified caching configs.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> What's the use-case for this?

Given the current task model is to have concrete subclass of GlobalTask which defines it's own name, expected duration, etc; it seems that if a particular subclass wants to do more work at the end of the run() method, it could simply override its run method to do that work.

(While a continuation model is indeed nice if we just have a single generic "Task" class where different objects of the class are responsible for concrete tasks performs; I don't think it necessarily fits that well with the current model we have.)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Ack. Agreed that it might be more trouble maintaining this base class than just adding a callback logic in the tasks that we care about.

One possible advantage of this approach is that we can then have higher-order operations on ContinuableGlobalTasks. For example, we could have a `continueAllWith(vector<ContinuableGlobalTasks>, [](){ /* all tasks done */ })` -- this wasn't directly useful in my case, so I haven't implemented it. Also, as you point out, not really the paradigm we have. 

I will abandon this change now and extend the ItemFreqDecayerTask where needed.

Abandoned

Prefer to implement this functionality in other ways for the tasks we care about.
