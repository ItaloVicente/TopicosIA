DESCRIPTION:

MB-34780: Clear the pending sync writes during bucket shutdown WIP

During bucket deletion all of the pending sync writes needs
to be terminated for bucket deletion to complete. As part
of bucket deletion we tear down all of the DCP streams so
there is no way for the ack/nack's from the replicas to
arrive and unblock the cookie and continue bucket deletion.

todo: look into use enable-traffic for this; need to
figure out how we can synchronize all of the worker
threads with the thread which sets that to ensure
that we don't add cookies _after_ we've fetched the
list of cookies to "terminate"

Lets test that this solves the problem for now, and then
look into a different solution after we've got a temporary
fix for the problem
