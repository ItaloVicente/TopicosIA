DESCRIPTION:

MB-34780: Clear the pending sync writes during bucket shutdown

During bucket deletion all of the pending sync writes needs
to be terminated for bucket deletion to complete. As part
of bucket deletion we tear down all of the DCP streams so
there is no way for the ack/nack's from the replicas to
arrive and unblock the cookie and continue bucket deletion.

(6 comments)
Line:979, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Given we are now changing state in this function can you update the method comment in the header to mention this? (I assume this is done to avoid double-notifying?)

Line:5820, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> As per comment in next file, probably more correct to hoist this up before setting `trafficEnabled`, and re-phasing to "Disabling traffic..." or similar.

Line:682, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Could you remove the similar code in ep_engine.cc: storeIfInner() - given we now need to acquire (in shared mode) the vbstate lock before reading `trafficEnabled` the use in storeIfInner() is incorrect (and redundant given we have this call here).

Line:884, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> I think this should actually be associated with the change to enableTraffic - it's *that* flag we want to make sure has been changed without any other threads trying to read it.

Line:1649, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Similar comment as per EventuallyPersistentEngine::setWithMeta

Line:1962, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Hmm, so this might require some more thought. 

The current trafficEnabled flag is a little odd - it _does_ allow some operations to occur even when false, if the underlying eviction mode allows it. For example, delete is permitted _even_ when trafficEnabled=false in full-eviction mode.

As such, flipping trafficEnabled back to false during shutdown wouldn't necessarily block everything.

Jim has been looking at this recently, might want to discuss with him.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:682, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> That won't work as we'll start reporting NOT_MY_VBUCKET instead of tmpfail (or we could update all of these checks to start by checking if we're in degradedMode and then return tmpfail...)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:884, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> The "problem" is that enableTraffic is a single atomic variable protecting the "entire bucket", whereas the state lock is on a per vbucket base. In this case I just need to make sure that after I've fetched the cookies list for this vbucket there won't be anyone else adding stuff to it.

I could of course do stuff like:

    {folly::SharedMutex::WriteHolder rlh(vb->getStateLock());
    engine.enableTraffic.store(false);}

    folly::SharedMutex::ReadHolder rlh(vb->getStateLock());
    if (vb->getState() .....

to get a "barrier", but this is during bucket shutdown so I don't think holding the write lock to the state lock while we're scheduling the notification task is that bad..
