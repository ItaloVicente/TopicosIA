DESCRIPTION:

MB-34780: Clear the pending sync writes during bucket shutdown

During bucket deletion all of the pending sync writes needs
to be terminated for bucket deletion to complete. As part
of bucket deletion we tear down all of the DCP streams so
there is no way for the ack/nack's from the replicas to
arrive and unblock the cookie and continue bucket deletion.

Line:5826, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Do we also need to cancel any bgfetches in flight (e.g. for regular GET / SET operations?)

Line:234, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> If you're consuming the argument (and the source will no longer be valid), prefer changing the ctor to take by rvalue-reference - see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rf-consume

Line:5826, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> We don't need to add extra complexity for that... delete bucket isn't in the "hot path" and the bg-fetches will complete "eventually" (normally sub-seconds)..

Line:234, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Done
