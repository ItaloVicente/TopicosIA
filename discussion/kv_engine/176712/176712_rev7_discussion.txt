DESCRIPTION:

MB-52490: Pass Producer to BackfillManagerTask

The ownership hierarchy is the following:

  Producer
    -> BackfillManager
      -> BackfillTask
        -> BackfillManager (weak)

, with Task that stores a weak reference to Manager.

That model allows scenarios where a Producer connection has gone but
Task/Manager are still alive. Task needs to run a backfill for
realizing that the connection has been removed.

With this change we give Task a direct weak reference to Producer.
That way, Task would spot a dead Producer (and thus cancel itself)
before entering any backfill scan-loop.
