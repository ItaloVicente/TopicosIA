DESCRIPTION:

MB-53052: Add unified_caching config field

We'll use this in a future change to implement specific behaviours for
the ItemFreqDecayer and ItemPager. In a future change the serverless
default will change to true, but it remains disabled while we implement
the functionality.

Line:1487, engines/ep/configuration.json -> This name is somewhat ambiguous out of context - unified with what? One might argue for example our current model where various components in a bucket (HT, CheckpointManager, Magma...) share the same cache quota is already "unified" caching.

I would suggest some other name which highlights this is sharing memory between different buckets - and just HashTable memory I believe? (Each bucket will continue have an exclusive CheckpointManager quota IIRC)

(naming is hard and all that...)

Line:1487, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Suggest to adopt "unified quota" to refer to cross-bucket memory sharing in code and configuration. The configuration can be "unified_quota_group" to indicate that the "unification" is among all buckets in that group.

Pros:
- more descriptive than "unified caching" -- UnifiedQuotaPager -- a pager which considers quotas for buckets in a unified way versus UnifiedCachingPager - is the pager caching something

- shorter than "cross_bucket_memory_sharing" in config and in code UnifiedQuotaPager vs CrossBucketMemorySharingPager

Cons:
- Your point still stands -- which quota is unified. The checkpointmanager is a % of the configured quota and that is not shared, but specifying that in the name might make it too verbose.

Line:1487, engines/ep/configuration.json -> How about "CrossBucketQuota" - or even "XBucketQuota"? Not _that_ longer than "UnifiedQuota", but I would say is less ambiguous outside of any other context...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1487, engines/ep/configuration.json -> cross_bucket_ht_quota_sharing/cross_bucket_ht_quota? As Dave says, we don't currently plan on doing anything else with at the moment, and a more descriptive name is probably better than brevity
