DESCRIPTION:

MB-36572: Always cache deleteCount in CouchKVStore

To prevent us from having to go to disk to read the delete count,
populate the cached value at warmup and always use that value. The
motivation behind this change is to prevent a lock order inversion
between stream container lock, file cache locks, and the collections
handle.

I should have included this in the commit message but this is to fix the following lock order inversion.

stream container handle => cache.lock()                   takeover stats
cache.lock() => DbHolder => collections handle            normal write - update collections stats
collections handle => stream container handle             normal write - notify new seqno

It fixes it by breaking the first cycle as we now don't need to open the file (acquire the cache lock) when we do takeover stats to get the persisted delete count

Merge conflict - are you happy to add the nice details above in the commit message when you re-push ?
