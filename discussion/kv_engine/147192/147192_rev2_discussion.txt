DESCRIPTION:

MB-44452: Use sized delete for Blob & StoredValue

StoredValue and Blob are allocated using in-place new (they store a
variable-length payload at tne end of the fixed length object) and
hence we must define our own delete operator to ensure the complete
object is deleted.

Currently we do this with a custom operator delete() for each class
which calls ::operator delete(void*) which is functionally correct,
but requires the allocator (jemalloc) figure out the size to be
deallocated - even though StoredValue / Blob knows its size.

Given we now use C++17, make use of sized delete (introduced in C++14)
for StoredValue and Blob to pass the allocation size down to the
allocator via ::operator delete(void*, size_t).

Reduces cost of HashTable::clear() by 4%, as measured by benchmark
