DESCRIPTION:

MB-35979: Ensure SyncReplaces check for committed values

A SyncReplace should only succeed if there is a committed value which
is not expired or deleted.

This patch fixes a bug affecting ephemeral buckets allowing
SyncReplaces even if there is no committed value in the presence of a
completed prepare. Replace previously only tested the state of the
passed stored value - this is insufficient as the passed value may be a
completed prepare, which does not provide information on whether a
_committed_ value exists.
