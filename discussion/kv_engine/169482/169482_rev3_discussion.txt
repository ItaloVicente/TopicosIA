Line:3100, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> I think this is too close to the config param name 'checkpoint_max_size' - which has an 'ep_' prefix added when printed via cbstats:

 ep_checkpoint_max_size

Suggest we come up with something which is more distinctive.

Line:3100, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> if you set ep_checkpoint_max_size > 0, then you'll get ep_checkpoint_max_size === ep_checkpoint_max_size_computed_bytes

Line:3100, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> My point is both of them have the unit of "bytes", but only showing "bytes" for one but not the other is potentially confusing.

Line:3100, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Maybe we are mis-understanding each other. I was under the impression we already printed the config value checkpoint_max_size - which will be "0" if the user has not overridden the default "auto-configure". I thought you wanted to expose the actual, calculated maximum in addition. Is that correct?

ep_checkpoint_max_size -> bytes, but 0 special meaning's is "auto-computed"
ep_checkpoint_max_size_computed_bytes -> bytes, no special values

Line:3100, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> The aim of this patch is to end up with 

ep_checkpoint_max_size
ep_checkpoint_max_size_bytes

which is nice at grepping.

What's the suggested change?

Line:3100, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Exactly 😊

(I'm concerned that having two stats which are identically named except for a 'bytes' suffix but have different meanings would be confusing to people.

For consistency I would probably go with 'ep_checkpoint_max_size' and ep_checkpoint_computed_max_size' - having one with the bytes suffix but not he other is potentially confusing - is one bytes and the other not?

Line:3100, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> So in the end you mean to have 

ep_checkpoint_max_size_bytes
ep_checkpoint_max_size_computed_bytes

That's fine, but for getting that to EPStats too we need to change the config param name from ep_checkpoint_max_size to ep_checkpoint_max_size_bytes.

Do we proceed with that?

Line:3100, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Yes sure that's all correct, no mis-understanding.

It's all about naming now. I find

ep_checkpoint_max_size
ep_checkpoint_max_size_bytes

ok for that you can grep "checkpoint_max_size" and see them both.

But you propose to differentiate the name of the two a bit, how? Something like

ep_checkpoint_max_size
ep_checkpoint_max_size_computed_bytes

?

Line:3100, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Well, IIRC we can have different names for prometheus and cbstats? If so, I would suggest:

* cbstats:
** ep_checkpoint_max_size (unchanged) 
** ep_checkpoint_max_size_computed (new)

* Prometheus:
** ep_checkpoint_max_size_bytes
** ep_checkpoint_max_size_compute_bytes
