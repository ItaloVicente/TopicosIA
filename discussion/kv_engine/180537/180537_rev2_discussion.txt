DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor] Use per-thread connection list

Previously we had a shared list of connections all front end threads
would use which have a lot of disadvantages:

  * threads needs exclusive lock to add / remove entries
  * we have to iterate over the entire list in each thread
    but only look at "the threads" connection (with a read
    lock, but that would block add/remove)

Given that a connection is pinned to the thread once created
it may be a "thread local" list of all of the connections for
that thread.

Line:205, daemon/front_end_thread.h -> This makes destruction (destroy_connection) O(1) - is this a problem if there's thousands of connections?

(and what was the issue with unordered_set?)

Line:205, daemon/front_end_thread.h -> (note: this patch move from a single std::deque over to one per front end thread so it should be a massive improvement from what it used to be)

So the set would be:

    std::unordered_set<std::unique_ptr<Connection>>
    
And when I want to look it up for deletion I would have the Connection* and not the unique_ptr. Thats why I had the map where the key was the pointer and the unique_ptr was stored as the value..

I haven't used unordered_set that much so it wasn't too intuitive to me to figure out how to map from the Connection* to the actual std::unique_ptr<Connection> which held the object when I needed to search for it...
