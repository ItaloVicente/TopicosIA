DESCRIPTION:

[Refactor] Use per-thread connection list

Previously we had a shared list of connections all front end threads
would use which have a lot of disadvantages:

  * threads needs exclusive lock to add / remove entries
  * we have to iterate over the entire list in each thread
    but only look at "the threads" connection (with a read
    lock, but that would block add/remove)

Given that a connection is pinned to the thread once created
it may be a "thread local" list of all of the connections for
that thread.
