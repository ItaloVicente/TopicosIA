DESCRIPTION:

BgFetcher: Remove periodic 2s wakeup

The BgFetcher task currently snoozes for 2s once it has completed any
work; periodically waking up 2s irrespective of if there are any
pending background fetches.

I believe (but not 100% sure) this was done to add a 'safety net' to
try to avoid the lost wakeup problem[1]; however this results in
waking up the task when there's no work to be done; wasting resource
and making it difficult to accurately follow execution flow. Note this
problem exists for other tasks in addition to the BGFetcher.

This patch changes the behaviour to instead sleep forever if there's
no work to be done; relying on notifyBGEvent() being called to wake up
the background fetched.

We use the same approach as ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask -
namely an atomic flag which is used in conjunction with snooze() /
wakeUp() to ensure we cannot loose any wakeups - the problem we are
trying to avoid is the following in BGFetcher::run():

    Setup to snooze forever, and *then* clear the pending flag.
    The ordering of these two statements is important - if we were
    to clear the flag *before* snoozing, then we could have a Lost
    Wakeup (and sleep forever) - consider the following scenario:

        Time   Reader Thread                   Frontend Thread
               (notifyBGEvent)                 (BgFetcher::run)

        1                                      pendingFetch = false
        2      if (pendingFetch == false)
        3          wake(task)
        4                                      snooze(INT_MAX)  /* BAD */

    By clearing pendingFlag after the snooze() we ensure the wake()
    must happen after snooze().

Additionally, this also changes the construction of BgFetcher to
initially snooze the task - previously it would run once immediatley
at startup and then sleep (for 2s).
