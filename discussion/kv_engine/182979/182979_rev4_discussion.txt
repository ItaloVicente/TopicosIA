DESCRIPTION:

MB-54386, MB-54455, MB-54452: Add ConnectionLimitMode::Recycle

Add a new mode for how the system should behave when one reach the
maximum number of user connections. This logic does _not_ apply to
the system interfaces (and the rest of the commit message only discuss
the user interfaces).

By default we continue to use the old mode of operation which is
called "disconnect". In this mode any new connection to the system
gets accepted and immediately closed.

The other mode of operation is "recycle"; and once enabled the user
is allowed up to 1% _additional_ connections, but when accepting one
of these "additional" connections the system will try to disconnect
one of the least recently connections. If the system experience a
burst of new connections so fast that the entire 1% of the pool gets
consumed faster than clients gets disconnected the system will
immediately close the new connection just like in "disconnect" mode.

To enable the new mode the following entry needs to be inserted in
memcached.json:

    "connection_limit_mode" : "recycle"

If the entry is absent (or set to "disconnect") the system will use
the good old mode we've learned to love over the years.

Call me a chicken, but it is hard to predict a number which would be
correct in all cases so it is possible to provide an absolute number
for the number of connections to allow instead of 1%. To do so specify
the following in memcached.json:

    "free_connection_pool_size" : 100

Line:337, daemon/settings.h -> Perhaps we can encode also as a config variable - for example make free_connection_pool_size a string type and if the value is "NN%" then it's treated as a percentage, otherwise an absolute value?

Line:337, daemon/settings.h -> So the "problem" (or challenge if you like) is that we don't know the "order" we end up picking up the various fields with the current parser code (we iterate key by key as we find it in the json structure instead of searching for the given keys).

It means that we could fetch the pool size _before_ we see the "new" max connection number; so the percentage you specified in the file wouldn't be of the value you specified in the same file.

We could have introduced yet another configuration variable to check here, but that would just be harder and more confusing... and _IF_ one figures out that one would want to change the default I don't think its that difficult to specify an actual number... (personally I find it easier to tune it with fixed numbers just like one do when specifying maxconn rather than thinking of how many would X% be if I want to tune it)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Still think we should use boost::intrusive_list for the LRU. I'll upload a proof-of-concept patch shortly for you to take a look ;)

Line:337, daemon/settings.h -> ok. I think for the "out of the box" config it should be a percentage given that automatically scales based on the overall connection count.

Line:337, daemon/settings.h -> And that is what it is... currently it is set to 0 and we'll convert that to 1% ...
