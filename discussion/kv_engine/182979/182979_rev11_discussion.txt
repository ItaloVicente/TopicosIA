DESCRIPTION:

MB-54386, MB-54455, MB-54452: Add ConnectionLimitMode::Recycle

Add a new mode for how the system should behave when one reach the
maximum number of user connections. This logic does _not_ apply to
the system interfaces (and the rest of the commit message only discuss
the user interfaces).

By default we continue to use the old mode of operation which is
called "disconnect". In this mode any new connection to the system
gets accepted and immediately closed.

The other mode of operation is "recycle"; and once enabled the
system will start disconnecting clients once we hit 99% of the
user connections. If we can't keep up closing connections at
the same rate as new connections arrive (and we reach the
hard limit of max connections) the new connections gets closed
immediately.

To enable the new mode the following entry needs to be inserted in
memcached.json:

    "connection_limit_mode" : "recycle"

If the entry is absent (or set to "disconnect") the system will use
the good old mode we've learned to love over the years.

Call me a chicken, but it is hard to predict a number which would be
correct in all cases so it is possible to provide an absolute number
for the number of connections to allow instead of 1%. To do so specify
the following in memcached.json:

    "free_connection_pool_size" : 100
