DESCRIPTION:

Add ConnectionLimitMode::Recycle

Add a new mode for how the system should behave when one reach the
maximum number of user connections. This logic does _not_ apply to
the system interfaces (and the rest of the commit message only discuss
the user interfaces).

By default we continue to use the old mode of operation which is
called "disconnect". In this mode any new connection to the system
gets accepted and immediately closed.

The other mode of operation is "recycle"; and once enabled the user
is allowed up to 1% _additional_ connections, but when accepting one
of these "additional" connections the system will try to disconnect
one of the least recently connections. If the system experience a
burst of new connections so fast that the entire 1% of the pool gets
consumed faster than clients gets disconnected the system will
immediately close the new connection just like in "disconnect" mode.

To enable the new mode the following entry needs to be inserted in
memcached.json:

    "connection_limit_mode" : "recycle"

If the entry is absent (or set to "disconnect") the system will use
the good old mode we've learned to love over the years.

Call me a chicken, but it is hard to predict a number which would be
correct in all cases so it is possible to provide an absolute number
for the number of connections to allow instead of 1%. To do so specify
the following in memcached.json:

    "free_connection_pool_size" : 100
