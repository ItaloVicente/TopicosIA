DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add ref count protection to guard against delVbucket [1-3]

This is the 1st of 3 checkins to add protection against race conditions.

In phase 1 we add a ref count to guard against accessing the kvstore
when creating/dropping a kvstore.
In phase 2 we will guard against race conditions for vbstate changes.
In phase 3 we will reimplement delVBucket and reset API calls.

Line:47, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Reviewing the usage of this and your adding a generic RAII wrapper (which doesn't conform to coding standards) for a specific usage, just to call putKVHandle

I'd suggest looking at how you can build a single class which does the RAII pattern for you, i.e. the putKVHandle logic becomes the destructor of such a class

Line:336, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> This is hugely complex, i've not seen a concurrent data structure like this, can you comment how all of the individual parts interact, if this code is actually borrowed from somewhere, reference the source.

If this code is trying to just be a rwlock, just use a rwlock http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/platform/include/platform/rwlock.h or a folly equivalent

If you really want to use  this class then please add unit tests for this single class, its complexity warrants stand-alone testing, e.g. stream_container_test.cc unit tests a single /complex/ class which we then use for other things.

Line:348, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> document what is happening here

Line:369, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Not used in this patch, remove and incorporate when used

Line:385, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> as above unused.

> Patch Set 6: Code-Review-2

Overall this patch appears hugely complicated for solving the problem, it looks like a single mutex per vbucket could achieve the same, and perhaps a shared_mutex/rwlock the same with concurrent access to read points and exclusive access during deletion.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Suggest adding the sequence number to the first line of each commit, so this becomes

MB-33463: 1/3 Add ref...

And update the other two patches with 2/3 and 3/3 so we can more easily review the sequence
