DESCRIPTION:

MB-46216: Check log format strings at compile-time (ep-engine)

Make use of the FMT_STRING macro to check format strings at
compile-time using fmtlib v7 in ep-engine.

If a call to the logger omits one or more arguments, then a
compile-time error will be seen - given the following (incorrect) call
missing a argument for 'bar':

    EP_LOG_DEBUG("Foo:{} bar:{}", foo);

The compiler fails with:

   fmt/format.h:2873:27: constexpr variable 'invalid_format' must be initialized by a constant expression

(admittedly not the most obvious, but you get what you get with C++
compiler errors...)

Note that this now requires that the EP_LOG_<LEVEL> macros always take
a valid fmtlib format string as the first argument, a raw string
literal is no longer supported - the following will no longer compile:

    EP_LOG_DEBUG("Something happened"); // compile-time error.

Instead, the _RAW macros added in the previous patch should be used:

    EP_LOG_DEBUG_RAW("Something else happened"); OK

Note: The issue here is that to perform compile-time format string
      checking, the format string must be wrapped in FMT_STRING() -
      before the format string is evaluated / passed into the actual
      logging functions / methods. However, one cannot pass a
      non-string literal to FMT_STRING - essentially by design it
      fails at compile-time if it doesn't have {} placeholders.

      To address this (and still allow both styles of parameters) we
      _could_ in theory do some complex preprocessor logic - count the
      number of variadic arguments at compile-time and only apply
      FMT_STRING() macro to first if there is 2 or more arguments in
      total. I got something working for GCC and clang and which did
      this, but it didn't work for MSVC and the GCC one triggered a
      load of warnings, hence just making original macros always
      fmt-style, and adding _RAW for plan unformatted values.
