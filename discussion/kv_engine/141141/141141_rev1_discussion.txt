DESCRIPTION:

MB-42977: Cluster_testapp: Enable stderr for warnings

Change the logging config for cluster_testapp to print warning and
above error messages to stderr. This aids in debugging any issues
which occur when a node fails to startup as those errors will be
printed to stderr (in addition to log file).

Patch Set 1:

I just tried this patch locally and I'm not a huge fan of the changed behavior as it dumps out _a lot_ of messages (related to DCP) in the normal case (success). When run under CV one don't see all of the output unless the test fails, but when running the program locally it renders the console "useless".

What about adding a new flag --verbose=minimal? or only change the default if not bound to a tty (which would be the case for CV)?

    bool quiet = false;
    #ifndef WIN32
       // make it verbose unless bound to a tty
       quiet = isatty(fileno(STDIN));
    #endif

It _can_ be useful to see warnings on stderr (and ideally we wouldn't have any during unit tests), but yes, they are currently a bit noisy.

However, I'm not very keen on changing behaviour based on isatty() - it could be confusing to a user if the exact-same test command-line prints different information locally vs. CV.


What we could do instead is change the default log level for the stderr logger - say from Warning to Error? That _should_ silence the tests in the normal case (we *really* shouldn't be printing error or greater for a successful run)?

Given that we're currently trying to hunt down an error we can just push this through and add a command line option to cluster_testapp to reduce the verbosity "back to normal" iff one ever wants to run it locally (which I do quite often)

(we could bump from WARNING to ERROR, but then again I don't think it'll solve the problem we want to solve here as it is only in a small handfull of places we actually log at ERROR level)...
