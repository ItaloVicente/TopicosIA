DESCRIPTION:

MB-42977: Cluster_testapp: Enable stderr for messages >= error

Change the logging config for cluster_testapp to print error and above
log messages to stderr. This aids in debugging any issues which occur
when a node fails to startup as those errors will be printed to stderr
(in addition to log file).
