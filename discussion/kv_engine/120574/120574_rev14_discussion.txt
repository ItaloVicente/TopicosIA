DESCRIPTION:

MB-37529: Ephemeral - Permit multiple range reads

Backfilling from the seqList requires a range of items to be
"protected" from being updated and moved during the lifetime of the
backfill. This is to ensure the resulting set of items is consistent at
the end of the backfill.

To do this, backfills take a range read marking seqnos X to Y, and
front end ops will not relocate items from inside this range. Instead,
a new item will be appended, and the old one marked as stale, to be
cleaned up later after the backfill has completed.

However, previously only a single range read was allowed at a given
time. This means that an ephemeral vbucket can only serve a single
backfill at a time, all others will be delayed. This can have a
significant impact, given that a vbucket might need to backfill for 3
replicas, indexer nodes, the projector for XCDR etc. all at the same
time. This is made more likely under high memory usage, if cursor
dropping is triggered (as in-memory streams will be forced back to
backfill).

This patch allows concurrent read-only access to ranges of the seqList,
allowing concurrent backfills.

There is also specific support for exclusive write access to a range of
the seqList, as this is required for tombstone purging. NB:
"exclusive" access here does prevent backfills starting, but as before
does not block front end ops; they will append items as noted earlier.

The "locking" is read-preferring, and as long as a single backfill is
in progress, the tombstone purger will not be able to run. As constant
backfills are not normally expected, read-preference is acceptable for
now. However, given the importance of purging tombstones/stale items in
terms of managing memory usage (as noted briefly in MB-25218)
write-preference in this situation may be worth assessing.
