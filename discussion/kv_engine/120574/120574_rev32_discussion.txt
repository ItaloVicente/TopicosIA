DESCRIPTION:

MB-37529: Ephemeral - Permit multiple range reads

Backfilling from the seqList requires a range of items to be
"protected" from being updated and moved during the lifetime of the
backfill. This is to ensure the resulting set of items is consistent at
the end of the backfill.

To do this, backfills take a range read marking seqnos X to Y, and
front end ops will not relocate items from inside this range. Instead,
a new item will be appended, and the old one marked as stale, to be
cleaned up later after the backfill has completed.

However, previously only a single range read was allowed at a given
time. This means that an ephemeral vbucket can only serve a single
backfill at a time, all others will be delayed. This can have a
significant impact, given that a vbucket might need to backfill for 3
replicas, indexer nodes, the projector for XCDR etc. all at the same
time. This is made more likely under high memory usage, if cursor
dropping is triggered (as in-memory streams will be forced back to
backfill).

This patch allows concurrent read-only access to ranges of the seqList,
allowing concurrent backfills.

There is also specific support for exclusive write access to ranges of
the seqList; this is required for tombstone purging. Exclusive range
locks block shared range locks that would overlap the exclusive range.
Exclusive locks will not succeed if a shared range lock exists which
would overlap it.

As described above, range locks still do not block front end ops.

The "locking" is read-preferring; as a consequence the tombstone purger
will be prevented from locking the needed seqno range as long as a
single backfill holds a lock covering any of those seqnos. As constant
backfills are not normally expected read-preference is acceptable for
now. However, given the importance of purging tombstones/stale items in
terms of managing memory usage (as noted briefly in MB-25218)
write-preference in this situation may be worth assessing.

Code looks good but let's hang fire on merging - want to discuss moving to 6.5.1.
