DESCRIPTION:

Add jenkins_failures.py script

Script to summarise the details of intermittent CV test failures from
Jenkins.

It attempts to group logically identical failure reasons together, and
then outputs a list of observed failure reasons, ordered by frequency.

Note: This is _very_ rough-and-ready - it "works" in that it extracts
useful information from our CV jobs, but it's likely very specialised
to the currently observed test failures - i.e. the filtering in
filter_failed_builds() will likely need enhancing as and when tests
change.

    Usage: ./jenkins_failures.py <USERNAME> <JENKINS_API_TOKEN> [--mode=MODE]

The Jenkins API Token can be setup by logging into
cv.jenkins.couchbase.com and clicking "Add New Token" from your user
page (e.g. http://cv.jenkins.couchbase.com/user/daverigby/configure)

Mostly just potential suggestions, and a nit or two.

Note - the "pythonic" suggestions come with a reasonable counterpoint of it may be clearer for future readers to _not_ change given we aren't otherwise a Python house; happy for any of them to be left as-is with that in mind.
Line:54, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> magic depth number?

Line:74, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Nit could use format here

Line:93, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> can't quite follow where these are used, get_build_info doesn't look to read them.

Line:171, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> I know moving these out of line would be a bit grim, but if these are executed a very large number of times

 foo = re.compile(...)
 ...
 for bar in baz:
    foo.sub(...)

Does notably improve performance.

If you were feeling wacky, I'm sure these could keep the actual re inline with a call to something that caches the compiled re, (maybe using functools.cache)

 @cache
 def compile_re(re_string):
     return re.compile(re_string)

 compile_re(r'0x([0-9a-fA-F]+)').sub(mask, key)


Buuuuuutttt all of this musing might fall under "premature optimisation" - feel free to disregard, just noting it anyway 😊

Line:184, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> unescaped, but I guess it's fine given the opening one is escaped

Line:205, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> this idiom can be avoided with collections.defaultdict

 merged = defaultdict(list)
 ...
 merged[key] += value

but this doesn't add much if there's only one occurrence of the `if not in`

Line:263, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> little nit, can be simplified to

 for _, details in sorted_failures:

Line:264, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> or if you were feeling particularly functional

 total_failures = sum(len(details) for _, details in sorted_failures)

Line:268, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> this pattern is often expressed as

 for id, f in enumerate(sorted_failures):

Line:269, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> squishing it all further,

 for id, (summary, details) in enumerate(sorted_failures):

Line:54, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Very magical - lower and we don't download enough info 😊

I'll add a comment.

Line:74, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Ack

Line:93, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Good spot - they arn't anymore. (A previous version didn't use a persistent Jenkins connection for each worker). Will remove.

Line:171, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Note that 9X% of time in this script is serialising / deserialising the JSON from the server - we typically only operate on maybe ~500 elements in this loop so I don't think we need to compile the regexes yet...

Line:184, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Something in CLion (pep3?) told me I didn't need it escaping:)

Line:205, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Ack

Line:263, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Ack

Line:264, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Personally I think it's more readable as-is (with the tweak to hoist details into the for loop).

Line:268, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Ack

Line:269, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Ack
