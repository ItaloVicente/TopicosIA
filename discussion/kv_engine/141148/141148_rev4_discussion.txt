DESCRIPTION:

Add jenkins_failures.py script

Script to summarise the details of intermittent CV test failures from
Jenkins.

It attempts to group logically identical failure reasons together, and
then outputs a list of observed failure reasons, ordered by frequency.

Note: This is _very_ rough-and-ready - it "works" in that it extracts
useful information from our CV jobs, but it's likely very specialised
to the currently observed test failures - i.e. the filtering in
filter_failed_builds() will likely need enhancing as and when tests
change.

    Usage: ./jenkins_failures.py <USERNAME> <JENKINS_API_TOKEN> [--mode=MODE]

The Jenkins API Token can be setup by logging into
cv.jenkins.couchbase.com and clicking "Add New Token" from your user
page (e.g. http://cv.jenkins.couchbase.com/user/daverigby/configure)

Line:263, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Ah, technically this suggestion wasn't entirely equivalent as this starts at 0 rather than 1 for the first item. _However_, id doesn't actually look to be used anyway?

Line:263, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> Yes, it was another leftover when I was printing a number in the output. Can be simplified / removed now.
