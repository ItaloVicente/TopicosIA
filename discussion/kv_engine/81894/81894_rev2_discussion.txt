DESCRIPTION:

MB-25521 Ensure phosphor is initialised before file_logger uses atexit

While 615e410 ensured that the file_logger was explicitly shutdown
before memcached returns from main, it is still possible that during
an unclean shutdown caused by std::exit or breakpad that the file
logger thread could attempt to deregister from phosphor after
phosphor has deinitialised - resulting in a SEGV.

This doesn't cause any significant problems since the shutdown is
already unclean but can cause confusion as to what caused the unclean
exit.
