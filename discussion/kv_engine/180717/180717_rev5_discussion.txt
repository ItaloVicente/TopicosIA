DESCRIPTION:

MB-52958 Add Magma config MinValueBlockSizeThreshold

Magma creates value blocks for values larger than
MinValueBlockSizeThreshold. Value blocks only contain a single KV item
and their reads/writes are optimised for memory as it avoids many value
copies. Right now compression is turned off for value blocks to reduce
memory consumption while building them.

This change exposes setting their threshold size as a config in
kv-engine.
