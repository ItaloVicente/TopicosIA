DESCRIPTION:

MB-52958 Add Magma config to set large value size

In various code paths in Magma, it creates many temporary copies of user
values across the call stack. When the values are large and along with
sufficiency concurrency in the system, the total amount of copies bloats
up the memory consumption. To keep this in check, Magma will priortise
reducing memory consumption and turn off some features that require
creating copies. This is especially important for serverless
environments which have low bucket quota.

Right now the only feature Magma turns off is compression. Since we
don't want to regress on on-prem environments, we introduce a new config
that sets the threshold for large value based on the environment. It is
kept as 25MB for on-prem which is larger than our largest supported
document size of 20MB.
