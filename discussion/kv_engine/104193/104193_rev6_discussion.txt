DESCRIPTION:

MB-32107: Resolve performance regression

Resolve the performance regression caused by changing the size of
ConnHandler and subsequently the DcpProducer by cache line padding
the mutex in the StreamsMap.

Perf testing was done against build 1553 and build 1558 of MadHatter.

Average results for runs:
1553 - 1973894 ops/s (8 runs)
1558 - 1923984 ops/s (8 runs)
Regressing Commit - 1938150 (5 runs)
        (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/101191/ - based on 1553)
This Commit - 1972524 (9 runs)
        (based on 1553 + regressing commit)
