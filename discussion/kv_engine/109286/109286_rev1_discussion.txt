DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Move HashTable::commit to EPVBucket

This includes a slight change to the commit logic to use the
externally visible HashTable interface instead of the internal
one. This requires that we allow callers to specify if they want to
avoid deleting Pending StoredValues from the HashTable.

Line:613, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Prefer findForRead here (if possible) - I'm about to remove unlocked_find in a subsequent patch.

Line:773, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> In general you should probably call find() again here (and not rely on `result` still being valid) - in the Ephemeral case if a range read was in play then the committed SV might be a physically different one.

While it technically doesn't matter in this case, it's good practice - people might expand / re-use this test code later so making it robust and work in the general case is desirable.

Line:613, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> I need an unlocked findForRead to do that because I already have the hbl.

Line:773, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> Done. This needed to be skipped anyway for ephemeral.

Line:613, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Then I think we need to add an overload for findForRead which takes an existing lock - however...

The change to move commit out of HashTable somewhat breaking the internal abstraction that pending and committed items of the same key are under the same lock (and chain) :(

That's unfortunate as it's potentially error-prone - the caller actually needs to know this (and use the same lock for both).

(Note after the current patches I have in flight, unlocked_find() has been removed; all callers (outside HashTable) are using findFor...() and let it do the locking.)

I *think* the best way to deal with this is to expose the (currency internal) findInner() method in HashTable, which returns *both* the committed and pending StoredValues (if they exist) for a key, alongside the lock. The caller of EPVBucket::commitStoredValue() could then call that to get both of the storedValues at once, then calling delete on the committed one (if non-null) - take a look at http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/109320/ for the new function.

What you have here is probably ok in the short term (until I get my patches cleaned up) - one of us will probably have to refactor once that new API is available...

Line:613, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> findForCommit now gives us a SVP for the prepare (because we want to modify it) and a SV for the committed. Didn't use SVP for both because calling ht.unlocked_del on the committed will then break stats in the SVP destructor, it's also simpler because I don't have to mess about with the HashBucketLocks
