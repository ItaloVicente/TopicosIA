DESCRIPTION:

MB-50543: Ensure we don't send non-monotonic snapshot start

Problem:
MB-50543 demonstrated that in some situations the ActiveStream would
send a DCP Snapshot with a start seqno that was less than the previous
snapshot's start seqno, causing a monotonic violation. We also didn't
see this within KV-Engine testing as we don't have any monotonic checks
on snapshot start and end seqnos for our DCP producer or DCP consumer.
Further more this doesn't happen regularly and is more likely to happen
when streaming collections due to items being non visible.

Cause:
This was due to ActiveStream::nextSnapStart being used in a situation
where we had already send a snapshot with a snapEndSeqno grater than
it. This could happen as we would update ActiveStream::nextSnapStart
when processing new items from a checkpoint in
ActiveStream::processItems(), where we had items for multiple checks
points but not the checkpoint start for the first set of items. This
would mean that we would use the first checkpoints range to set
ActiveStream::nextSnapStart instead of it's checkpoints range.

Fix:
Instead of ActiveStream::nextSnapStart being option make it weakly
monotonic to ensure we ratchet the value. Also when we consider
modifying the sapStart in ActiveStream::snapshot() only do this if
nextSnapStart is greater than the last snapshot's snapEndSeqno.

This patch also make more member variables that track seqnos in
ActiveStream, AtomicMonotonic<> to ensure we protect the monotonic
properties of a seqno. However, in some cases where a member variable
maybe updated but not moved forwards we've made them WeaklyMonotonic<>.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> There's a lot going in in this patch - tighter checks on various seqnos (good) and also the change to nextSnapStart. To aid in reviewing; and also make it easier to backport if necessary I think you should split into two - one patch with the actual bug fix, then a second patch which adds the extra checks.

Line:767, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> Do we definitely want to throw in production (and potentially take a bucket down) on any monotonic violations of all these variables?

The answer might be "yes" if they actually must be monotonic and it's better to go offline in a controlled way than corrupt data, but we should consider that option carefully for each instance...

Line:767, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> Agreed offline what we will keep ThrowExceptionPolicy only when dev asserts are on. As we're close to Neo release date.
