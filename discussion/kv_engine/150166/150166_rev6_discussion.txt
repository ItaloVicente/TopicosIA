DESCRIPTION:

MB-45347: Backfill always reads the full payload for System Events

NO_VALUE must not apply to SystemEvent. That is because System Events
stores in the value information that is necessary for making the DCP
message streamed to the DCP client.

While that was already the case for in-memory streams, at backfill we
missed to pick up the value for NO_VALUE streams. That result is that we
throw and crash when we try to make the DCP message from a partial
payload in the ActiveStream::backfillReceived path.

Line:2687, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Style: Personally I still use explicit `bool` instead of `auto` for two main reasons:

1. It's not any shorter, so there's no gain in terms of terseness of the code.
2. It actually _reduces_ readability - now I have to parse the rhs of the expression to determine this is actually a true/false expression; whereas if  `bool variable` is used I know that immediately.

Line:3814, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> If this is a precondition for the test it should use ASSERT.

Line:3820, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> ditto

Line:3826, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> same

Line:3814, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Not a precondition for the test, just a check on that high-seqno is increasing as expected

Line:3820, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> same

Line:3826, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Same. In particular here pre-conditions for the test are lines 3827-3828
