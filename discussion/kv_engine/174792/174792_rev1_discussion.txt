DESCRIPTION:

Modernize genconfig.cc to make it easier to read

1. Use auto keyword where applicable
2. Use for each style loops where applicable to reduce the need to use
   iterators.
3. Move to use fmt over std::string stream and std::err, as it's clear
   to read when deciphering what will be rendered to a string.
