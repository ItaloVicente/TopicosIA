DESCRIPTION:

MB-26705: Re-run pager if memory is still high

Before the PagingVisitor finishes, re-check the status of memory.
We could still be in a memory condition situation and shouldn't
return without waking the ItemPager for another round.

test_memory_limit has been 'ported' to the single threaded model
as the original test became unstable for a number of reasons, primarily
that the ejection didn't free memory because the checkpoint manager
still had a reference on the Blob. The ported test has also removed
some of the final parts of the original test that were unstable.
