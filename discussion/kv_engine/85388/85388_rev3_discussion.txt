DESCRIPTION:

MB-26705: Re-run pager if memory is still high

Before the PagingVisitor finishes, re-check the status of memory.
We could still be in a memory condition situation and shouldn't
return without waking the ItemPager for another round.

This test resulted in a number of older ep_testsuite failures which
have been addressed as follows.

1. test_memory_limit has been 'ported' to the single threaded model
as the original test became unstable for a number of reasons, primarily
that the ejection didn't free memory because the checkpoint manager
still had a reference on the Blob. The ported test has also removed
some of the final parts of the original test that were unstable.

2. item_pager_test has been adjusted so that it doesn't populate until
TMPFAIL. This is because the pager kept freeing space allowing the
test to write a huge amount of documents (making the test heavily DGM)
A part of the test which aimed to heat 50% of the docs is removed as
it doesn't really do much, and just battles against the pager cooling
items.

3. The two cursor dropping test are adjusted so they don't trigger
the pager, they now store items upto 75% of mem_size which still
triggers cursor dropping without the test having to cope with items
being paged out.
