DESCRIPTION:

MB-30916: Exploit the logic lifetime of CM::checkpointList

By logic:
- the open checkpoint exists always and is at position
  CM::checkpointList.back()
- so the CM::checkpointList is never empty

Thus, the checkpointList can only be in one of the following states:
- 1 open checkpoint
- [1, N] closed checkpoints + 1 open checkpoint

With previous changes I ensured the conditions above.

Here I exploit the assumptions above by removing:
- unnecessary checks on state of the checkpointList
- code branches that can never be executed
