DESCRIPTION:

[jenkins_failures] Group together failures with different numbers

Before this change, some failure outputs were not grouped together and
that made them hard to identify as common failures.

This change detects such outputs which differ only in some numbers in
the output, and replaces those numbers with placeholder names such as
{Var1}, {Var2}, etc. The values which were substituted are then printed
in the run details.

Here is a sample output:
```
Test failed: `' (Expected `{{Var1}}' to be less than or equal to \
`{{Var2}}'  - Unexpected fileSize for vbucket)

+Details+
