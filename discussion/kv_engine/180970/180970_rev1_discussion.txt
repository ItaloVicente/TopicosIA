DESCRIPTION:

[jenkins_failures] Group together failures with different numbers

Before this change, some failure outputs were not grouped together and
that made them hard to identify as common failures.

This change detects such outputs which differ only in some numbers in
the output, and replaces those numbers with placeholder names such as
{Var1}, {Var2}, etc. The values which were substituted are then printed
in the run details.

Here is a sample output:
```
Test failed: `' (Expected `{{Var1}}' to be less than or equal to \
`{{Var2}}'  - Unexpected fileSize for vbucket)

+Details+
8 instances of this failure (6.3% of sampled failures):

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

Line:162, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> think this can be replaced with match.group() for the whole matched string or match.group(1) for capture group 1 etc.

(incidentally, match.string also gives you access to the original string which was searched)

Line:177, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> capture group looks redundant as it captures the entire matched string.

Note that .span()/.span(0)/group()/.group(0) will cover the entire match regardless, .span(1)/.group(1) would cover the first capture group (but in this case would give identical results to .span()/.group(), hence the capture group being redundant)

Line:184, scripts/jenkins_failures.py -> might be able to simplify this with zip

 >>> all_matches = [list(re.finditer(r'(\d+)', s)) for s in strings]
 >>> list(zip(*all_matches))
 [
 (<re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='1'>, <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='4'>),
 (<re.Match object; span=(2, 3), match='2'>, <re.Match object; span=(2, 3), match='5'>),
 (<re.Match object; span=(4, 5), match='3'>, <re.Match object; span=(4, 5), match='6'>)
 ]

so maybe:

 for cur_match_in_strings in zip(*all_matches):
     ...
     if len(set(x.group() for x in cur_match_in_strings)) == 1:
         ...
     for s_idx, match in enumerate(cur_matches_in_strings):
         ...
     
but I've not followed it all the way through to see if that will play nicely, so at your discretion
