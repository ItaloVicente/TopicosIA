DESCRIPTION:

[jenkins_failures] Group together failures with different numbers

Before this change, some failure outputs were not grouped together and
that made them hard to identify as common failures.

This change detects such outputs which differ only in some numbers in
the output, and replaces those numbers with placeholder names such as
{Var1}, {Var2}, etc. The values which were substituted are then printed
in the run details.

Here is a sample output:
```
Test failed: `' (Expected `{{Var1}}' to be less than or equal to \
`{{Var2}}'  - Unexpected fileSize for vbucket)

+Details+
8 instances of this failure (6.3% of sampled failures):
* Time: 2022-10-05 10:03:51, patch: some url
 `- where {Var1} = `246561`; {Var2} = `234957`;
* Time: 2022-10-05 09:57:40, patch: some url

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> I agree makes sense to group together when actual value differs, 
I'm not sure that we should group together failures where the expected value is different - in general these could be legitimately different issues.

Could you give some examples of cases you are attempting to group together where the actual and expected value differs?

```
 
This change also makes failures containing the file name and lineno match even if the lineno has changed, which is quite common.

I don't see the potential problem you're describing in practice, particularly because the test name, file name and assertion message are present in the output, so I don't believe that `checklt(x, y)`-type failures would get merged by this. Also the actual values in merged outputs are preserved and shown, so there is no "information loss".
