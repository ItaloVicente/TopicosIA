DESCRIPTION:

MB-37680: Introduce DCPBackfillIface

Introduce a DCPBackfillIface abstract base class to be used by
BsckfillManager. This makes it easier to test BackfillManager's
behaviour in isolation from actual disk IO and DCP Stream objects.

Using the new interface, create a unit test for BackfillManager which
verifies DCPBackfills are scheduled in round-robin order.
