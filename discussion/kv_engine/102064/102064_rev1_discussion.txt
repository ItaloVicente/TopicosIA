DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Move dcp_last_ variables to producers class

Whenever tests want to check the dcp producer state there's
a bit of boiler plate in extern linking to the mock_dcp.cc
'global' variables.

Secondly the dcp_last_ variables are global... we cannot run
two producers in a test.

We can move the variables to be owned by the MockDcpMessageProducer
to fix the problems above. Tests can now be written to use multiple
producers and further work could be done to associate the variables
with streams for a more complete DCP test structure.
