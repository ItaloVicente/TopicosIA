DESCRIPTION:

MB-36146 Fix a race condition in CheckpointManager

Fix a race condition in the CheckpointManager when the following
sequence of events occur:

1. An active stream needs to be moved to the dead state so we can call
the destructor ActiveStream::~ActiveStream()

2. This then in turn calls ActiveStream::removeCheckpointCursor() which
gets a shared pointer to the checkpoint cursor

3. The removeCheckpointCursor() method then gets a lock on the queueLock

4. ActiveStream::getItemsRemaining() is called and gets hold of a
shared pointer to the same cursor as removeCheckpointCursor() has

5. CheckpointManager::getNumItemsForCursor() is then called with the
raw pointer to the cursor but has to wait till removeCheckpointCursor()
has finished executing as queueLock is locked

6. removeCursor_UNLOCKED() is called by removeCheckpointCursor() which
decrements the number of cursors on checkpoint

7. The checkpoint remover task then runs removing the checkpoint that
the cursor points to as its cursor count is now 0 and its closed.

8. removeCheckpointCursor() then frees the queueLock so
getNumItemsForCursor() can call getNumItemsForCursor_UNLOCKED()

9. getNumItemsForCursor_UNLOCKED() then tries to access the member
CheckpointList::iterator currentCheckpoint which points to the freed
Checkpoint and then when trying to access it we crash.

The fix for this is to set CheckpointCursor::currentCheckpoint to the
checkpointList.end() when we are deleting the current courser. Then
check before we dereference a given currentCheckpoint that we make sure
its not null and is not equal to checkpointList.end().

Line:38, /COMMIT_MSG -> Style: When I'm describing race conditions it's helpful to highlight what activities happen on which thread, so the reader can more easily see how the race unfolds.

For example in http://review.couchbase.org/114121 I layout the two different threads in different indents.

Line:361, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I don't follow why this is conditional - surely if we have removed a cursor from a checkpoint, we can just unconditionally set the currentCheckpoint to invalid (i.e. end()). ?

Line:78, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Please document this. Also, given this is a testing-only method (most normal clients of the class don't care about it), prefer to order it at the end of the public methods.

Line:150, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Suggest documenting why this is now non-const.
