DESCRIPTION:

MB-36146 Fix a race condition in CheckpointManager

Fix a race condition in the CheckpointManager when the following
sequence of events occur:

T1-1. An active stream needs to be moved to the dead state so we can
call the destructor ActiveStream::~ActiveStream()

T1-2. This then in turn calls ActiveStream::removeCheckpointCursor()
which gets a shared pointer to the checkpoint cursor

T1-3. The removeCheckpointCursor() method then gets a lock on the
queueLock

    T2-a. ActiveStream::getItemsRemaining() is called and gets hold of
    a shared pointer to the same cursor as removeCheckpointCursor()
    has

    T2-b. CheckpointManager::getNumItemsForCursor() is then called
    with the raw pointer to the cursor but has to wait till
    removeCheckpointCursor() has finished executing as queueLock is
    locked

T1-4. removeCursor_UNLOCKED() is called by removeCheckpointCursor()
which decrements the number of cursors on checkpoint

        T3-I. The checkpoint remover task then runs removing the
        checkpoint that the cursor points to as its cursor count is
        now 0 and its closed.

T1-5. removeCheckpointCursor() then frees the queueLock so
getNumItemsForCursor() can call getNumItemsForCursor_UNLOCKED()

    T2-c. getNumItemsForCursor_UNLOCKED() then tries to access the
    member CheckpointList::iterator currentCheckpoint which points
    to the freed Checkpoint and then when trying to access it we crash.

The fix for this is to set CheckpointCursor::currentCheckpoint to the
checkpointList.end() when we are deleting the current courser. Then
check before we dereference a given currentCheckpoint that we make sure
its not null and is not equal to checkpointList.end().

Line:346, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Wouldn't it be a logic error if someone called removeCursor twice (i.e. the currentCheckpoint had already been set to end() ?

Line:1098, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Given the checks elsewhere, do you need to check in this function if cursor.currentCheckpoint is equal to end() ?

Line:346, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> ah yes thanks for this spot.

Line:1098, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Interestingly this function is only ever driven from the unit tests. But think it would be correct in this situation to turn true if the currentCheckpoint is not at a checkpoint.
