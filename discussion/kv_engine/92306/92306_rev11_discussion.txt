DESCRIPTION:

MB-29236: Add max value to ItemEviction histogram if not eligible

We currently are adding the max value (255) to the ItemEviction
histogram if a storedValue is eligible to be evicted, but just exceeds
the threshold frequency.

We should only be adding the max value if the storedValue is not
eligible to be evicted.
