DESCRIPTION:

Add cb::mcbp::Header

The Header structure allows us to operate on the common fields
of a frame received from the network. The only two fields which
differentiate a Request from a Response is that the Request
carries a vbucket identifier whereas the Response carries a
status code.

We have cases in our code where we just want to inspect the
packet (and choose a different action if the packet is a
request or a response). In these cases it makes it more
readable if we can cast the buffer to a Header, and then
fetch the right structure off that.

Line:42, include/mcbp/protocol/header.h -> Please document what order (network or host) these fields are in.

Furthermore, given you're adding accessors for all the fields (which perform the correct byte swapping), I think the member variables should be protected/private.

Line:111, include/mcbp/protocol/header.h -> Style: Given this returns a bool then `isValid()` would probably be a better name.

Line:42, include/mcbp/protocol/header.h -> I'd prefer not, because I have use-cases where I access (at least) magic and opcode directly...

Line:42, include/mcbp/protocol/header.h -> Then can I suggest you at least make them const; so they cannot be accidentally modified.

Line:42, include/mcbp/protocol/header.h -> The factory method for the struct in Cookie returns a const Header& object.... 

It is not "illegal" to create such a structure and initialise it like one would want to elsewhere...  (making all of the members const would mean I need a constructor to initialize them to something otherwise the compiler will complain).. And that just adds "extra" code which isn't really needed..

The thing I wanted to solve with this struct was to be able to inspect a header of a packet without having to blindly cast it to a request and only look at the fields I wanted to.. that seems "more wrong" than having a struct representing the header and allow to inspect all of the common fields (with another factory method for request or response depending on the magic byte)

Line:42, include/mcbp/protocol/header.h -> That's fine - I understand the use-case.

My concern is that a number of the fields are not "safe" to access directly as they are in the wrong endian. You've provided accessor functions for them (getKeyLen, etc) which is great, but that would suggest that the member variables themselves are kept non-public to ensure the object is not used incorrectly.

Personally I'd just add accessors for magic and opcode, and then you are done - you have a nice, consistent API which is always safe to use.
