DESCRIPTION:

Don't advance time in ep_unit_tests

ep-engine_ep_unit_tests should (generally) be fully deterministic,
unaffected by things like the external time. However they currently
use the mock_server's time functions, which are implemented using
gettimeofday(). As such, time /will/ advance inside the unit tests.

Fix this by adding a UnitTestServerCore implementation of
ServerCoreIface. This simply returns 0 for get_current_time().
