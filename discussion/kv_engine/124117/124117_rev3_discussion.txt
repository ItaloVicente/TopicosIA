DESCRIPTION:

MB-38356: Stream request for duplicate vbid stops streaming

If a DCP connection makes a stream request for a vbucket which it is
already streaming, then the second request should with KEY_EEXISTS,
and the initial stream remains as-is.

However, as part of changes for Collections to support multiple
StreamIDs for a single vBucket, this behaviour was regressed - the
KEY_EEXISTS is sent fine, however the initial stream incorrectly has
its cursor dropped (as the second essentially "steals" it). This
results in the initial stream hanging - no further mutations are sent
on it, even though it it still established.

Fix by splitting updateStreamsMap() into an initial check phase (which
will return the error /before/ creating a second ActiveStream) and a
subsequent update map phase.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> fail?

Line:372, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> second

Line:373, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> If we enter this block it means that vbid is already mapped in 'streams'.
So, don't we have to clear the add_vb_conn_map flag unconditionally here?

Line:373, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Need to double check if an extra call to 

    (line 577) engine_.getDcpConnMap().addVBConnByVBId(shared_from_this(), vbucket);

could cause any relevant issue, probably better to just avoid the call if unnecessary?

Line:372, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Copy/paste from original ;) I'll fix.

Line:373, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Well, this is the same logic as was present originally - it only clears add_vb_conn_map if a matching stream was found.

Note that "vb conn map" is a little misleading now - it can map multiple Streams for the same VB, which is the case here I believe.

@Ben care to comment?

Line:373, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Sure on the "multiple Streams for the same VB", that's exactly my point.
Imagine we already have an entry for {vbid: 0, sid:0}. Then we add {vbid:0, sid:1}.
In that case we don't clear the flag and we end up with calling DcpConnMap::addVBConnByVBId().
Not sure yet if that's bad or just a "logical NOP"

Line:373, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> In ConnStore it expects multiple calls and comments as such

   // For collections we will allow many streams for a given vBucket per
    // Producer. For this, bump the refCount of the VBConn with each new stream.
    if (itr == list.end()) {
        vbToConns[vbid.get()].emplace_back(VBConn{conn, 1});
    } else {
        itr->refCount++;
    }

Line:373, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> ConnStore stuff is not present in MadHatter branch (6.5.1 included) so we don't need to worry about that (although it should fully support this).

In the "old" MH and earlier way of doing things it's erquired to call ConnMap::addVBConnByVbid provided we have different stream IDs. Otherwise we will remove weak_ptrs from vbConns and eventually find that one does not exist that we expect to. However, I wouldn't expect that any of this ever happens as no other components support collections (for DP) in MH (and send stream ids).

Looks fine to me.
