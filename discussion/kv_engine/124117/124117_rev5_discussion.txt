DESCRIPTION:

MB-38356: Stream request for duplicate vbid stops streaming

If a DCP connection makes a stream request for a vbucket which it is
already streaming, then the second request should fail with
KEY_EEXISTS, and the initial stream remains as-is.

However, as part of changes for Collections to support multiple
StreamIDs for a single vBucket, this behaviour was regressed - the
KEY_EEXISTS is sent fine, however the initial stream incorrectly has
its cursor dropped (as the second essentially "steals" it). This
results in the initial stream hanging - no further mutations are sent
on it, even though it it still established.

Fix by splitting updateStreamsMap() into an initial check phase (which
will return the error /before/ creating a second ActiveStream) and a
subsequent update map phase.
