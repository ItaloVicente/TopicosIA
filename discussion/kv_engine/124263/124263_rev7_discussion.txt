DESCRIPTION:

MB-36373: Add BackgroundCompact StorageProperty

Magma does not allow explicit compactions to run concurrently with
writes. It instead performs implicit (background) compactions to deal
with fragmentation. This is subtly different from the
ConcurrentWriteCompact StorageProperty so add a new BackgroundCompact
StorageProperty to identify this that will be used in a future patch.
