DESCRIPTION:

[dcpdrain] Add support for draining over TLS

Add support for --tls (and authentication via certificates)
to dcpdrain to allow to check the throughput when using
TLS.

@todo it won't currently work under cluster_run as we
need to pick out the correct port number from the
cccp payload.
