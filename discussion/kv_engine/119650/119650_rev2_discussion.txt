DESCRIPTION:

MB-37330: Correct expelling logic for items with same seqno

The checkpoint expelling code can fail to expel an item from a
Checkpoint if there's only 1 candidate item to expel.

The issue is the logic in the expel code which attempts to ensure that
items with the same seqno are not partially expelled - i.e. we should
expel either all or none of items sharing the same seqno.  This is
done by adjusting the chosen expel cursor backwards (initially set to
the earliest cursor) if it points to an invalid position - from the
code:

    /*
     * Walk backwards over the checkpoint if not yet reached the dummy item,
     * and pointing to an item that either:
     * 1. has a seqno equal to the checkpoint's high seqno, or
     * 2. has a previous entry with the same seqno, or
     * 3. is pointing to a metadata item.
     */
    while ((iterator != oldestCheckpoint->begin()) &&
            (((*iterator)->getBySeqno() ==
              int64_t(oldestCheckpoint->getHighSeqno())) ||
             ((*std::prev(iterator))->getBySeqno() ==
              (*iterator)->getBySeqno()) ||
             ((*iterator)->isCheckPointMetaItem()))) {
        --iterator;
    }

The intent here is correct, however the specifics are slightly wrong.
Consider the following example - note the oldest (only) cursor is pointing at mutation:1002:

    empty  checkpoint_start  mutation  mutation
    1001   1001              1001      1002
                                       ^
                                       Cursor

The while loop is executed and the first clause is true - Cursor is
pointing at the high seqno (we cannot expel the last item in a
checkpoint, must always leave at least one item). The cursor is
correctly decremented:

    empty  checkpoint_start  mutation  mutation
    1001   1001              1001      1002
                             ^
                             Cursor

This should be where the cursor stops - it is safe to expel everything
from the Cursor backwards (inclusive), given that wouldn't leave some
items with the same seqno expelled.

However, clause (2) checks if the previous item
(checkpoint_start:1001) shares the same seqno as the current item
(mutation:1001). This is true, and the cursor _is_ decremented.  The
same thing happens again for the next position (empty:1001 and
checkpoint_start:1001) and hence the cursor ends up at the start of
the checkpoint and nothing is expelled:

    empty  checkpoint_start  mutation  mutation
    1001   1001              1001      1002
    ^
    Cursor

What should have happened is the seqno of the current item should be
compared with the next item (mutation:1001 and mutation:1002), which
is false and hence the iterator should have stopped when pointing at
mutation:1001.

Fix by adjusting the clause in the while loop to compare current with
next.

However, doing so exposes a previously benign bug in the oldest cursor
selection.

The oldest cursor is found by using std::min_element() on the list of
cursors, comparing their checkpointId and seqno:

    const auto compareByCkptAndSeqno = [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {
        return a.second->getCkptIdAndSeqno() <
               b.second->getCkptIdAndSeqno();
    };

    auto earliestCursor = std::min_element(
            cursors.begin(), cursors.end(), compareByCkptAndSeqno);

The bug is that two cursors which have the same CkptId and Seqno are
not ordered, so the wrong (not earliest) one could be selected. This
was benign due to the above next/prev bug - the cursor would be moved
backwards to the earliest item with the same seqno and so the bug was
harmless. Howver with the expel issue fixed, that is no longer the case.

Address this by additionally sorting on the cursors' distance from the
start of the container if their ckptId and seqnos are identical.

I don't know - possibly not, but I wanted to do the minimal change here to fix the issue. Note that metadata items are always small - none apart from set_vbucket_state has a value, so the benefit of expelling them is pretty minimal.
