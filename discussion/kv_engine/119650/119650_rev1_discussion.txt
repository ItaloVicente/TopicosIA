DESCRIPTION:

MB-37330: Correct expelling logic for items with same seqno

The checkpoint expelling code can fail to expel an item from a
Checkpoint if there's only 1 candidate item to expel.

The issue is the logic in the expel code which attempts to ensure that
items with the same seqno are not partially expelled - i.e. we should
expel either all or none of items sharing the same seqno.  This is
done by adjusting the chosen expel cursor backwards (initially set to
the earliest cursor) if it points to an invalid position - from the
code:

    /*
     * Walk backwards over the checkpoint if not yet reached the dummy item,
     * and pointing to an item that either:
     * 1. has a seqno equal to the checkpoint's high seqno, or
     * 2. has a previous entry with the same seqno, or
     * 3. is pointing to a metadata item.
     */
    while ((iterator != oldestCheckpoint->begin()) &&
            (((*iterator)->getBySeqno() ==
              int64_t(oldestCheckpoint->getHighSeqno())) ||
             ((*std::prev(iterator))->getBySeqno() ==
              (*iterator)->getBySeqno()) ||
             ((*iterator)->isCheckPointMetaItem()))) {
        --iterator;
    }

The intent here is correct, however the specifics are slightly wrong.
Consider the following example - note the oldest (only) cursor is pointing at mutation:1002:

    empty  checkpoint_start  mutation  mutation
    1001   1001              1001      1002
                                       ^
                                       Cursor

The while loop is executed and the first clause is true - Cursor is
pointing at the high seqno (we cannot expel the last item in a
checkpoint, must always leave at least one item). The cursor is
correctly decremented:

    empty  checkpoint_start  mutation  mutation
    1001   1001              1001      1002
                             ^
                             Cursor

This should be where the cursor stops - it is safe to expel everything
from the Cursor backwards (inclusive), given that wouldn't leave some
items with the same seqno expelled.

However, clause (2) checks if the previous item
(checkpoint_start:1001) shares the same seqno as the current item
(mutation:1001). This is true, and the cursor _is_ decremented.  The
same thing happens again for the next position (empty:1001 and
checkpoint_start:1001) and hence the cursor ends up at the start of
the checkpoint and nothing is expelled:

    empty  checkpoint_start  mutation  mutation
    1001   1001              1001      1002
    ^
    Cursor

What should have happened is the seqno of the current item should be
compared with the next item (mutation:1001 and mutation:1002), which
is false and hence the iterator should have stopped when pointing at
mutation:1001.

Fix by adjusting the clause in the while loop to compare current with
next.

However, doing so exposes a previously benign bug in the oldest cursor
selection.

The oldest cursor is found by using std::min_element() on the list of
cursors, comparing their checkpointId and seqno:

    const auto compareByCkptAndSeqno = [](const auto& a, const auto& b) {
        return a.second->getCkptIdAndSeqno() <
               b.second->getCkptIdAndSeqno();
    };

    auto earliestCursor = std::min_element(
            cursors.begin(), cursors.end(), compareByCkptAndSeqno);

The bug is that two cursors which have the same CkptId and Seqno are
not ordered, so the wrong (not earliest) one could be selected. This
was benign due to the above next/prev bug - the cursor would be moved
backwards to the earliest item with the same seqno and so the bug was
harmless. Howver with the expel issue fixed, that is no longer the case.

Address this by additionally sorting on the cursors' distance from the
start of the container if their ckptId and seqnos are identical.

Seems all good to me, letting Dan to give a look.

What I get is:
  1) We don't want to expel some items but not others with the same seqno
  2) We used to solve it by /not/ expelling anything when some items share the same seqno
  3) Now with this change we solve it by the opposite way, ie we ensure that we expel /all/ the items that share the same seqno

It appears that point (2) was the only reason for not expelling metaitems.
Is my understanding correct?
Was there any other reason for not expelling metaitems? I cannot think of any..
Line:1968, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> It would be nice to check what exactly we are expelling, ie checking the content of the checkpoint-list before/after the expel.

Line:1968, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> True, but I think for this simple test it's of limited value - we know there's only 4 things in the checkpoint, and we know we always expel from the beginning, so if we expelled 2 things then it's obvious what they are.
