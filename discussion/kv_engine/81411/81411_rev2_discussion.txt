DESCRIPTION:

MB-25371: Hack to work around privilege failures for ns_server

I have a few thoughts about the problem

1) ns_server don't implement xerror, so they end up getting
   disconnected on all new errors (like AUTH STALE)
2) ns_server don't handle very well that a connection is
   disconnected (at least that's what I've been told.. I
   don't know if thats true anymore)
3) ns_server don't "synchronize" the logic for its connections..
   one task may update the rbac database, one task may delete the
   bucket, one task may still do dcp stuff.
   Memcached don't really know (and shouldn't care) about this.
   When the RBAC database is changed we should reflect that.
   That means that the DCP connections would loose the access
   to the named bucket immediately if the rbac database say so.
   That could result in a new error code, and as described in
   1 that means a disconnect.

This patch adds a hack that we don't even consult the RBAC
database for connections authenticated as "@ns_server" but grants
all access.

Creating such users should _not_ be possible in our system as
@ is listed as an invalid character for users (that's why we chose
to use it in our internal users). Note that this is a temporary hack
and if this turns out to be the problem ns_server needs to fix the
code so that it can run with the configuration it provides memcached.
