DESCRIPTION:

MB-30865: [3/n] Minor improvements to leb128

1) Add some simple methods in the style of std
  begin()/end()/data()/size()

Removes the need for .get().size()

2) Calculate maxSize based on the template type to
reduce the size of the object for smaller types.

3). Improved encoding method. The old method was entering
the loop and shifting for 0 encode and the while loop
seems a little more readable - and better for anyone
copying the code into python...
