As a general comment, having all the code for Pipe in the header makes it harder to profile, as everything will get inlined can you can't associate the actual Pipe method's costs to themselves.

You might want to consider de-inlining some of the larger methods (e.g. ensureCapacity) when you come to profile this again.
Line:511, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Is this comment accurate? I don't see any packing here.

Line:789, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> This is a subtle change - maybe make this in a later patch in case it's having an effect?

Line:511, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> yes and no.. it happens implicitly as part of 522 if we at the end...  I'll just nuke the comment as it is only confusing

Line:789, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> This change isn't strictly needed anymore (before I discovered why DCP wasn't working I had conn_new_command cleaned up the rest of the previous command as well). now all of the buffer juggeling of the input buffers happens in conn_execute.
