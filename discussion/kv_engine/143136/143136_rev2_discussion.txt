DESCRIPTION:

MB-43055: Cleanup dead code in ItemPager::run

The cherry-pick in 0df2087be
http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/142986

backported a fix ensuring the ItemPager did not early exit _after_
setting the `available` flag to false. However, the cherry pick did not
remove the old early exit (while the original patch did do so).

 bool ItemPager::run() {
    ...
    if (current <= lower) {
		...  // This early exit is correct, _before_ changing available
        return true;
    }
    ....
    if ((current > upper) || doEvict || wasNotified) {
        bool inverse = true;
        if (!(*available).compare_exchange_strong(inverse, false)) {...}
    ....
    if (current <= lower) {
		...  // This early exit is no longer reachable
        return true;
	}

As they have the same condition, the second early exit is now dead
code, and does not affect the correctness of the pager behaviour.

Remove it for cleanliness and consistency with other branches.

Might as well keep this change as a cleanup.

Still investigating the test failure. Confirmed the unit test does still guard against the original issue, and local repros behave as expected. Investigating if this is a test issue, and why it would differ across branches.
