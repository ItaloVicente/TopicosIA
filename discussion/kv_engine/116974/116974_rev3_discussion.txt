DESCRIPTION:

MB-35308: Move hps on non durable writes

To allow ns_server to only check the HPS when deciding which replica
should be promoted, make the HPS move on non-durable writes too. They
would otherwise have to consider both the HPS and the high seqno when
deciding which replica ought to be promoted.
