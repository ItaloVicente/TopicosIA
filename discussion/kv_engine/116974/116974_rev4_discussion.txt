DESCRIPTION:

MB-35308: Move hps on non durable writes

To allow ns_server to only check the HPS when deciding which replica
should be promoted, make the HPS move on non-durable writes too. They
would otherwise have to consider both the HPS and the high seqno when
deciding which replica ought to be promoted.

(11 comments)
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Nit: HPS

Line:1326, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> We never need the item in it's smart-ptr owned form; sufficient to just pass by `const Item&`.

Line:1334, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Might be worth a brief comment explaining the logic here.

Line:34, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.h -> Please also update this comment to include details on the extra seqno tracked for non-sync writes.

Similary for passive DM.

Line:98, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> Not sure "post prepare HPS" is the best name for this. See if you can think of something more obvious / clearer to the reader.

Line:118, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> I think it's worth expanding this comment a bit, explaining exactly why SyncWrite has this secondary sequence number associated with it.

Line:225, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Suggest also explaining why it's ok to essentially ignore this item if trackedWrites is empty.

Line:541, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> I don't think "non-prepare" is good terminology here - strictly speaking that could be an abort, commit, etc.

"non-SyncWrite" is probably better.

Line:780, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> If ?

Line:1217, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I think we should try to avoid locking this for all mutations, if no SyncWrites has occurred on this vBucket (otherwise we'll slow down non-SyncWrite workloads).

Maybe check if the highPreparedSeqno is non-zero or similar?

Line:1232, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Comment needs updating.

Line:1326, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Function's name is misleading, before looking at the implementation I thought that we were adding a non-SW for tracking :)

Line:118, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> I understand how you use this but still not sure why we need the extra member.
Can't we just update the State::highPreparedSeqno in both ADM and PDM (when it's time to do that, ie at snap-boundaries + other conditions verified) ?
Looking more in depth into this though

Line:1326, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> done :)

Line:118, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> We wouldn't know what to update State::HPS to when it's appropriate without this member.

Consider a prepare that requries persistence followed by some number of non durable writes then another prepare that requires persistence. If we flush the first then we have logically prepared it and can move the HPS past it. But what do we move it to? If we have flushed the second prepare too then it's easy, we set it to the seqno of the second prepare. If we haven't flushed the second prepare though then we need to know what value to set the HPS to.

One alternative I considered was moving it to the seqno of the next prepare that can't be advanced over - 1, but given a replica could skip this seqno due to dedupe in the CheckpointManager (or disk I suppose) I didn't want to set the HPS to a value that we may not have seen.

Line:1217, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> If we call addNonSyncWrite/notifyNonPrepare(new name) out of our seqno order we'll start throwing monotonic exceptions on the postPrepareHPS/desiredHPS seqno.

Could leave it until it's proven an issue as the code will be more complicated
