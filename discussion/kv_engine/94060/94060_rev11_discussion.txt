DESCRIPTION:

Minimise config.h includes

Remove includes from config.h which arn't really
configuration-related, nor handling platform abstraction. If source
files need libevent, or socket functionality they should include it
themselves.

One of the intentions initially was to get rid of all of the #ifdef's in all of the source files and hide away all of the differences there. Given to what we're left with is for socket handling, I'm tempted to:

a) add those #ifdef's in platform/socket.h (which they'll need anyway to use sockets)
b) do like we've done for other headers, and create "dummy" files for windows in
http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/platform/include/win32/
(which could end up in including winsock2.h
Line:59, config.cmake.h -> we could probably nuke this as well...

Line:45, daemon/connection.cc -> these comments will be obsolete relatively quickly...

Line:59, config.cmake.h -> I think they were still in use when I started this patch (it'e been rebased / revisited a few times in the last few weeks)!

edit: just checked and it's still used in daemon/connection.cc

Line:45, daemon/connection.cc -> true, but given this is platform-specific (!WIN32) thought it would be helpful to document why we only include on some platforms.

Sounds reasonable.

However this patch has been a PITA to merge as it touches loads of stuff and had to rebase a bunch of times. I'd like to get it in as-is (given IMHO it's a definite improvement), any further cleanup can be done in a seperate patch.

SGTM
Line:59, config.cmake.h -> I selected the wrong part ;) I was thinking about __need_IOV_MAX ;)

See what I mean ;) I'll rebase.
