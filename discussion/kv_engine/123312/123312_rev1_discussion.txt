DESCRIPTION:

MB-38173: Track key allocations as part of checkpoint overhead

Currently we are tracking checkpoint memory overhead as size of the
Checkpoint plus the amount of memory allocated in the keyIndex map plus
the amount of memory in the toWrite queue. If we have expelled all
items then the only substantial memory allocation will be the keyIndex.

An oversight was made when adding the tracking of the keyIndex such
that we do not track any heap memory allocations of keys
(std::strings). Add an "AllocatorTracked"DocKey to allow us to track
the heap allocations of keys in the checkpoint indexes.

Line:31, engines/ep/src/allocator_tracked_doc_key.h -> Is this extra class necessary? Can't we just add an extra  'Allocator' template parameter to StoredDocKey which defaults to the default allocator of std::string, and change StoredDocKey::keydata to be:

 std::basic_string<chatr, char_traits<char>, Allocator> keydata;

?

Line:241, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> This is a bit complex :( - and we are creating a temporary std::string object just to do the find() :((

The polymorphic allocators in C++17 should help to fix this, but obviously mad-hatter isn't C++17...

I'm not sure I can think of anything better though...

Line:31, engines/ep/src/allocator_tracked_doc_key.h -> Possibly. My first attempt at doing this was just to template StoredDocKey but had some issues converting between StoredDocKeys and other types as the keydata types didn't match up. Was easier to just do this separately at first and then I forgot to try templating StoredDocKey again.

Will look into it

Line:241, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Yeah and that temporary gets tracked in the overhead too :(

Line:31, engines/ep/src/allocator_tracked_doc_key.h -> Tiny bit of header creep wth some leb stuff. Could work around that with some explicit template instantiations but that looked awful. http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/123313/
