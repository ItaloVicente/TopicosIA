DESCRIPTION:

MB-37748: Shared locking for bucket Collection::Manifest

Primary change was to change the Collection::Manger mutex to be
a shared lock so that concurrent readers don't have to serialise
around a read.

As part of that change is the removal of the "no-manifest" state,
the Manager will always construct a Manifest, and this Manifest
is in the initial collection state, that is:

    uid:0
    scopes:[_default]
    collections[_default]

This makes the Manager job a little easier as it can assume a Manifest
is always available, there maybe a small window on node startup where
the node appears to be behind the cluster, but this part of the collection
design, tolerating a node being behind the true bucket state.

Note the no-manifest error code has not been removed yet, MB-37781 will
track it, we will either use it or lose it, but decide that later.
