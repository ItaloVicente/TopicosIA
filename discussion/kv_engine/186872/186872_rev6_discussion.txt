DESCRIPTION:

MB-55557: CDC History scan requires a map of the open collections

With CDC enabled a collection drop doesn't currently have any ability
to fully purge the collection, if the dropped collection spans into
the history window, and the collection has historic data, the older
versions remain in the history window, yet the collection is deemed
dropped (it is no longer in open of dropped collection lists).

When the DCP backfill runs, it transmits these "logically deleted"
items as they are by the Collections::ScanContext logic "alive". This
causes an unknown collection error on the consumer.

The fix for this issue is to enhance the Collections::ScanContext class
so it can use both the set of dropped collections (required) and
optionally be given the set of open collections for deciding what items
are dropped.

The logic becomes:

1) If key@seqno is in the seqno range of dropped collections (and is
in the set of dropped collections) => isLogicallyDeleted is true

Else

2) If the object was created with the list of open collections, the
key@seqno is now checked to see if

2.1) Not in the set of open collections => isLogicallyDeleted is true
2.2) In the set of open collections and seqno < start-seqno
     => isLogicallyDeleted is true

Else the item is deemed alive (in the set and > start-seqno)

Line:38, /COMMIT_MSG -> Just to be sure I've fully understood - this means we _will_ stream historical mutations from a given collection, up until the point the collection was dropped?

e.g.

- Collection created at seqno 10; mutations occur seqnos 11,12,13; collection dropped at seqno 20.
- User creates a CDC DCP stream across seqnos 10-19
- User will see collection creation; mutations at seqno 11,12,13 as alive docs

?

Line:38, /COMMIT_MSG -> Generally yes - in this case it's all about if the snapshot stores the drop event.

* Yes: Then we've always hidden all items of the collection
* No: Then we'll stream them, and we'll reach the drop event which will be in-memory.

So your example depends on where those mutations+drop-event exist. If they're all in the snapshot, they're 'hidden' by the ScanContext::isLogicallyDeleted, else they're visible until the drop is persisted.

That's the pre-CDC behaviour and the same is the aim (if this commit is the only issue) with CDC

Line:38, /COMMIT_MSG -> Thanks.

I'm not sure this is the desired behaviour for CDC (disk) snapshots.

Prior to CDC, we said that (disk) snapshots were only consistent at the end of the snapshot, due to potential reordering due to de-dupe (the classic A-B-A problem).

As such, for a snapshot we could legitimately omit all mutations for a given collection _if_ the collection was dropped somewhere before the end of the collection - as only once the last seqno of the snapshot had been processed was there a valid state to expose to downstream entities - and by that point the collection no longer exists.

However,CDC snapshots are consistent at any point - if they were not then it wouldn't make any sense to ever include multiple changes to the same key.

As such, I think in the mentioned scenario where the collection is dropped in the middle of the snapshot, we should include all mutations to that collection up to that point.

If we don't, then we have somewhat defeated the objective of Change Data Capture - we are discarding (potentially many) changes to a document, just before the collection is dropped.

Line:38, /COMMIT_MSG -> Created https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-55691 to track a broader solution to better support drop+history (although we will need to gather requirements from PM/customer) 

Let me know if there's any change required here.
