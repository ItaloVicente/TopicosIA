DESCRIPTION:

MB-26476 Indicate the flusher task completed after updating stats

The 'seqno stats' test in the 'ep_testsuite' fails intermittently
when it checks the 'last_persisted_seqno' for a VBucket.
When we 'wait_for_flusher_to_settle', we wait for the
'EPStats.flusher_todo' to be equals to 0. But,
'KVBucket::flushVBucket()' updates the VBucket 'last_persisted_seqno'
after 'EPStats.flusher_todo' has been set to 0.
To fix, we set 'EPStats.flusher_todo = 0' only after that
'last_persisted_seqno' has been updated.
