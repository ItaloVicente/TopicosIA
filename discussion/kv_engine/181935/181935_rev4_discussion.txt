DESCRIPTION:

MB-53859: Track if collection disk size was updated by an op

A later patch will use this information to determine if the disk size
stat needs updating if the value is compressed.

This avoids duplicating logic (e.g., is this a tombstone, is this a
system event?) and reduces the likelihood of introducing an
inconsistency down the line.
