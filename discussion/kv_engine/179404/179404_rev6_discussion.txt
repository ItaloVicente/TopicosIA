DESCRIPTION:

MB-53531: Make accessing KVBucket::ckptDestroyerTasks entries safer

Core change is that KVBucket::getCkptDestroyerTask() returns a
std::shared_ptr<> to Task rather than a raw reference.
That way the caller takes ownership of the object and can access it
safely regardless of any concurrent change to the
KVBucket::ckptDestroyerTasks struct.
