DESCRIPTION:

MB-44349: Use 'failed' error instead of disconnecting

Use of a new/extended error results in ns_server being disconnected (as
no xerror support) This has further consequences, such as the inability
for the detection of commit failure.

Switch over to using the generic 'failed' error when
cannot_apply_collections_manifest cannot be used, instead of
disconnecting.
