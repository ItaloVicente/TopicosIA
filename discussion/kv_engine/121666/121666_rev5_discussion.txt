DESCRIPTION:

MB-36379: Limit memcached to configured number of file descriptors

Now that we have the number of file descriptors available to us and
the percentage of file descriptors allocated to the engine we can
update our calculation for the number of max connections (file
descriptors) that memcached is allowed.
