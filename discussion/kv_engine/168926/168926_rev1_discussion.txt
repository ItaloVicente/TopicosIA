DESCRIPTION:

MB-50395 Fix MicrosecondHistogram printing

MicrosecondHistogram printing doesn't work correctly for timings greater
than 100 seconds.

Right now it prints:
      67108ms -   13s : ( 98.9755%)   694
      13s -   26s     : ( 99.9235%)   620
      26s -   53s     : (100.0000%)    50

After fix:
      67108ms - 134s : ( 98.9755%)   694
      134s -   268s  : ( 99.9235%)   620
      268s -   536s  : (100.0000%)    50

Some test cases for function time_label:
    print(time_label(100)) # 100us
    print(time_label(10000)) # 10000us
    print(time_label(1000*1000)) # 1000ms
    print(time_label(10*1000*1000)) # 10000ms
    print(time_label(600*1000*1000)) # 600s
    print(time_label(605000000)) # 10m:05s
