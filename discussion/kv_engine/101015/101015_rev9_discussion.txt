DESCRIPTION:

MB-31739: [2/2] Update create/drop system events per design changes

The create event needs to transmit
* manifest uid
* collection uid
* scope uid
* collection ttl (which is optional)
* collection name

The drop event needs only to transmit
* manifest uid
* collection uid

A DCP consumer can then correctly track the entire collection
manifest using this data.

The optional max_ttl is handled by having different versions of the
create collection event, so we can cleanly trasmit the different
sized structures.

These updates are achieved by updating the flatbuffer schema and
allowing the extra data (name and ttl) to be passed through
existing layers that join collections changes to DCP.

Note that we are storing and transmitting a maxTtl, but the Manifest
does not yet accept a max_ttl field and the max_ttl values themselves
aren't applied to Items.

Line:120, docs/dcp/documentation/commands/system_event.md -> docs/BinaryProtocol.md also needs updating with this opcode

Line:167, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Do we not need to pass the maxTtl into the system event too so that we actually store it?

Line:55, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_serialised_manifest_entry.fbs -> Nit: stores

Line:521, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.h -> Personally would comment what each size relates to (by_seqno/event type/version) so that you don't have to lookup if not familiar

Line:570, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.h -> Could make this a TODO

Line:693, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.h -> Think this should be CreateWithMaxTtlEventDcpData

Oops, miss-clicked before. I think we also need a warmup test to check that the collection ttl is persisted and loaded properly

Line:167, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> The max-ttl is stored into the new SystemEvent when we serialise the manifest (populateWithSerialisedData).  The collectionName is subtly different because it's not stored in the manifest so has to go down via the parameters and finally gets placed into the mutatedName field of the flatbuffers data

Line:693, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.h -> The response message is always initialised from the non DCP struct, in this case CreateEventData stores a max ttl as a boost::optional

In the next patches I've added tests, in this patch there's no easy way to set the TTL - the following patches add support for Manifest to specify the value and then the DCP tests we have can be extended. http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/101229/1/engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc

The next patch is the best place for such a test as I can use existing tests to set a TTL using the TestManifest
