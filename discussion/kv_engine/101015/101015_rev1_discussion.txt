DESCRIPTION:

MB-31739: [2/n] Update create/drop system events per design changes

The create event needs to transmits
* manifest uid
* collection uid
* scope uid
* collection ttl
* collection name

The drop event needs only to transmit
* manifest uid
* collection uid

A DCP consumer can then correctly track the entire collection
manifest using this data.

These updates are simply achieved by updating the flatbuffers spec
so we can serialise more data and then refining the code which handles
events so that it does the correct thing for create vs drop.

Internally in the VB::Manifest we are also now storing a collection TTL,
however it is always 0 as the Manifest JSON code does not yet support
a ttl field.
