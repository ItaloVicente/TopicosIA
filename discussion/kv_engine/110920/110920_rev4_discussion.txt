DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Clean up magma API calls

Update the functions with correct TODO information.

Functions magma will not support.
getDbFileInfo
getAggrDbFileInfo
Magma does not keep track of DbFileInfo so it can't return it.

pendingTasks
Magma does not support the pendingTasks calls.

incrementRevision
Magma does not support file revisions

getDBFileId
Move to magma-kvstore.cc to avoid pulling in mcbp/protocol/request.h
Pull the Vbid from the request.

discoverVBuckets
Internal magma wrapper function no longer used.
