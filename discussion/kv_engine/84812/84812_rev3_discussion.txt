DESCRIPTION:

MB-26470: Use shared/weak ptr for Stream and ActiveStream objs.

Currently we use SingleThreadedRCPtr for Stream and ActiveStream
objs that are shared across multiple modules. This can lead to
cyclic references and hence memory leak.

This commit uses std::shared_ptr and std::weak_ptr to overcome
the problem of cyclic reference.

I'd be tempted to break this change into two parts - the first moves from RCPtr to shared_ptr (but without fixing the cyclic reference) - i.e. just a straight refactor.

The second would fix the actual circular reference using weak_ptr.

Please check all your instances of passing shared_ptr - they should confirm to the guidelines about in: http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-sharedptrparam-owner
Line:154, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill-manager.cc -> Passing a shared_ptr by const reference is unusual - const implies that it isn't modified, but in that case it would be preferred to pass via a raw reference if the "smartness" of the ptr isn't relevant here.

If you don't change the refcount of this object then prefer a const&; if you do change the ref-count then pass a non-const shared_ptr&.

See guidelines R.34 and R.36 - http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-sharedptrparam-owner

Line:63, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill.h -> How often to we call this method? If it's infrequent, it might be a premature optimisation to cache the vbid.

Line:73, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill.h -> Now we are converting weak to shared ptrs I think this should be made non0inline and moved to .cc

Line:84, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill.h -> Probably worth expanding this comment to explain why we use a weak ptr here.

Line:85, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill.h -> No need to put `weak` in the variable name - the type of the variable already tells us that.

Line:158, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> This means little (or nothing!) to people outside KV-Engine. Try to re-phrease to it expresses /why/ and /what/ has failed, not the details of the /how/.

Line:241, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.cc -> Should be DCPBackfillDisk

Line:46, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.h -> As previous; I don't think you need to rename this; but it would be useful to describe why it's a weak ptr.

Line:57, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill_disk.h -> ditto

Line:896, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> I think it's safer to do this casting the other way around - i.e. change `queue` to be of type shared_ptr<ActiveStream>, and cast the type on the way in using dynamic cast - that way the queue is guaranteed to only contain ActiveStream objects; and you remove the need for the case here (and the null check).

Line:51, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> Can you remove RCValue from Stream now? (if all places which used to user our SingleThreadedRCPtr now use shared_ptr?)

Line:537, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> This could be null (if the lock fails). Are you handling that correctly when you return it - i.e would callers be happy with a null return value?

Line:563, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> Please document what this `int` is for.

Line:1129, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> You should check the result of all dynamic_casts (especially in test code).

Commit split into 2. In this commit, I only covert RCPtr to shared_ptr.
In the subsequent commit will use weak_ptr.
Line:154, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill-manager.cc -> Done

Line:63, engines/ep/src/dcp/backfill.h -> This is needed for debug logs when we use a weak ptr to the stream and the stream is null prematurely

Line:896, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Done

Line:51, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> We still need this because PassiveStream still uses RCPtr

Line:1129, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Done
