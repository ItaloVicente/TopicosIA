DESCRIPTION:

MB-26470: Use shared ptr for Stream and ActiveStream objs.

Currently we use SingleThreadedRCPtr for Stream and ActiveStream
objs that are shared across multiple modules. This can lead to
cyclic references and hence memory leak.

This commit changes all SingleThreadedRCPtr for Stream and ActiveStream
to std::shared_ptr and hence sets up the ground to use std::weak_ptr
that would finally get rid of cyclic references.
