DESCRIPTION:

MB-34628 [1/2] SR: Avoid recursive locking of collection Manifest lock

When performing mutations with durability requirements (SyncWrites),
the VBuckets' collection manifest lock is acquired (in shared mode)
recursively.

This causes lock ordering problems with a forthcoming change to avoid
SyncWrites being committed in the wrong order, as we end up creating a
cycle in lock ordering. Current lock ordering (before this patch is):

    * KVBucket:set (also add, replace...):
      LOCK VB::Manifest
          * VBucket::set()
              * ActiveDM::addSyncWrite()
                LOCK ActiveDM::State
                ...
                UNLOCK ActiveDM::State
              * ActiveDM::checkForCommit()
                ... get set of SyncWrites to commit...
                for (item : toCommit) {
                    LOCK VB::Manfest <=== RECURSIVE LOCK
                    * VB::commit()
                    UNLOCK VB::Manifest
                }

Note that VB::Manifest it locked recursively inside VB::commit() in
the above sequence.  Currently the above doesn't cause any problems
(however in general recursive locking can be tricky to debug), but
with the needed change to commit items in order, the above changes to:

    * KVBucket:set (also add, replace...):
      LOCK VB::Manifest
          * VBucket::set()
              * ActiveDM::addSyncWrite()
                LOCK ActiveDM::State
                ...
                UNLOCK ActiveDM::State
              * ActiveDM::checkForCommit()
    NEW         LOCK ActiveDM::completedQueue
                ... get set of SyncWrites to commit...
                for (item : toCommit) {
                    LOCK VB::Manfest <=== LOCK CYCLE with ActiveDM::completedQueue
                    * VB::commit()
                    UNLOCK VB::Manifest
                }

Note how the second lock of VB::Manifest (recursively, in the same
thread) now forms a cycle with the new ActiveDM::completedQueue lock
which is needed to serialise the calls to VB::commit.

To avoid this cycle when ActiveDM::completedQueue is introduced,
remove the recursive locking by moving checkForCommit to outside
VBucket::set(), after VB::Manifest is unlocked:

    * KVBucket:set (also add, replace...):
      LOCK VB::Manifest
          * VBucket::set()
              * ActiveDM::addSyncWrite()
                LOCK ActiveDM::State
                ...
                UNLOCK ActiveDM::State
      UNLOCK VB::Manifest
          * ActiveDM::checkForCommit()
    NEW     LOCK ActiveDM::completedQueue
            ... get set of SyncWrites to commit...
            for (item : toCommit) {
                UNLOCK VB::Manifest
                * VB::commit()
                LOCK VB::Manfest
            }
