DESCRIPTION:

MB-55530 Expose compaction, checkpoint, filter stats

It is helpful to know the breakdown of total compactions done between
key index and seq index.

Bloom filter hit/miss lets us track its false positive rate.

CheckpointOverhead gives a measure of disk fragmentation due to keeping
older checkpoints in Magma.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> At a glance these stats aren't discussed in the MB; are these relevant for testing/debuggability?

If so, might be worth noting that for future gerrit archaeology to note how they relate (e.g., if ever a different patch for that MB needed reverting, it'd be clear that this does/does not require reverting too and so on)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The compaction, checkpoint related stats are relevant for the MB. That MB affects the triggering of compactions. So helpful to know if it has made compacts more aggressive/relaxed. We may include checkpoint overhead into our fragmentation calculations as well hence exposed it. I'll put this as a comment on the MB too. 

The bloom filter stat is not related, but since it is a tiny one, I thought I'll add it along here. Was recently required when DaveR was investigating a CBSE. Hope it is ok to include it herein.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Roger, thanks for clarifying about the compaction/checkpoint stats.

Mmmm, generally it's nice to keep changes separated by purpose; sneaking it in here "gets round" the restriction checker but in general makes for a harder history to follow/makes future reverts more complex (imagining "I reverted these patches for this MB because it introduced regression X, but that silently removed this unrelated stat? Do I separately re-add that stat, or undo the actual changes that need reverting but not as a straight git revert?")

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Sure, I've removed the bloom filter stat. Also updated the commit message to better reflect on how it helps with debugging the MB.
