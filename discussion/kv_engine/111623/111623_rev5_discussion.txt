DESCRIPTION:

MB-34918: Acquire read-lock for KVBucket::stateLock

The stateLock should be held when running operations in
the vbucket to ensure that the vbucket don't change state
while we're in the middle of executing code in there.

The issue was found as part of code inspection for the
following methods:

   KVBucket::evictKey
   KVBucket::getRandomKey
   KVBucket::getLocked
   KVBucket::unlockKey
   KVBucket::getKeyStats
   KVBucket::deleteItem
