DESCRIPTION:

MB-41510: Fix infinite loop due to HdrHistogram being reset

Currently if a HdrHistogram has its reset() method called by one thread
(T1) and is being read by another (T2) using an HdrHistoram::Iterator.
There is the race that could cause the HdrHistoram::Iterator() to enter
an infinite loop.

This occurs as HdrHistogram's getNextValue() methods use HdrHistogam_c's
hdr_iter_next() which intern uses the following function:
static bool has_next(struct hdr_iter* iter)
{
        return iter->cumulative_count < iter->total_count;
}
Which logically checks that the total count the Iterator was
initialize with is > than the sum of all the counts its read from the
buckets in the histogram. The trouble is, that the reset() method
changes the bucket counts back to 0. Thus, meaning the condition
cumulative_count >= total_count may never be met.

To fix this wrap the std::unique_ptr<struct hdr_histogram> with a
folly::Synchronized<>. This allows us to take an exclusive lock on the
pointer when performing a reset() of the histogram and allows us to
ensure that no iterator is reading from the histogram, as the iterator
takes a non exclusive read lock for the lifetime of the
HdrHistogram::Iterator struct. This also ensures that
HdrHistogram::resize() is thread safe as we now take a write lock.

I think you can simplify this quite a bit - see detailed comments.
Line:503, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hdrhistogram_test.cc -> Technically reset() can run anytime between creation and the join. 

If you want to guarantee that it runs while in the middle of the iteration, I think you should manually advance the iterator the appropriate number of times, then create (and join) the thread, then finish the iteration.

Line:24, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> This header doesn't appear used.

Line:44, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Not sure this type alias gives anything other than just an unnecessary level of indirection.

Line:58, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Firstly, there's already a type alias for this named `SharedMutexWritePriority` which would be clearer to use if that's what we wanted.

However, the default type is already writer priority, to this template parameter is entirely unnecessary.

Line:59, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> I believe you can simplify this to something like SyncHdrHistogramPtr::ConstRLockedPtr;

Line:90, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> You have a type alias for this - SyncHdrHistogramPtr.

Line:216, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Seems strange to require heap-allocation for the Iterator. What's the reason to use a unique_ptr here?

Line:398, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Note that folly::SynchronizedPtr<> is probably a better choice here as it makes it simpler to manipulate the pointed-to object.

Line:503, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hdrhistogram_test.cc -> resetThread() will be run as soon as its created, but the underlying hdr_reset() will not as it requires an exclusive lock, due to getHistogramsIterator() creating a read lock and holding onto it at the point of thread creation. I'll update my comments to reflect this.

Line:24, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Done

Line:44, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Done

Line:58, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Done

Line:59, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Done

Line:90, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> Done

Line:216, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> The copy constructor for Iterator can no longer be use as the lockPtr's copy constructor is deleted for obvious reasons.

Line:398, utilities/hdrhistogram.h -> As we use a lot of C functions we often need the raw ptr from the std::unique_ptr<>, unfortunately SynchronizedPtr<> make it quite difficult to do this.
E.g.
 hdr_add(thisRLockPtr->get(), otherRLockPtr->get());
Becomes
hdr_add(const_cast<struct hdr_histogram*>(thisRLockPtr.operator->()), otherRLockPtr.operator->());

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:503, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/hdrhistogram_test.cc -> Note the test as written is racy - at the moment there's no guarantee of any order, the thread may not actually get scheduled until after line 500 (and the iteration has finished).

I'm not sure there's a huge amount you can do (ideally you'd somehow wait until the reset thread was blocked waiting for exclusive access on the mutex, and only _then_ complete the iteration, but that isn't currently possible with the locking we use).
