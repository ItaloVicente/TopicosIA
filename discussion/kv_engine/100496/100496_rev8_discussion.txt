DESCRIPTION:

MB-30041: Add jsonGet function to json utilities

As part of MB-31599, we want to cleanup some of the error
messages output in audit. As we also wish to migrate to
nlohmann json and, where possible, use the raw nlohmann json
syntax. For simplicity, we are printing nlohmann json exceptions
for any json parsing errors. This is okay, but type errors do not
print the key of the object which we are testing.

Add a function that wraps around "nlohmann::json.get<T>()" that
catches the exceptions thrown and prepends the key to the exception
message so that end users can more easily identify issues in their
json configurations.

To keep syntax as simple as possible, this function should also
wrap the "nlohmann::json.at(key)" function, as our most common use
case is:
- "nlohmann::json.at(key).get<T>()"
These cases can then be replaced with:
- "cb::jsonGet<T>(nlohmann::json, key)"

Type errors using the pure nlohmann json method are as follows:
- "[json.exception.type_error.302] type must be <expectedType>,
 but is <actualType>"
Type errors using the cb::getJson function are as follows:
- "[json.exception.type_error.302] value for key "<key>" -
 type must be <expectedType>, but is <actualType>"

Line:48, utilities/json_utilities.h -> Do we already get a sensible what() message in the nlohmann exception thrown here?

Line:56, utilities/json_utilities.h -> This feels very brittle - if nlohmann::json changes their exception message then we could break here. I think it's safer to just prefix the whole nlohmann message with our extra message.

These exceptions are only expected to be consumed by internal people most of the time anyways; so they don't have to be perfectly pretty.

Line:48, utilities/json_utilities.h -> yeah, this one is fine. It prints the key for us in the exception

Line:56, utilities/json_utilities.h -> that's fair enough (I didn't like this solution but the alternative for making it look nice was demangling and then it's a platform issue).

I updated the commit message with the new exception format (prints the nlohmann exception type twice now). Could swap to std::invalid_argument if that's too weird looking instead of the nlohmann type exception but wanted to simplify usage so we only need to handle one type of exception

Line:56, utilities/json_utilities.h -> I'm happy to leave it this way (printing double)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:56, utilities/json_utilities.h -> If you really wanted to avoid the duplication you could do std::string::find / std::string::replace() on the expected prefix (if find() succeeded) - that would at least be robust to changes in the format - you'd just not find it and still print double. However given the fact this is for "our eyes only" it's probably overkill.
