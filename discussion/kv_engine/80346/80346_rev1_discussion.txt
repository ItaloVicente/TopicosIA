Line:845, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> You'll create a lot less code churn if you keep the the existing EPEngine::getReplicationThrottle() method and just change the implementation to chain down to the underlying bucket - i.e. have /it/ call getKVBucket()

Line:1189, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Style: In this instance (a method of KVBucket class) I'd argue it's clearer to just access the member variable directory - e.g.

 replicationThrottle->adjustWriteQueueCap(...);

That allows the reader to see it's just a direct member access without having to look at the source code for getReplicationThrottle, removing a layer of abstraction which doesn't really abstract anything useful for the reader.

Line:845, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Actually there is not much churn because of this. Just changes to 6 lines of code. And since this is a refactor commit, I think it is good to remove the replicationThrottle completely from the EPEngine obj

Line:1189, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Done

Line:845, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> I don't disagree with removing the replicationThrottle member var from EPEngine, I'm just saying keep the accessor method (but with a different implication) so we don't unnecessarily change users of the code.

DcpConsumer::drainStreamsBufferedItems shouldn't care how the underlying replicationThrottle is implemented.

(I find it helpful to think about Changes not as the end result, but the delta - aim to make the patch as small as possible and still achieve the required end result. That makes it much easier to review, and also in future when looking back at code makes it quicker to locate when a line was "really" changed.

In this case you've essentially "polluted" the history of line 845 in this file (and the similar thing in the other files) - you haven't made any change to the semantics of this line. Anyone in future who wants to - say find out when the replicationThrottle code was added - will have to jump past your no-op change here).

Line:845, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Ok, I agree it helps save the history correctly.. Will change
