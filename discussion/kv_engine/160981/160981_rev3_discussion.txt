Line:2720, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> NCompacts would include local index compactions as well. So it is good to have NCompacts, NCompacts_KeyIndex, NCompacts_SeqIndex.

> minimise stats overheads in prometheus

What is the overhead per stat? Is it due to increase in storage or transmission?

Line:2720, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> If the value NCompacts can be derived from KeyIndex and SeqIndex then indeed the Prometheus recommendation would be to drop the total and allow users to aggregate over the two "subtypes".

If it cannot be recalculated (i.e., if NCompacts != NCompacts_KeyIndex + NCompacts_SeqIndex) then it carries information that probably does warrant existing as a separate stat.

The primary concern is indeed storage overhead, KV has a lot of stats and as they grow it reduces how far back in time Prometheus can retain metrics before exceeding the configured size. The transmission overhead is indeed also worth bearing in mind, but for now that is a lesser concern.

Line:2720, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Thanks for the info James. 

Do we know roughly what is the storage space taken per stat value? That'll help us measure the savings we get by removing some stats.

Does it help to *not include* ep configuration that is static, for example: max_num_flushers. Not sure if Prometheus already handles constant values well and compresses it, in which case this only saves transmission overhead. 

> If it cannot be recalculated (i.e., if NCompacts != NCompacts_KeyIndex + NCompacts_SeqIndex) then it carries information that probably does warrant existing as a separate stat.

Yup that is the case here as NCompacts also includes local index compactions. So we'll need at least two subtypes here along with the total: KeyIndex, SeqIndex.

Line:2720, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Rohan, based on info I gathered for an MB a while back ( https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-45843?focusedCommentId=506264&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-506264 ) a rough rule of thumb for a lower bound would be around 2 bytes per sample per time series.

Each component has two Prometheus metrics endpoints, "/_prometheusMetrics" and "/_prometheusMetricsHigh" (corresponding to cb::prometheus::Cardinality::Low and High within KV). The "low" cardinality endpoint is scraped every 10 seconds, the "high" cardinality endpoint is scraped by default every 60s (IIRC), but this interval may be dynamically increased if ns_server projects that disk usage will exceed the limit before the desired retention period.

doEngineStatsMagma is called from EventuallyPersistentEngine::doEngineStatsLowCardinality, so a sample every 10 seconds.

Following the rule of thumb above, that's:

  2  bytes
 *6  per minute
 *60 per hour
 *24 per day

= 17280 ~= 17kB per day

 *31 per month

= 535680 ~= 0.5MB per month

Put into perspective that's not actually that high - it's the sheer quantity of time series we have that becomes problematic.


However,

> that is the case here as NCompacts also includes local index compactions. So we'll need at least two subtypes here along with the total: KeyIndex, SeqIndex.

I suspect ideally this would be exposed as 3 metrics in the same family, which can all be summed

(names for example only)

magma_num_compacts{index="local"}
magma_num_compacts{index="seq"}
magma_num_compacts{index="key"}

As this would be the easiest form to query (and add to a Grafana dashboard, etc).

Though that still assumes local, seq, and key compact counts are disjoint, and do give a meaningful total when summed.

Yup they make sense when summed like that.

One question, since the idea is to always derive the aggregate on the fly using Prometheus queries and not explicitly include a total stat - would that be inconvenient to other users who don't use Prometheus and will have to total up the stats themselves?

Line:2720, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Quite possibly yes - this is an unfortunate conflict that comes from having two main ways to get stats.

The simplest solution to that is to have the total, but not expose it for Prometheus stats declared with the CBSTAT macro will be skipped when gathering stats for Prometheus).

That's a good solution. I'll refactor.

I was concerned about Mortimer users who use Prometheus parsed stats, but just found out from Nithin that Mortimer supports saving expressions across cbcollects and restarts. So they should be good too.

> Rohan, based on info I gathered for an MB a while back 

Interesting findings on that MB. Seems the storage requirement also has a "similarity" factor. If a sample does not change in the time interval then the value is stored in a single bit.

If we find any Magma stat to be contributing significant storage overhead, we could review its importance later.

This is indeed correct - but as discussed in the MB even for a constant value, the timestamp can also be sizeable in certain circumstances (see https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-46675 for how KV tries to mitigate this).

Realistically a single time series has an upper bound on how much storage it can possibly require per scrape, and only dramatically (and constantly) changing metrics would ever approach that limit; information about compaction is likely to be useful enough to warrant its space usage 👍
