DESCRIPTION:

MB-48033: Create mutations from backfilled commits

SyncWrite code needs to be able to deal with mutations instead of
commits as a replica turning to active will have mutations rather
than commits (sent from the active). To save space, we can do two
things in a future patch:

1) Use the V1 couchstore metadata if commits are stored as mutations
2) Remove the operation field from the couchstore metadata (as we
   can differentiate between aborts, prepares, and mutations, by
   checking the key prefix and delete field).

Line:571, engines/ep/src/item.h -> Given this is only added for testing, I'd prefer if we could come up with some other way to do this - as currently `op` private and can only be changed via specific methods (which also update other dependant fields) - hence there's reasonably strong encapsulation of Item.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:571, engines/ep/src/item.h -> Done, made the test read from disk (rather than memory if available) to ensure the same state.
