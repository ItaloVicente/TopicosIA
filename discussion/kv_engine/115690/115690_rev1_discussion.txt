DESCRIPTION:

MB-36227: Make Producer and Consumer cache idleTimeout

Currently both the Producer and Consumer read the idleTimeout from
the configuration every time step is called on them. This requires
locking a mutex which is slow and cache contentions. Expand the
DcpConnMap valueChanged listener to update a cached config value on
each Producer/Consumer.
