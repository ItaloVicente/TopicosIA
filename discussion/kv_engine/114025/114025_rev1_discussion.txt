DESCRIPTION:

MB-35744 [SR]: Complete all resolved SyncWrites on vbState change

+Problem+

If a vbucket is changed from active when there are SyncWrites which
have been resolved (i.e. we have decided to commit / abort) but *not*
yet completed, then the commit/abort never happens
(DurabilityCompletionTask ignores non-active VBs).

As a consequence, the vBucket is in an inconsistent state - it will
still have the prepared SyncWrite in the HashTable, but no matching
prepare in the DM trackedWrites.

If this vBucket then becomes a replica, an error is seen when
receiving DCP mutations from the new active - when that sends the
DCP_COMMIT/ DCP_ABORT for the given prepare, a prepare _is_ found in
the HashTable, but the call to
PassiveDurabilityMonitor::completeSyncWrite() will fail as there is no
item in the trackedWrites:

    ERROR 149: exception occurred in runloop during packet execution.
    ...
    PassiveDurabilityMonitor::completeSyncWrite vb:368 No tracked, but received commit for key <ud>cid:0x0:00000000000000001037</ud>

This results in a failed rebalance (as the DCP connection is closed).

This problem was introduced by the asynchronous completion of
SyncWrites (in f6ed489642) - prior to that patch the resolved items we
immediately committed so it wasn't possible for there to be any
outstanding when the vBucket state changed.

+Solution+

Address this by ensuring that any resolved (but not completed)
SyncWrites are completed before we change away from active in
VBucket::setState_UNLOCKED().

Note that VBucket::setState_UNLOCKED() must have acquired an exclusive
lock on the vbStateLock, and hence there cannot be an instance of
DurabilityCompletionTask already procesing the vBuckets' resolved
SyncWrites.

Line:34, /COMMIT_MSG -> were

Line:46, /COMMIT_MSG -> processing

Line:557, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Is it worth noting somewhere that this might result in a rollback if we are becoming a replica? This would be a new case where the logs will show a rollback during a "routine" rebalance without a failover before.

(If it even does cause a rollback, I may have misremembered what would go on from yesterday)

Actually, (conjecture time!) if it /doesn't/ cause a rollback, could we ever get in a state where:
 node A commits a prepare, becomes a replica
 B becomes active and decides to abort the same prepare
 vbuuid had not changed because there was no failover
 A opens stream, does not rollback
 A has a commit at the same seqno B has an abort
 inconsistency?

Only 1/2 coffees so far so there may be a glaring hole in the conjecture, but thought it was worth mentioning as a point of thought :)

Line:557, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> It won't result in a rollback, as we are completing the SyncWrites /before/ we actually change the state to dead (and hence we should stream the remaining mutations to the destination replica.

Line:557, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Ahhh good - I was thinking we were "to late" in the takeover e.g., might be tearing streams down etc. :phew:
