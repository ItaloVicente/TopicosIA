Line:133, engines/ep/src/dcp/dcp-types.h -> Nit: I'd probably expand this to "DeleteSource" - the 3 characters you save don't make a significant difference, and potentially avoids ambiguity - "src" is often an abbreviation for "source code".

Line:321, engines/ep/src/item.h -> Nit: If you want to use doxygen-style comments (@param - which are a Good Thing) - then you should use a double ** in the comment block to mark as doxygen:

 /**
  *
  */

Line:503, engines/ep/src/item.h -> I don't think we need to store this explicitly - isn't it TTL is deleted==true and metadata.exptime != 0 ?
