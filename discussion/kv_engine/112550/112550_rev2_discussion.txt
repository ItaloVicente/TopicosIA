DESCRIPTION:

MB-35275: Skip ADM::highPreparedSeqno update on null->topology change

When a replica is promoted to active, the trackedWrites are
moved from the PDM to the ADM. This ADM will have a null topology and
the active node iterator will not exist. When we move from a null
topology to a topology we would then update the HPS and this causes
the highPreparedSeqno to throw a monotonic exception as the HPS loops
from trackedWrites->end() back to trackedWrites->end() and commits
all prepares if possible. In this case, skip the update of
highPreparedSeqno as to avoid throwing monotonic exceptions and to
ensure that the highPreparedSeqno is correct post topology update as
a replica that has just finished receiving a disk snapshot may have a
highPreparedSeqno that does not correspond to any prepare.

Line:1464, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Your current approach seems over-complex. 

It seems like you're trying to address the symptom - that when ADM is created with a null topology the active node iterator is in the wrong location (it's already persisted and hence completed) a number of SyncWrites.

I think we should instead address the underlying problem - have the active node iterator positioned at the last persisted SyncWrite.
