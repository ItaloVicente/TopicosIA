DESCRIPTION:

MB-35275: Skip ADM::HPS update on null->topology change

When a replica is promoted to active, the trackedWrites are
moved from the PDM to the ADM. This ADM will have a null topology and
the active node iterator will not exist. When we move from a null
topology to a topology we would then update the HPS and this causes
the highPreparedSeqno to throw a monotonic exception as the HPS loops
from trackedWrites->end() back to trackedWrites->end() and commits
all prepares if possible.

Avoid calling updateHighPreparedSeqno post topology change and
instead iterate over trackedWrites and commit everything after
setting the HPS iterator correctly.
