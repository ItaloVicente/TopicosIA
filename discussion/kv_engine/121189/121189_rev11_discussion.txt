DESCRIPTION:

MB-37009: Explicitly handle DCP error codes from a Consumer

Prior to this patch a DCP consumer can return the status codes to a
DCP producer for a subset of ops. However, we don't handle of these
status codes in an explicit manor and thus sometimes they're handled
incorrectly. Which in some cases caused rebalance bugs as we would ignore
error status codes from the DCP consumer. See MB-36971 and MB-36794.

This patch explicitly handles these non-success codes for a given op. To
ensure we handle the status code correctly. If it's not explicitly
handled for a given op then we will log an error code or throw for an
unknown opcode. Making it clear in the logs that the DCP consumer and
producer ended up in an unexpected state.

Also add unit tests to defend this in the future.
