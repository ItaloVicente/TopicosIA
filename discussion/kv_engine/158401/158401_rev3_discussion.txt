    Remove code that renumbers all queued set-vbstate items

    Code in setOpenCheckpointID is renumbering all set-vbstate items to
    equal the low-seqno of the checkpoint, this break the monotonicity of
    the checkpoint items. With expel running after this event, it's
    possible that the checkpoint is then left in a state which returns
    incorrect cursors.

    Note: 7.0 (cheshire-cat) already removes this code.
