DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Move HashTable::commit to EPVBucket

This includes a slight change to the commit logic to use the
externally visible HashTable interface instead of the internal
one. This requires that we allow callers to specify if they want to
avoid deleting Pending StoredValues from the HashTable.
