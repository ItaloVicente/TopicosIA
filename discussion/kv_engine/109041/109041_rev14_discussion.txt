DESCRIPTION:

Add HashTable delete by StoredValue ptr

Add a function to the HashTable to perform a delete of the given
StoredValue in the given HashBucket. This is useful when we know
which StoredValue we wish to delete but there could be multiple
per key i.e. a committed and pending SyncWrite. It's more flexible to
simply compare a pointer than pass through some given state.
