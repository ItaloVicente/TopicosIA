DESCRIPTION:

Add HashTable delete by StoredValue ptr

Add a function to the HashTable to perform a delete of the given
StoredValue in the given HashBucket. This is useful when we know
which StoredValue we wish to delete but there could be multiple
per key i.e. a committed and pending SyncWrite. It's more flexible to
simply compare a pointer than pass through some given state.

Line:733, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Note that lambdas capture by-value by default - this will create a copy of the DocKey. prefer [&key].

The alternative way to achieve this (which would avoid having to have a template instantiation for every call to unlocked_relase_base). would be to have the find return a pointer to unique_ptr owning the found item - i.e. a pointer to the chain which _points_ to the given element.

That means that unlocked_release() itself doesn't need to scan the chains again - it just unlinks the chain at that point (and you no longer need to use HashChainRemoveFirst.

(Basically what I'm alluding to is an STL-like model where you provide a single find_if() method which searches for an element matching a predicate, the result of that can be fed into unlocked_del / unlocked_release() and doesn't need to walk the chain a second time.

Line:985, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> As per previous review comments, not necessary repeat the documentation for each overload.

Line:1125, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Ditto

Line:1301, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Nit: Prefer the suffix "Inner" for helper functions which implement the inner part of (mutlple) other methods. "Base" implies this is some kind of class hierarchy and this is the base method.

Line:733, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Changed to capture by reference.

Would be nice to do that, but we would need the previous element (if one exists) to re-link the chain. Should be possible to get that without an increase in time complexity and hide it in StoredValueProxy but will make find a lot more complicated

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:733, engines/ep/src/hash_table.cc -> Sure, that's what I mean - you return a pointer to the pointer - which will be a pointer to either the HashTable base chain (if the first element) or the parent item.

(Kinda classic linked-list management - you often return a double-pointer so you can unlink (and remove) the item without having to somehow traverse the list again.
