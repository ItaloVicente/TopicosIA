DESCRIPTION:

MB-27669: Decompress the value in 'off' mode after a Bg Fetch

and if the bucket compression mode is 'off', the value needs to
be decompressed and stored in the hash table.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review-1

I don't think we should be performing compression on the Read (bgfetch path), for a couple of reasons:

1. It'll increase the latency of front-end GETs which hit disk - both for this specific request (we need to spend CPU cycles compressing it); and for any other bgFetches in the batch (their callback will be delayed by the work of compressing this document).

2. Most (all?) documents should already be compressed on disk; and so there shouldn't be any work to do here anyways

3. Related to the above, it complicates the code - my expectation is the *only* time KV-Engine ever compresses documents is:

# when writing documents to disk - as it's (a) worthwhile compressing something to save on disk bandwidth, or
# By the active compression pager - which is done in the background so doesn't affect front-end latency.

To summarise, I don't believe we need this patch at all.
