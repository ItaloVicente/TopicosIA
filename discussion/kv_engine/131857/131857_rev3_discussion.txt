DESCRIPTION:

MB-40277: Account for stream-id in flow-control counter

Mutation (deletion), snapshot marker, system event and seqno advanced
can all be sent on a stream-id enabled DCP stream, they were missing
the addition of the 3-byte framing-info used by stream-id. A client
would be seen to over-ack by 3 bytes per message triggering an
under-flow exception.

Additional to this seqno-advanced was missing the sid encoding as
parameter wasn't passed down from engine to memcached (again leading
to accounting mis-matches).
