DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Implement logical delete for magma

Add new kvstoreRev parameter to track kvstore revision. Its maintained
on magmaInfo which is updated as part of vbstate.
Implement prepareToCreateImpl to incrment the kvstoreRev.
Implement prepareToDeleteImpl to soft delete the kvstore in magma.
If the vbucket exists, it must call prepareToDelete prior to calling
prepareToCreate or exception will the thrown.

Magma SoftDeleteKVStore effectively deletes the kvstore by moving the
shared pointer to the kvstore to a pending delete list. Subsequent
attempts to access that kvstore in magma will return NotExists status.
The kvstore storage should eventually be deleted when delVBucket is
called. Its at this point we wait for all users of the kvstore to
complete any outstanding operations before removing the storage to the
kvstore.

In the event of an unexpected outage where their are dropped kvstores
still pending, recovery will delete old kvstores up to the latest
kvstore.
