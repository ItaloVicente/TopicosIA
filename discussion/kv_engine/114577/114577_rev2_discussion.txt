DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Turn on some module tests to test magma

This is a phased checkin as we change tests to become parameterized and
add in magma.

This includes several tests which has to deal with bloom filters being
disabled because magma does not need kv_engine's bloom filters since it
already has bloom filters on the sstables.

1 test erase_after_warmup is disabled for magma awaiting a magma
recovery fix.
