DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Turn on some module tests to test magma

This is a phased checkin as we change tests to become parameterized and
add in magma.

Several tests required changes to deal with persistent+full eviction
case because magma removes the bloom filters so an extra call to the
BGFetcher is required.
