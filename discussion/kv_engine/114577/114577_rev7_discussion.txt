DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Turn on some module tests to test magma

This is a phased checkin as we change tests to become parameterized and
add in magma.

This includes several tests which has to deal with bloom filters being
disabled because magma does not need kv_engine's bloom filters since it
already has bloom filters on the sstables.

1 test erase_after_warmup is disabled for magma awaiting a magma
recovery fix.

(13 comments)
Line:20, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/collections_test.h -> This shouldn't be necessary - you haven't changed anything else in this header which implies that the header itself doesn't need to know any definitions from `item.h`. What's the reason for this change?

Line:275, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> I don't think you really need the bloomFilterEnabled clause in the check here - even if it's on it might not correctly predict if the item is or isn't on disk (it may give a false positive).

Line:606, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> We should probably keep 'SingleThreaded' in the test fixture name.

Line:3764, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> I suggest you just increase the seqno (then it should work for magma)- this is likely just a latent bug where the item's seqno wasn't increased (given it didn't matter before for couchstore / RocksDB).

Line:25, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.h -> Similar to previous comment - why is this needed?

(We try to minimise includes - especially in header files - to keep compile times down).

Line:309, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.h -> Whitespace looks broken.

Line:341, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.h -> Similar to previous, I don't think you be necessarily checking if the bloom filter is on - it depends on the operation. If the bloom filter is enabled:

- For add() / replace() filter could return a false positive (could be a collision with another key) and hence still need to go to disk (EWOULBLOCK) to confirm if key already exists or not.

Line:356, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.h -> checkKeyExists is probably a more explicit / descriptive name.

Line:367, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.h -> This is somewhat brief / vague - it doesn't document the fact it handles the EWOULDBLOCK case where necessary.

Line:382, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.h -> Ditto

Line:404, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.h -> Again, is bloom filters on/off guaranteed to give the correct answer (considering false positives)?

Line:422, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.h -> These overloads are repeated in a bunch of places. Please can you define them in a single place (so if/when we need to update then we aren't changing loads of places in the code)?

Line:872, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> Simpler to just define the local `persistent` as a bool.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:25, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.h -> Ok. Can you de-inline checkKeyExists, moving it to the .cc then, so we don't need the header here?
