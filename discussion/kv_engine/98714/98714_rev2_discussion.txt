DESCRIPTION:

MB-30916: Don't free closed-checkpoint-memory under lock (2)

In http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/98468/ I wanted to fix the
performance regression introduced in
http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/98301/ (checkpoint memory released under
CM::queueLock), but after that fix memory is still freed under lock.

At last, here I free checkpoint memory after the lock has been released.

Fix looks good. 

It would be good to have a (micro) benchmark which captures this issue, given the effort taken to track down in a full perfrunner tests.

Suggest you take a look at vbucket_bench.cc - that already has separate queueDirty and Flushing benchmarks, where it measures the cost to queue / flush batches of items. 

You could create a additional benchmark which say runs the flusher continuously in a background thread, and then in the frontend thread performs constant queueDirty and have Google Benchmark measure the performance of that.

Patch Set 2:

Working on the new benchmark for this, I've not managed yet to get relevant differences in before/after runs.
I'm doing:
1) front-end thread (bench thread measuring calls to CheckpointManager::queueDirty())
2) bg-flusher thread
3) bg-checkpoint-remover thread

Are you happy to merge this fix now without the new benchmark (coming soon in a follow-up patch) ?

Perftests on toy-build provide a good evidence of goodness of this fix:

That seems reasonable.

I'd prefer to get the benchmark in first - as we can then confirm it's tracked correctly by CBNT.
