DESCRIPTION:

MB-30916: Don't free closed-checkpoint-memory under lock (2)

In http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/98468/ I wanted to fix the
performance regression introduced in
http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/98301/ (checkpoint memory released under
CM::queueLock), but after that fix memory is still freed under lock.

At last, here I free checkpoint memory after the lock has been released.

This regression has been known for a while, and recenlty also spotted by
the Perf team in MB-31834.
