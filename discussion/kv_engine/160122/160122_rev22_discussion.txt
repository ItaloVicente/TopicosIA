DESCRIPTION:

MB-47687: Add highSeqno to magma UserStats

This patch records highSeqno of the snapshot in
UserStats.

Atm if a tombstone drop or prepare is purged via
the compaction callback and subsequently rolled
back, the doc may not show up in the rollback
callback. The rollback callback iterates the latest
snapshot from rollbackSeqno to current highSeqno
so the dropped item will not show up in the callback.
The highSeqno stored in UserStats will be retrieved
from Magma's oldest checkpoint and used to prevent
drop of tombstones, completed prepares and
collections.
