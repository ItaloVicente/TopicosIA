DESCRIPTION:

Bump compaction timeout in PiTR test

The test is often failing locally as it takes more than 2 seconds to
run a compaction. Adding extra logs showed that slow flushes were
the cause. Whilst the test probably shouldn't take that long to flush,
it shouldn't cause us to fail due to a compaction command taking too
long. Bump the timeout to the duration that we run the compaction
thread for, if we don't compact enough during the test then we'll
fail a check at the end on the number of compactions run instead.
