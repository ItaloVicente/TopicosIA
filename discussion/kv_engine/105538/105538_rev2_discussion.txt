DESCRIPTION:

MB-33159: Improve error checking on get_collection_id

Update get_collection_id so that it can error if the given
path is an unknown scope.

Part of this change spotted that get_scope_id is not consistently
specfified along with get_collection_id, mainly that empty should
be valid and means _default.

Change-Id: I9f8a565284d55c54e56cfa7a1504bff15f428ce5
