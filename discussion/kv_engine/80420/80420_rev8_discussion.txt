DESCRIPTION:

CBPS-381: Split the assoc table into multiple partitions

The old hashtable had 1 lock protecting the entire table
causing a relative high lock contention and low throughput.

This patch splits the assoc table into partitions which
allows for locking a smaller segment (1/1024) of the entire
cache. The initial hash table is set to be bigger than
earlier (256k compared to 65k), but the total memory size
for the initial hashtable is just 2MB which is why I didn't
made it smaller. Note that this hashtable is shared between
all of the memcached buckets on the node, and only allocated
the first time someone tries to create a memcached bucket.

To avoid a burst of threads being created whenever we want
to grow the hashtables (and they'll most likely need to grow
at the same time) a dedicated maintenance thread is being
created when the first memcached bucket is being created
which lives for the duration of the memcached process
lifetime. It waits in a condition variable until there
is (at least) one partition which needs to migrate
data over from one partition to another. Once the
condition variable gets notified it wakes up and tries
to rebalance all of the partitions.

Patch Set 8: Code-Review-1

I've not looked at the code in detail yet, but I think we should hold off merging any such large change to memcache buckets at this stage with Spock, particulary given that we don't have a large amount of system testing done on memcache buckets.

Propose we defer this until we have branched.
