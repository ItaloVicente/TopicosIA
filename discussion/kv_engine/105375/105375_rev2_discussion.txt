DESCRIPTION:

MB-31811: Fix data race on collections persistedHighSeqno

In a test introduced in a future commit, we make many stats calls
to read the highSeqno of a collection. We don't actually care about
the persistedHighSeqno in these tests, but it is read by the stats calls
whilst things get flushed (this value gets written) in the bakground.
TSan identifies this as a data race which would cause a sporadic test
failure. Fix this by making the persistedHighSeqno atomic.

Line:266, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> Is this not problematic - we might end up claiming something is persisted and then it goes backwards? 

What's the purpose of persistedHighSeqno?

Additionally I note that at setPersistedHighSeqno() isn't safe if it's called without a lock - it need to perform a compare_exchange() if you don't want to potentially loose updates.

Line:266, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> We need to store the high seqno on disk so that we can warmup without scanning. I added this so that we don't have to read the stats local doc and work this out at the point at which we flush.

You're right about setPersistedHighSeqno, we don't have multiple flushing threads looking at the same VB at the same time though do we?

If we lost an update then restarted, the collection high seqno we return from GET_ALL_VB_SEQNOS would be behind until we write to that collection again. Any consumer has to handle this case already for vbucket seqnos. The stats would also be wrong though.

A given vBucket is only ever flushed by a single task, so yes we shouldn't have multiple actors attempting to write; but it's generally good practice to compartmentalise objects so they are always internally consistent regardless of how they are used.

So I think it should be perfectly safe (and a good paranoid check) to use Monotonic for persitedHighSeqno; you just manually need to the monotonic check when updating it (i.e. it should expose a monotonic value; even if the updates happen potentially out of order). 

The other thing you could do would be to only call setPersistedHighSeqno once per flush (at the end); given that until couchstore commits the batch they arn't actually committed anyway. That /would/ mean the value was strictly monotonic (and remove the need for the explicit check in setPersistedHighSeqno), as flusher batches are indeed guaranteed to always be of increasing seqno.

Line:266, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> Okay, will update to use AtomicMonotonic and IgnorePolicy so we don't need the manual check. Don't know why I didn't do that in the first place.

Updating once would be nice, but I'm not sure it's worth the extra complexity of storing another high seqno per collection in collections/flush to track this.

Line:266, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest_entry.h -> That's probably fine for now - but I'd suggest updating the comment here explaining the rationale / limitations of the current implementation.
