DESCRIPTION:

MB-54729: DCP disk backfill a CDC stream

Backfill of a CDC stream has 4 possible outcomes.

1) No History.

If no history is retained by the KVStore, the backfill behaves no
differently than it would on 7.1. ByID or BySeqno backfilling will
produce a single snapshot (normal or OSO) for start to end of the
disk range.

2) History Available.

If the KVStore indicates that history is available the following 3
outcomes are possible.

2.1) start >= ScanContext::historyStartSeqno => single snapshot marker

Note this case cannot be encountered with OSO. OSO requires a start
of 0.

This case occurs because the start seqno is within the retained history.
A single snapshot is produced that includes all seqnos from start to the
end of the seqno index. This will be "scanAllVersions" scan and the
snapshot gets tagged with the "History" flag and tagged that it "may
contain duplicates".

2.2) start < ScanContext::historyStartSeqno => two snapshots

Note that this case has two outcomes. If an OSO snapshot is possible.
An OSO snapshot is followed by a regular snapshot (tagged as History).
If OSO is not possible, two regular snapshots occur (differentiated by
flags).

When the backfill starts below the retained history, DCP will backfill
all of the available sequence data, non-history followed by history.
This requires two DCP snapshots produced from the same disk snapshot.

The first DCP snapshot is the non-history range, a KVStore::scan from
the requested start up to, but not including
ScanContext::historyStartSeqno. Or this will be an OSO snapshot of the
requested collection - the entire collection ByID range.

The second DCP snapshot is the history range, a
KVStore::scanAllVersions from ScanContext::historyStartSeqno to the end
of the disk snapshots sequence index. This snapshot is tagged to
indicate that it's History and that it "may contain duplicates".

Note that in the case when two DCP snapshots are generated (no OSO),
both markers represent full disk range, including the MVS/HCS. The
intention of this is to ensure that a failure before reaching the end
of the disk snapshot, the client knows it's somewhere in the middle of
the full disk range and can correctly resume DCP with the correct start
and snapshot range.

For example:

The disk snapshot has a range of sequence numbers from 1 to 20. This is
split into two sub-ranges. Non-history (nh) and history (h).

    nh{1,10} h{11, 20}

If a full backfill occurs of this disk snapshot (DCP stream start is 0)
two markers will prefix the transmission of the ranges.

snapshot marker 1:
    snapshot-range{0, 20}
    mvs = 20, hcs = 20
    flags = disk | checkpoint

mutations 0 to 10

snapshot marker 2:
    snapshot range{0, 20}
    mvs = 20, hcs = 20
    flags = disk | checkpoint | history | may_contain_duplicates

mutations 11 to 20

If the client disconnected after mutation 10, they would resume with
start=10, range={0,20}, indicating they have a partial snapshot.

Implementation Notes:

The implementation of the "history" range adds a new optional phase to
the DCP backfill state machine. When the backfill transitions into
backfill_state_scanning the variations of the backfill are checked for.

From here the following paths exist.

1) No History.

    backfill_state_scanning -> backfill_state_complete

In this case the full snapshot is delivered from backfill_state_scanning
phase.

2.1) Only history.
    backfill_state_scanning -> backfill_state_scanning_history_snapshot

In this case the full snapshot is delivered from
backfill_state_scanning_history_snapshot phase. The

The backfill_state_scanning phase has only inspected the ScanContext
and skipped to history.

2.2) Two snapshots (OSO and regular).
    backfill_state_scanning -> backfill_state_scanning_history_snapshot

In this case both backfill phases are delivering "snapshots" from the
same magma disk snapshot.
