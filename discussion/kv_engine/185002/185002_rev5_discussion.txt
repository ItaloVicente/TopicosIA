DESCRIPTION:

MB-54729: DCP disk backfill a CDC stream

Backfill of a CDC stream has 3 possible outcomes.

If no history is retained, the backfill behaves no differently than it
would on 7.1. This case can occur because "history_retention_bytes=0"
or the vbucket has explicitly "dropped" any retained history (corner
case of history replication).

If history is retained the backfill can behave in two ways depending on
where the backfill start seqno is relative to
ScanContext::historyStartSeqno.

Case1: start >= ScanContext::historyStartSeqno

The backfill starts inside the retained history range, the backfill
will generate a single DCP snapshot marker followed by the mutations.
The DCP snapshot will state "history" and "may contain duplicates".

Case2: start < ScanContext::historyStartSeqno

The backfill starts below the retained history range. In this case the
disk snapshot is used to generate two DCP snapshots.

The first DCP snapshot is the non-history range, a KVStore::scan from
the requested start upto, but not including
ScanContext::historyStartSeqno.

The second DCP snapshot is the history range, a
KVStore::scanAllVersions from ScanContext::historyStartSeqno to the end
of the disk snapshots sequence index.

In case 2, both DCP snapshot markers state they are for the same
range - to ensure that at the end of the first snapshot the client
knows they don't have a complete snapshot.

E.g.

disk-snapshot has two ranges, non-history (nh) and history (h)

    nh{1,10} h{11, 20}

E.g. if a backfill from 0 occurs DCP will transmit as follows:

marker1 range{0, 20} flags=disk
mutations 1..10
marker2 range{0, 20} flags=disk|history|may contain duplicates
mutations 11..20

The implementation of the "history" range is done by adding a new
optional phase to the DCP backfill state machine. When the backfill
transitions into backfill_state_scanning the variations of the
backfill are checked for. From here the following paths exist.

No history;
backfill_state_scanning -> backfill_state_complete

Only history:
backfill_state_scanning -> backfill_state_scanning_history_snapshot

Two snapshots
backfill_state_scanning -> backfill_state_scanning_history_snapshot

Note that in "Only history" vs "Two snapshots", the initial scan phase
terminates early to skip out the non-history scan.
