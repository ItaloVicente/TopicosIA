DESCRIPTION:

MB-29675: Move ObjectRegistry stats to CoreLocalStats

ObjectRegistry updates stats on the number and size of various object
classes whenever those classes are constructed/destructed. Currently
it updates a single set of stats per Bucket. However, these statistics
are highly contended by all the frontend worker threads; as such the
various functions to update the stats show high in profiling.

For example during 20/80 R/W pillowfight run, a representative worker
thread shows the following:

    Samples: 205K of event 'cycles:ppp', Event count (approx.): 110332199760, Thread: mc:worker_16
    Overhead  Command       Shared Object                 Symbol
       1.52%  mc:worker_16  ep.so                         [.] ObjectRegistry::onCreateBlob
       1.43%  mc:worker_16  ep.so                         [.] ObjectRegistry::onCreateItem
       1.04%  mc:worker_16  ep.so                         [.] ObjectRegistry::onDeleteItem
       0.59%  mc:worker_16  ep.so                         [.] ObjectRegistry::onDeleteBlob

Approx ~4.5% of the thread's runtime is spent in stats
updating. Examining the asm-level, a significant number of the cycles
is spent on the atomic updates to those counters; which appears to be
due to cacheline contention.

Given these stats are frequerntly updated but rarely read, we can
reduce this cost by moving these hotly-contended counters into the new
CoreLocalStats class, so each core has it's own instance to write to.

In microbenchmarks this reduces the cost to create/delete a
StoredValue by ~20%:
