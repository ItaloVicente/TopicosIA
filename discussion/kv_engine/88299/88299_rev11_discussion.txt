DESCRIPTION:

MB-27457: [3/n] Give dcp_expiry its own packet definition

dcp_delete will be updated so that current format loses collections
and a new v2 format added will gain collections/delete-time.

Even though ep-engine doesn't generate expiry DCP messages, there will
be no need to add delete-time to expiry (delete-time only applies to
delete items being streamed back from disk).

It's simpler to make the current delete definition become expiry so
that all of the code (mostly tests) which handles the expiry format
don't need changes too.
