DESCRIPTION:

MB-51606: Notify PDM of last consistent point on transition

To ensure that we can ack any seqno that a previous active node may
have processed but was not yet satisfied (i.e. persisted). This fixes
the following scenario:

1) vBucket was active
2) vBucket starts sync write requiring persistence (seqno 1)
3) vBucket set to dead
4) vBucket persists sync write from step 3
5) vBucket set to replica
6) vBucket connects to new active and sends no seqno ack
