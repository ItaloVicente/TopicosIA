DESCRIPTION:

MB-36133: Persist highPreparedSeqno for the last completed snap

If a replica crashes and warms up in the middle of a snapshot (i.e.,
the snapshot has only been partially persisted) it needs to warm up a
suitable HighPreparedSeqno. It cannot simply use the seqno of the most
recent prepare, as this prepare may be from a partial snapshot. The
in-memory snapshot is only allowed to move into complete snapshots to
avoid seqno acking prepares before the replica has reached a consistent
point (a snapshot end).

This patch adds a new field to vbstate `completed_snap_prepared_seqno`
which is the highest prepare seqno, from the most recent _fully
persisted_ snapshot.

Line:1673, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> This shouldn't go backwards... Consider a disk snap with all prepares de-duped. We'd then end up with a HPS of 0 in memory post-warmup.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Suggest you drop this clause - the "High Prepared Seqno" _is_ by definition the last prepare which can be validly claimed to be complete - which for disk is at snapshot boundary.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Call this high_prepared_seqno in vbstate (given it's the same as the in-memory one).

Line:573, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> please auto document these.

Line:724, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> indeed.

Line:65, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Is this true? Isn't it actually the same as the snapshot end (assuming there's SyncWrites in this checkpoint)?

Line:408, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Please rename this - I think it is now "persisted_prepared_seqno" - @Ben ?

Line:761, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> PPS

Line:163, engines/ep/src/vbucket_state.h -> As previous, this isn't accurate - it's a snapshot boundary.

Line:171, engines/ep/src/vbucket_state.h -> highPreparedSeqno

Line:573, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Done

Line:724, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Verily.

Line:65, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> I think it is true? Not sure I quite understand the angle on this. In the checkpoint it is pulled from it is updated by every prepare, and would only equal the snap end if the last thing were a prepare?

Line:163, engines/ep/src/vbucket_state.h -> Hmm I've definitely not quite got this yet. The intent was to allow us to persist a value which reflects the in memory movement of the HPS, as I understood it:

when persisting a snapshot:
Disk snapshot - HPS moves to snap end (dealing with dedupe)
Memory snapshot - advances to the latest prepare in the snapshot

The MB covered the HPS being too far ahead after warmup; I can change to using the end of the latest completed snapshot rather than piping this through, but then we have the opposite issue of the HPS after warmup might be behind where it should be, and if there are no more sync writes it might not get advanced again ever.

I feel I've missed something key if it should be a snapshot boundary, but I'm not sure where yet

Line:171, engines/ep/src/vbucket_state.h -> Done

Line:1673, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> Going to seperate that out into a second patch, changing it to make it not go backwards breaks a handful more tests

Line:163, engines/ep/src/vbucket_state.h -> Whenever we persist _anything_, it ends up in a single snapshot on disk - for example if I persist [8, 9, 10] where 9 was a Prepare, then while we did just write 3 items, there's only really a snapshot from 1..10 available on disk to later read.

As such, I think when writing to disk the HPS *should* be persisted as "10" - given if we later crashed & warmed up (or had to stream to another replica),  we should restore high_prepated_seqno to 10 (only once warmup has been completed). 

@Ben do you agree? Or am I getting mixed up...
