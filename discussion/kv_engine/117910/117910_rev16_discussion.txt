DESCRIPTION:

MB-36133: Persist highPreparedSeqno

If a replica crashes and warms up in the middle of a snapshot (i.e.,
the snapshot has only been partially persisted) it needs to warm up a
suitable HighPreparedSeqno. It cannot simply use the seqno of the most
recent prepare, as this prepare may be from a partial snapshot. The
in-memory snapshot is only allowed to move into complete snapshots to
avoid seqno acking prepares before the replica has reached a consistent
point (a snapshot end).

This patch adds a new field to vbstate `high_prepared_seqno`
which is the highest prepare seqno, from the most recent _fully
persisted_ snapshot.

Line:1886, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> did you mean

ASSERT_GT(pps, hps)?

Line:1886, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> Oh you're right, in this case ASSERT_GT(pps, hps);

Could we add the test for ASSERT_GT(hps, pps) please ?
Ie, the start point must be:
- testFullyPersistedSnapshotSetHPS(CheckpointType::Disk);

And, maybe you could expand this test to covering the same 4 scenario that you have covered above for Replica:
- Partially Persisted / Checkpoint::Memory
- Partially Persisted / Checkpoint::Disk
- Fully Persisted / Checkpoint::Memory
- Fully Persisted / Checkpoint::Disk
