DESCRIPTION:

MB-36133: Persist highPreparedSeqno

If a replica crashes and warms up in the middle of a snapshot (i.e.,
the snapshot has only been partially persisted) it needs to warm up a
suitable HighPreparedSeqno. It cannot simply use the seqno of the most
recent prepare, as this prepare may be from a partial snapshot. The
in-memory snapshot is only allowed to move into complete snapshots to
avoid seqno acking prepares before the replica has reached a consistent
point (a snapshot end).

This patch adds a new field to vbstate `high_prepared_seqno`
which is the highest prepare seqno, from the most recent _fully
persisted_ snapshot.

Line:353, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> Again, as per our whiteboard discussions this is incorrect / misleading. It's true for MOOO (Disk) Checkpoints, but for IO (Memory) checkpoints the value is stored in vbstate sooner.

You probably don't need to document this in detail twice, one accurate description next to say the high_prepared_seqno member is sufficient.

Line:573, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> If the high_prepared_seqno in the Checkpoint should be Monotonic then I suggest just using that class.

Line:734, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> This is kinda true, but possibly misleading - level=majority SyncWrites can be prepared before the entire checkpoint has been persisted.

Suggest you clarify the comment.

Line:66, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Same comment as earlier.

Line:407, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> I'd probably just drop this - as long as you document the high_prepared_seqno usage in the flusher correctly then that will explain what it is used for.

At most I might say something like "compare with HPS which is another seqno referring to prepares but has different semantics..."

Line:761, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> HPS is fine - just using another term will confuse matters.

Line:117, engines/ep/src/vbucket_state.cc -> Can you raise a separate patch to fix this bug you spotted the other day?

Line:163, engines/ep/src/vbucket_state.h -> Not 100% correct; as long as the prepare was from a Memory (IO) Checkpoint the snapshot doesn't have to be completed I believe.

Line:573, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Sorry missed this - what is the favoured convention for optional monotonics?

Line:573, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> You _could_ have a boost::optional<Monotonic<uint64_t>>, but personally I think it's a bit overkill given that seqno 0 is never valid so you could just use that to indicate no seqno is set - i.e. just do

 Monotonic<uint64_t> highPrepatedSeqno;

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:117, engines/ep/src/vbucket_state.cc -> Suggest a separate patch under this MB.
