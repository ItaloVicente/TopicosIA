DESCRIPTION:

MB-36133: Persist highPreparedSeqno for the last completed snap

If a replica crashes and warms up in the middle of a snapshot (i.e.,
the snapshot has only been partially persisted) it needs to warm up a
suitable HighPreparedSeqno. It cannot simply use the seqno of the most
recent prepare, as this prepare may be from a partial snapshot. The
in-memory snapshot is only allowed to move into complete snapshots to
avoid seqno acking prepares before the replica has reached a consistent
point (a snapshot end).

This patch adds a new field to vbstate `completed_snap_prepared_seqno`
which is the highest prepare seqno, from the most recent _fully
persisted_ snapshot.

Your comment makes sense, but I think that it's only valid for going down in the middle of a memory snapshot. If we went down in the middle of a disk snapshot then we could potentially lose a write due to de-dupe.

But if we go down in the middle of a disk snapshot, then we shouldn't have ACK'd it yet so there's nothing _to_ loose...

We will ack it when we reconnect and it could make us eligible for promotion
