DESCRIPTION:

MB-36133: Persist highPreparedSeqno

If a replica crashes and warms up in the middle of a snapshot (i.e.,
the snapshot has only been partially persisted) it needs to warm up a
suitable HighPreparedSeqno. It cannot simply use the seqno of the most
recent prepare, as this prepare may be from a partial snapshot. The
in-memory snapshot is only allowed to move into complete snapshots to
avoid seqno acking prepares before the replica has reached a consistent
point (a snapshot end).

This patch adds a new field to vbstate `high_prepared_seqno`
which is the highest prepare seqno, from the most recent _fully
persisted_ snapshot.

Line:192, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Great that you spotted that guys, as we were very close to introduce a bug.
In particular, if we set (s->hps=vbs.hps) after takeover then it could happen that a Prepare hangs in-flight for long time (given that Active must always be part of majority for a Prepare to be satisfied).

Just re-checked the test and seems that we don't verify the various seqnos (HPS, HCS, PPS) in any Active test. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Line:192, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Actually, I'm not certain it would break in flight prepares - wouldn't checkForCommit() still successfully move them to the resolved queue, and overwrite the "bad" hps value?

In any case, I agree; adding further tests.
