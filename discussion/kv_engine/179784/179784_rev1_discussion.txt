DESCRIPTION:

Add script rebasing chrome traces to a shared timeline

When using kv_slow_ops_2_gtrace on output from multiple nodes,
rebase the timestamps of traces from different nodes to a joint,
normalised timeline using the timestamps in logs.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hi Stan,

Thanks for uploading this improvement. The general workflow with Gerrit is to:

1. Upload your patch
2. Iterate on it until you think it is ready for review and it has passed commit-validation - however we don't have any tests for kv_slow_ops_2_gtrace so you can ignore CV here.
3. Add the "kv_engine_dev" group to Reviewers - that notifies the team about your patch and then you will either get +2 approved, or suggestions on how to adjust (and then you're back to step 1).

I've added the team to this now so people can take a look at it.

Line:31, engines/ep/management/kv_slow_ops_2_gtrace -> What input is this regex here expected to match? None of the example usage (in rebase_gtrace) would appear to result in any lines like this in memcached.log...

Line:1, engines/ep/management/rebase_gtrace -> Prefer to use a hashbang line of:

 #!/usr/bin/env python3
 
That will use whichever 'python3' binary is in the user's path, and hence is more flexible in environments where python3 is located elsewhere, or the user wishes to use a different python3 binary than the default.

Line:3, engines/ep/management/rebase_gtrace -> 2022

Line:16, engines/ep/management/rebase_gtrace -> As per comment on previous file, this is example usage correct?

Line:36, engines/ep/management/rebase_gtrace -> This feels a bit like using exceptions for control-flow. I assume the KeyError is if node is not present in the `nodes` dict - if so just explicitly check for node in node in the predicate - something like:

 if (node not in node) or ts < nodes[nodes][0]:
    ...

Many thanks for your feedback, and massive apologies for getting back to it so late. I hope I've addressed all your comments appropriately.

Line:31, engines/ep/management/kv_slow_ops_2_gtrace -> This matches a cbcollect node folder in the path to memcached.log. I originally provided wrong instructions for use, hopefully the new ones make this regex more clear.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:31, engines/ep/management/kv_slow_ops_2_gtrace -> Makes sense. 

Good practice for this sort of thing is to include an example of the string(s) being matched in the comment for the code (i.e. as part of your comment at line 29); that way if things change / break in future it helps the reader to figure out what the regex now needs to be expanded to cover.

Line:16, engines/ep/management/rebase_gtrace -> No, what you have here is fine I think - it's fine for us to start with some usage and later expand / enhance, but helpful if people who didn't write it know how to use it - or indeed the author in 6 months time!

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:16, engines/ep/management/rebase_gtrace -> Totally my bad - it was incorrect, thank you for catching that.

I am basing the usage off support's workflow of downloading a log collection .zip containing multiple nodes, and operating on the extracted folders named a certain way. If more flexibility is desired wrt folder naming, please let me know and I can add that in.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:36, engines/ep/management/rebase_gtrace -> I think one of the key things about "forgiveness vs permission" is what the expected result is. 

If one "typically" expects the operation to succeed, then yes, "asking for forgiveness" in the exceptional path (indeed, say via exceptions) is a sensible approach - the reader of the code can assume that the requested operation should normally succeed, and on failure we have a way of handling it.

But if one doesn't necessarily expect the operation to succeed - or even worse, is more likely to fail than succeed - then that makes the code harder to follow.


It can also come at additional (runtime) cost - throwing and catching an exception is more costly than an if / else (see for example https://dlecocq.github.io/blog/2012/01/08/the-cost-of-except-in-python/). In this case I don't believe that is particulary important - this is unlikely to be performance-critical; but I think it's a good habit to get into.

Line:36, engines/ep/management/rebase_gtrace -> I was using the pythonic principle of "Ask forgiveness, not permission" (https://stackoverflow.com/a/12265860)
Nevertheless, I've made the change in line with your feedback.
