DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Move to event-driven checkpoint removal task

Separates routine removal of unreffed checkpoints from "emergency"
memory recovery methods like cursor dropping and expelling.

Now, once a checkpoint becomes unreferenced, the checkpoint removal
task can be notified. The task tracks vbs to visit in a VBReadyQueue,
so does not need to scan every vb each run.
