DESCRIPTION:

MB-53053: Add PausingVisitorAdapter for cross-bucket eviction

The planned approach for cross-bucket item eviction is to evict items
from VBuckets in a round-robin fashion.

This can be accomplished by having an instance of this adapter task
scheduled per bucket and by manually wake()-ing each bucket's task in
a round-robin fashion.

This adapter will allow us to evict items from a:1 (bucket:vb) callback
into some common synchronisation point, schedule b:1, callback again,
schedule a:2 and so on...

*Alternative approaches*

We could use a GlobalTask scheduled on some non-engine taskable
(NoBucketTaskable or some new cross-bucket paging taskable). If we were
to do that, we'd have to maintain the state of each bucket's
PagingVisitors (or create a new cross-bucket PagingVisitor) and would
have to ensure that we're not starving threads, handling engine
shutdown etc.

We could also just set the existing PagingVisitors running as we
currently do, for all buckets sharing quota, and stop when the
sum(mem_used) < sum(LWM). But that could mean unfair eviction in the
sense that large HTs with a similar number of evictable items at the
same MFU might be slower to evict from, thereby always penalising
small HTs.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't know how I feel about this. I haven't looked at any other changes you've made yet, but wouldn't the common synchronization point need some knowledge of the other PagingVisitors/Buckets (i.e. the downside to this approach if we were to instead use some non-engine taskable task)?

Line:2522, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Why do we need this? I guess it could save us from unnecessarily rescheduling if the remaining vBuckets have been deleted, but a) the comment says what rather than why and b) why do we care about an extra task run?

Line:2532, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Is it possible to update the wake time from another thread while the task is at this line, then for us to effectively miss that as we then update the wake time to INT_MAX on the next line?

I think that the answer is yes; even if the code doesn't actually do that right now, I don't think we should a big foot gun. Can we use our scheduled/notified/snooze pattern here instead, in which we snooze immediately for INT_MAX and use some atomic to guard notifications (See BgFetcher for an example). I think that NotifiableTask might be what we want here.

Line:102, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> perhaps the adapters can be pulled into a new file

Line:114, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> According to the helper comment on VBCBAdapter

> It is used to assist in visiting multiple vBuckets, without creating a separate task (and associated task overhead) for each vBucket individually.

This is for historical reasons; prior to FollyExecutorPool we used CB3ExecutorPool which didn't work well with large numbers of tasks. With FollyExecutorPool we have found that to be less of a problem, so newer tasks have often been created per vBucket if appropriate. I'd suggest doing some investigation here, we might be able to schedule a task per vBucket instead and rely on schedule order for the round-robin behaviour. One downside is if memory drops below LWM and we have a bunch of tasks we need to clean up, but I think it's worth investigating.

Line:123, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Not a fan of the name, things like CappedDurationVBucketVisitor already pause on durations, rather than after every vBucket, and the name of this adapter could perhaps be mistakenly attributed to that class. Perhaps something like "IndividualVBucketVisitorAdapter" conveys the behaviour better, but open to any other suggestions

Line:133, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> This feels like it should be another subclass that this class implements (the functionality is not strictly related to that of this class, and it may be useful elsewhere)

Line:1, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vb_adapters_test.cc -> line not necessary

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes, it would. The CrossBucketVisitorAdapter which I've added in a later patch is the common synchronisation point. It knows about all buckets that need to be visited.

We could run the PagingVisitors for all quota sharing buckets on a non-engine taskable task, as you suggest. Happy to go either way with this, as I don't see any clear downsides to either approach (task per bucket vs non-engine task).

Line:114, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> We could, as you suggest, have a new task per vBucket visit -- I just assumed the comment about the task creation overhead was still relevant. With reduced number of vBuckets this is probably even less of an issue, as you say. I can benchmark this -- creating a task vs waking up a task.

> rely on schedule order for the round-robin behaviour

Not sure about this one. If we have 200 vBuckets to visit, would we schedule 200 instances of the PagingVisitor task, each with its own ItemPagingVisitor instance for that vBucket?

> One downside is if memory drops below LWM and we have a bunch of tasks we need to clean up, but I think it's worth investigating.

The tasks should just nop if that's the case, so this should be a problem.

I believe we already have a benchmark for this - see executor_bench.cc

Note there's also some potential simplification - if the tasks already exist then that avoids having to atomically create only if someone else hasn't already.

Line:114, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Benchmarks from mancouch seem to indicate there isn't a massive difference between long-lived and one-shot tasks for CB3. In fact, one-shot seems to be slightly faster than waking up a single task from a pool of 16.

Folly does better with long-lived tasks however, which should be in favour of this  PausingVisitorAdapter.
