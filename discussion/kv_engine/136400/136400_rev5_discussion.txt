DESCRIPTION:

MB-41510: Refactor Timings class to better handle its Histograms

Refactor Timings class, to not expose pointers to its internal heap
allocated Hdr1sfMicroSecHistogram. Also update these to
std::unique_ptr<>. Update them to be guarded using a cb:RWLock over
using an std::atomic<> as this ensure that the pointer is valid though
out the usage of the pointer.

This patch also removes a small amount of redundant code.
