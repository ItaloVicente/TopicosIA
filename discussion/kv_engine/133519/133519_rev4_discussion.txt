DESCRIPTION:

Add kvlite skeleton

kvlite is a small program which offers a REST interface to the
cluster_test framework (if you want to do more manual testing /
experiments with memcached).

One of the "problems" if you want to mock around with vbucket
states on a normal installation of couchbase is that ns_server
monitors the state of the system and will try to make sure that
things are as they expect. kvlite will only start memcached
and allow you to create buckets, but once created it won't
try to monitor the vbuckets state or anything so you're
free to do whatever you want.

If you have kvlite running on a machine you can start use it
with:

    ./couchbase-cli cluster-init --cluster http://127.0.0.1:6666 \
                                 --cluster-username Administrator \
                                 --cluster-password asdfasdf \
                                 --cluster-ramsize 1024 \
                                 --services data

kvlite will ignore the parameter you specify for ramsize and won't
stop you from creating buckets which eats up more than the memory
you've got on you system.

Once initialized you can create 30 buckets with:

    for f in `seq 30`
    do
     ./couchbase-cli bucket-create \
                     --cluster http://127.0.0.1:6666 \
                     --bucket mybucket-$f \
                     --bucket-type couchbase \
                     --storage-backend couchstore \
                     --durability-min-level none \
                     --bucket-ramsize 200 \
                     --bucket-replica 0 \
                     --bucket-priority low \
                     --bucket-eviction-policy fullEviction \
                     --enable-flush 0 \
                     --enable-index-replica 0 \
                     --compression-mode off \
                     -u Administrator \
                     -p asdfasdf
   done

@todo need to return the cluster config somewhere (as we don't use
      fixed ports for memcached)
@todo add support for multinode (currently cluster-init spins up
      only a single memcached. we might want to do server-add
      and spin up additional ones if its on the same node; otherwise
      set up replication over the network etc.
