DESCRIPTION:

MB-31869: Disable FlowControl for DCP Consumer

FlowControl in EPEngine aims to something that is already enforced by
the TCP Congestion Control implementation in the OS.

Plus, in memcached we already have some form of additional flow control
in Connection::executeCommandsCallback(), where we enforce a limit on
the bufferevent userspace send-buffer (defaulted to 40MB per DCP
connection, can be updated via memcached config).
Note that the limit on the userspace send-buffer doesn't enforce any
limit on the size of the kernel socket outbound buffer. Libevent may
even drain its send-buffer by writing data to the socket, but the kernel
may not drain its socket buffer promptly, so the actual memory allocated
in the system for that connection can be higher then our bufferevent
limit.

So, we believe that FlowControl in EPE is just redundant. While it seems
that (when introduced) FlowControl had some relation with DCP Noop,
recent analysis doesn't show any side effect on that side and the DCP
Noop mechanism is expected to behaves as usual.

This patch disables FlowControl for DCP replica connections (ie,
memcached DCP Consumer only).
