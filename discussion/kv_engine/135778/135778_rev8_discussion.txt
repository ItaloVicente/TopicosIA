DESCRIPTION:

MB-31869: Disable FlowControl for DCP Consumer

FlowControl in EPEngine aims to something that is already enforced by
the TCP Congestion Control implementation in the OS.

Plus, in memcached we already have some form of additional flow control
in Connection::executeCommandsCallback(), where we enforce a limit on
the bufferevent userspace send-buffer (defaulted to 40MB per DCP
connection, can be updated via memcached config).
Note that the limit on the userspace send-buffer doesn't enforce any
limit on the size of the kernel socket outbound buffer. Libevent may
even drain its send-buffer by writing data to the socket, but the kernel
may not drain its socket buffer promptly, so the actual memory allocated
in the system for that connection can be higher then our bufferevent
limit.

So, we believe that FlowControl in EPE is just redundant.

While it seems that (when introduced) FlowControl had some relation with
DCP Noop, recent analysis doesn't show any side effect on that side and
the DCP Noop mechanism is expected to behaves as usual.

The main point on Noop is that we want to make sure that noops can fly
through and cannot be "delayed" by a full send-buffer that needs to be
drained first.

I have verified that the current behaviour is that the Consumer sets Noop
params via DcpControl to the Producer based on configuration. Currently
by default it takes 360 seconds of "delay" before we see a disconnection.
For CB <=5.0 the noop-timeout was 180 secs.

Let's consider how Noop works currenlty with FlowControl enabled:
 - Consumer acks bytes of received DCP messages
 - Producer receives bytes and drains the BufferLog
 - Producer can proceed with sending more DCP messages
 - Producer doesn't send anything because the send-buffer is full
 - At some point one peer hits the noop-timeout and we disconnect anyway

So essentially Noop triggers a disconnection based on the noop-timeout,
regardless of FlowControl.

This patch disables FlowControl for DCP replica connections (ie,
memcached DCP Consumer only).
