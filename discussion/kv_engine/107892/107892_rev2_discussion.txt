DESCRIPTION:

Remove use of ON_LOG_LEVEL

There was no clients who registered for the ON_LOG_LEVEL events
left in the system.

This patch also removes the creation of a new thread to change
the log level for the logger (this will cause the front-end thread
to block until the internals of the spdlogger is updated, but
we're expecting that to be a fast operation. If it ever hurts
your performance the workaround is simple: stop changing log
levels all the time ;-) )
