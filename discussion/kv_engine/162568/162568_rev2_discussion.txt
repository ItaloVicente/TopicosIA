MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:145, tests/testapp/testapp.h -> Consistency: I noticed you changed this to take std::string rather than const std::string&. That's fine for a test program like this, not worth worrying about unnecessary copies; _but_ you didn't change delete_object, validate_json document etc below.

If you want to change one while moving up here, suggest changing them all in a consistent way (or change none).

(Note: If you are going to change to anything, for a non-owning use of a string-like thing where we are going to serialised into a mcbp packet, std::string_view is probably the best choice as avoids any unnecessary copy on the way in...)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:145, tests/testapp/testapp.h -> I assume the key & value eventually get put into a raw buffer to go onto the network (possibly via a std::string or other owning type). As such there's probably not much value in changing to a non reference here; it only makes sense if the ultimate owning destination is a std::string which takes ownership.

If we were creating a temporary std::string just to pass via reference, then std::string_view is likely superior as doesn't require creating an expensive temporary 😊

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:145, tests/testapp/testapp.h -> In order to do that we should start cleaning up MemcachedConnection as it is currently the one blocking from doing that (there isn't an implicit conversion from std::string_view to const std::string& etc which makes it annoying to use)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:145, tests/testapp/testapp.h -> I changed it because it is moved later on. Previousy we would first create a temporary string object to be able to send it as a reference, then create another copy when it was moved.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:145, tests/testapp/testapp.h -> In store_document we must have a std::string to put into another member in the implementation. We could change this method to have std::string_view, but I don't see the need of having to go through yet another object. If we decide to refactor store_document (or the underlying implementation in MemcachedConnection) so it may operate on views we could change it at that time.

Line:145, tests/testapp/testapp.h -> Ok - thanks for explaining. I do think we should make the API consistent across the different methods, but that's not critical.
