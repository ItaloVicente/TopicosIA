DESCRIPTION:

MB-41257: Abort warmup if we're unable to get collection states

KVStore::getCollectionStats() can fail to get collection stats for other
than the reason of NOT_FOUND. However, currently the KVStore
implementations treat any error in the same way a NOT_FOUND. This can
cause us to Warmup with incorrect collection stats. If
getCollectionStats() fails to get stats for any other reason than
NOT_FOUND we should fail Warmup as otherwise we in an inconsistent
state. Furthermore, this could be indication that the storage is failing
or files on disk are corrupted.

To allow us to abort warmup if getCollectionStats() fails,
getCollectionStats() returns a std::pair<> with a bool to indicate
successful fetching of collections stats.

Its worth noting as of writing this patch, Magma gets its
collection stats in memory so won't fail if the data files are corrupted
on disk. So if makeFileHandle() passes getCollectionStats() will
succeed. This is not the case for Couchstore.

This patch also adds tests for KVStore::getCollectionStats(). But does
not add new Warmup tests as there's not way of blocking in
Warmup::loadCollectionStatsForShard() between the call to
KVStore::makeFileHandle() and KVStore::getCollectionStats().

Line:1593, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_eraser_test.cc -> If you end up doing another patchset, could maybe break this out into [success, stats] as you have in some of the other tests to minimise .first and .second stuff

Line:1159, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> OOI, wouldn't open with open mode trunc (which is the default IIRC) alone be sufficient? https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_filebuf/open https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/ios_base/openmode

Line:1593, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_eraser_test.cc -> I did but as we reuse stats var on line 1597 it ends up messing with structural bindings and IIRC doesn't compile. So using first/second seemed the cleanest way of going forward.

Line:1159, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> maybe but linux and Windows file apis behaviour in pretty different ways. I was using ASSERT_NO_THROW(fs::resize_file(dataFile, 0)); to truncate the file but this was causing the method to throw and didn't want to dig too deep give its just a test.

Line:1593, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_eraser_test.cc -> If this one were structured binding, the one below would need to be a std::tie to avoid redefining the variables. Or, both could be structured bindings if they were wrapped in scopes.

first/second is probably fine though :)

Line:1159, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> One would hope the C++ standard defined methods would play nice cross platform, but as always :windowsssss:

Though, we are using boost::filesystem here rather than std::filesystem, I assume we have some fun compatability issue with std::fs not quite usable on some platform or other? I recall we had something like that when I wanted to use from_chars somewhere... though I might re-check that in case we've updated compilers and what not.

In any case, fine as-is 👍

Line:1593, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_eraser_test.cc -> Did think about using scope but different way to cut it. Shooot thanks for the reminder about std::tie :)

Line:1159, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> Unfortunately std::filesystem isn't supported by the set of compilers that we use https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support. Was speaking to DaveR about upgrading our tool change for .next but not 100% sure if it's worth it yet + priorities and so on.
