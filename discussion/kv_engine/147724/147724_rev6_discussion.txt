DESCRIPTION:

MB-41257: Abort warmup if we're unable to get collection states

KVStore::getCollectionStats() can fail to get collection stats for other
than the reason of NOT_FOUND. However, currently the KVStore
implementations treat any error in the same way a NOT_FOUND. This can
cause us to Warmup with incorrect collection stats. If
getCollectionStats() fails to get stats for any other reason than
NOT_FOUND we should fail Warmup as otherwise we in an inconsistent
state. Furthermore, this could be indication that the storage is failing
or files on disk are corrupted.

To allow us to abort warmup if getCollectionStats() fails,
getCollectionStats() returns a std::pair<> with a bool to indicate
successful fetching of collections stats.

Its worth noting as of writing this patch, Magma gets its
collection stats in memory so won't fail if the data files are corrupted
on disk. So if makeFileHandle() passes getCollectionStats() will
succeed. This is not the case for Couchstore.

This patch also adds tests for KVStore::getCollectionStats(). But does
not add new Warmup tests as there's not way of blocking in
Warmup::loadCollectionStatsForShard() between the call to
KVStore::makeFileHandle() and KVStore::getCollectionStats().

Line:25, /COMMIT_MSG -> Magma should do local doc reads to get collection stats, just like couchstore which I imagine should go to disk.

makeFileHandle() literally just caches a vbid for magma so if it is going to fail it will fail in getCollectionStats.

Line:1534, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> if we are failing here (debatable but perhaps we should as it could break MVS snap/stream end values) then we should fail in replayPreCommitHook if we can't read them there

Line:1802, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> again, we should consistently fail (or not) in these cases

Line:2109, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> same as for couchstore, should we fail in this case?

Line:25, /COMMIT_MSG -> After testing and stepping through the code, I didn't see it going to disk but insead reading the data from the localIndex. I was able to delete/modify all the magma files after the MagmaKVStore was created and the function wouldn't fail.

Line:1534, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:1802, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:2109, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Looking more deeply into the compact function we should as we rely on to make a decision on whether we delete the on disk stats. Though I think this requires a little refactoring so that we don't do any compaction before we've got the stats. That way we can abort knowing we've not compacted any dropped collections and out stats should be still constinat to what they were before the compaction function was called.
