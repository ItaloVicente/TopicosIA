DESCRIPTION:

MB-37956: makeCollectionID/makeScopeID should use gsl::narrow<>

We currently use narrow_cast<> to cast a ManifestUid to a ScopeID or
CollectionID. But this doesn't throw if the value can't be fitted into
narrower value. So we should use gsl::narrow<> which will throw if the
value can't be fitted into the narrow value.

gsl::narrow will cast to ScopeIDType and CollectionIDType first as this
gives us the benefit of also throwing if the conversion can't be
done. Then creating a ScopeID and CollectionID object (We perform the
gsl::narrow<> to the underlying type first so that we don't need to
implement extra operators that gsl::narrow requires). Any narrowing
exceptions throw will be caught and re-thrown as an
std::invalid_argument() exception.

This issue was found as gsl::narrow_cast<> is marked noexcept in
gsl-lite 0.38.1. Which caused us to crash due to ScopeID and
CollectionID throwing in the constructor.
