DESCRIPTION:

Verify cached onDiskPrepares after compaction

MB-41747 got an insane value from onDiskPrepares and it is
unknown where the error is coming from.

The value is increased when we store the prepare to disk,
and is supposed to be reduced as part of compaction (when we
drop them) and stored into the vbstate document.

This patch verifies:

1) That the value in the local vbstate document is >= than
   what we want to subtract and insert into the header

2) After compaction has run it'll verify that the value
   is the same as the cached value.

(we're not using Expects as I'm not sure if someone will try
to catch the exception further up in the stack. I want the
program to abort so that we know the failure)
