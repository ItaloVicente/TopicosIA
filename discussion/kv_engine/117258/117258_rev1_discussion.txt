DESCRIPTION:

Remove leftover vestages of DeleteAllTask

MB-25517 (vulcan) removed dead code related to the DeleteAllTask,
however it didn't remove _all_ of the dead code - some of the
remaining state was left behind.

Specifically, note that while diskDeleteAll still exists, it is
_never_ set to true, and hence as a consequence none of the subsequent
related code ever executed.

Remove diskDeleteAll and related code.
