DESCRIPTION:

Cleanup: Create "unique" variable name in stat macro

The macro STATS_INCR1 defined a scope with a local named
thread_stats which we already had occurrences of in
other scopes causing clang-tidy to report a warning
of shadow of local variable. Rename the scoped variable
from the macro to stats_incr1_ts which should have
a low probability of already being defined ;)
