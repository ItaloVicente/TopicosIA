DESCRIPTION:

MB-33389 [SR]: Persist replicationTopology & load during warmup

Persist the replication Topology of each vBucket as part of the
vbucket_state. Load this from disk during warmup, allowing clients
(i.e. ns_server) to query the topology via the 'vbucket-details' stats
call.

All good, but missing the cleanup in KVBucket::setVBucketState_UNLOCKED().
Fine for me to merge this as it is (as we already have CV+1), I can do the cleanup as part of my open change, as you like.

I deliberately left that as we'll still need some ability to change between different DM subclasses. Let's merge for now and you can fix in your patch.
