DESCRIPTION:

MB-50602: Wait for connection close

The connection close may run on a different thead than
the thread which is serving the stats calls, so you
could end up having the stats call being served before
the connection close completed the shutdown logic.

Change-Id: I46b9945a49a84768ffda3b571ec78a4ca9f8bec7
