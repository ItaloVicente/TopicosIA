Line:446, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Maybe give a reason why we only allow memory checkpoints so when we come back to this we no not to "re-enable" it for disk snapshots.

Line:2907, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Might be cleaner to use expect throw here https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/advanced.md

Line:3676, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> This reads a little funny, and I think might have changed the test little. I wonder if we should create a disk snapshot from 0 -> 4 at the start of the test. Though I might have missed something here.

Line:1828, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> Not really sure why the HPS has changed in this test?

Line:446, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Done

Line:2907, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> EXPECT_THROW allows to check only the exception type, while it is nice to check the exact exception thrown.

Line:3676, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/durability_monitor_test.cc -> You're right, the test could be much simpler as per what you describe. The point is that all previous "addSyncWrite" steps are queueing every prepare in a dedicated Mem checkpoint, so why this step was here.
I've re-written the test

Line:1828, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/vbucket_durability_test.cc -> Look at the left side: at line 1812 the test is turning a Memory checkpoint into a Disk checkpoint, which is an invalid operation. As a side effect, in the code at ADM::updateHPS we end up with setting ADM::HPS = 3.

The CM API was improperly used in this test. By fixing that, the HPS becomes 3 only when it is supposed to do so, ie at line 1819 when ADM moves out from "null-topology".
