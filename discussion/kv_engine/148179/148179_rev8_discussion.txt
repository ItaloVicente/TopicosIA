DESCRIPTION:

MB-44852: Make CBStatCollector only format stat keys which need it

Previously CBStatCollector would attempt to call fmt::format_to on many
stat keys which don't include replacement specifiers.

This does not lead to incorrect behaviour, but may have an unnecessary
perf impact;  many keys are known ahead of time to lack "{foo}"
replacement specifiers so fmt::format_to will cost CPU time but do
nothing.

With this patch, stats.def.h can explicitly declare that a stat will
require formatting.
