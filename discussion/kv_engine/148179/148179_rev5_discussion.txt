DESCRIPTION:

MB-44852: Make CBStatCollector only format stat keys which need it

Previously CBStatCollector would attempt to call fmt::format_to on many
stat keys which don't include replacement specifiers.

This does not lead to incorrect behaviour, but may have an unnecessary
perf impact;  many keys are known ahead of time to lack "{foo}"
replacement specifiers so fmt::format_to will cost CPU time but do
nothing.

With this patch, stats.def.h can explicitly declare that a stat will
require formatting.

Line:53, include/statistics/definitions.h -> Do we need both of these operators? IIRC one std::string / std::string_view can already be converted to the other; and it's probably better to have CBStatsKey stick with non-owning std::string_view to avoid any unnecessary copies / heap allocations.

Line:126, include/statistics/definitions.h -> Do we still need both this and the following constructor? Feels like they are logically equivalent (if one is specifying Units, they can probably contruct a CBStatsKey also).

Line:159, include/statistics/definitions.h -> Similary here.

(Broadly speaking I feel it's going to be very difficult for the reader to figure out exactly which ctor is called, and what temporary / intermediate objects are created with all these ctors; without actually looking what the compiler generates).

Line:189, include/statistics/definitions.h -> Should this be const?

Line:45, statistics/cbstat_collector.cc -> Do you need the std::string_view explicit cast here? (and line 43)?

Line:83, statistics/cbstat_collector.cc -> ditto
