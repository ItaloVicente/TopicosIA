DESCRIPTION:

MB-47386: Remove the 'chk_period' config param

The param was used for enforcing checkpoint creation on a time-base.
What we want instead is being num-items/mem-usage driven on checkpoint
creation.

Note: In the current code checkpoint creation by chk_pariod is actually
prevented (in most real cases) by that we allow only max 2 checkpoints
in the CheckpointList.

Line:1205, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> @daver, @james

Here we say that we create a new ckpt:

1. If high mem usage (which is what forceCreation is only used for, see code in CM)
2. OR, If open checkpoint is too big (num-item based)
3. OR, If open checkpoint too old (time based)

In this patch we are already in a world where ckpt mem-usage is capped. So removing (3) leaves us with a logic that already implements what we want: ie, closing the current checkpoint (and making it eligible for removal) if we need to attempt ckpt mem recovery. Ckpt mem recovery that is now all based on the new CM quota and thresholds.

A time-based trigger doesn't really do anything anyway if mem-recovery is not necessary. You close the current checkpoint and create a new one, but we would just leave the closed checkpoint there in the CkptRemover task.

Note: (1) is currently broken. Also, the (broken) Bucket-quota condition must be replaced with the new CM-quota condition. So what I'm doing here is fixing (1) in a dedicated patch and then rebasing this on top of it.
