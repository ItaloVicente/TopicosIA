DESCRIPTION:

MB-52067: Ensure bgfetch does not short circuit multi-phase ops

Increment is implemented with a SteppableCommandContext.
If any phase receives status `would_block`, the subsequent
notify_io_complete call _must_ provide `success` if the steppable
context needs to run again.

Any other status will result in a corresponding response being written
and any remaining stages of the command context being skipped.

If operations overlap, a bgfetch may complete but not find a temporary
item in the HashTable (also possible if the paging visitor removes the
temp item). Previously, if the item was not found on disk this could
lead to the cookie being notified with no_such_key, potentially ending
a command with an unexpected no_such_key response.

To avoid this specific case, this patch ensures bgfetches which:

* don't find the item on disk
* don't find a temp item in the HT

notifies the cookie with success.

This is not entirely new behaviour - if a temp item _is_ found, the
cookie is already notified with success, relying on the operation
to re-run and find the temp non existent item.

This does introduce inefficiency - multiple concurrent GETs for the
same key might now wastefully trigger repeated bgfetches.
To resolve this, a future patch _may_ prevent GETs cleaning up temp
items (as the ItemPager will do so eventually).

Line:190, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> So if I understand (eg) for INCR we used to miss the if-block because the operation doesn't set ValueFilter::KEYS_ONLY in the filter.

Do we know why the check by ValueFilter::KEYS_ONLY was there originally?
Is it possible that this change makes some unintended code path to flow into the block?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Indeed - I hoped to do that, but driving a testapp level test but controlling bgfetches is a bit grim.

I can add an ArithmeticTest level test and drive ewb, though that'll just confirm "it breaks if I poke it to break it", but not really guard against bgfetches actually _causing_ it to break.
Line:167, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> I can comment that additionally, but this was to warn that if the temp item is _not_ there to cas-check, it isn't safe to just add one (with a cas of choice) and continue onwards

Line:190, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> I recall digging into this when I refactored a bit of this some time ago, was added originally for MB-14859.

 Is it possible that this change makes some unintended code path to flow into the block?

Possible, yes - but if such a bit of code exists which would break if they entered this then we have two incompatible expectations about bgfetch - SteppableCommandContext requires that it does _not_. I'm not aware of anywhere which functionally requires notifyIOComplete(no_such_key) in this situation; everything which triggers bgfetches should look at the HashTable state after.

Line:5821, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> See, I _knew_ it existed somewhere... Clearly I didn't search well enough, or maybe I found it and got bamboozled - that inherits from STParameterizedBucketTest but doesn't have ST in the name, Done!

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:167, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> I think it's worth updating, it isn't "likely" that we risk consistency issues if we add a new SV and then complete the fetch with the current value from disk, it's a guaranteed (that we _risk_ consistency issues, not that we actually have one). 

I'd also add on to that that we don't add a new SV and trigger a new fetch here because the code to do that already exists in the normal frontend path, so we instead do nothing and just run the op again.
