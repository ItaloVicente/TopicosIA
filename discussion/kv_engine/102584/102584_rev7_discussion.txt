DESCRIPTION:

MB-32327: Add support for Sync Writes to VBucket / CheckpointManager

Add support for ep-engine mutation methods (store/store_if/remove) to
specify durabilty requirements.

- Pass these durability requirements down to the specific VBucket.
- Insert into the HashTable as pending mutations.
- Queue them into the CheckpointManager as pending sync writes.

This allows a client to issue SET/ADD/REPLACE requests including
durability requirements and have it queued into the active
VBucket. However at present the pending sync write will never commit;
as no integration info DurabilityMonitor yet.
