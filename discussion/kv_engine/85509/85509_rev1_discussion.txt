DESCRIPTION:

RocksDB: Skip 'test_memory_condition' in 'ep_testsuite'

The 'test_memory_condition' requires full control on how memory is
allocated by the underlying store. We do not have that yet for RocksDB.
In particular, depending on the configuration RocksDB pre-allocates
default-size blocks of memory in the internal Arena, before any DB is
actually opened.
