Move the method implementations of Request, Response and
Header from the header files to the .cc file and move from struct
to class (later on we'll make the members private)

Line:220, include/mcbp/protocol/response.h -> I'd probably argue we should keep much of these (if not all) inline - they are all simple address / size calculations (single statement) such that the cost of setting up call() instruction will be greater (in code size / execution footprint) than /not/ inlining them.

Given we don't safe much else from de-inlining them (no fewer headers etc) I think it's best to leave these as is; we'll be slowing the code down otherwise.

Line:220, include/mcbp/protocol/response.h -> They are gone in a later patch I'm currently doing to make all these common in the header class...

Line:220, include/mcbp/protocol/response.h -> Ok - if the trivial methods come back as inline in the common Header class that's fine.
