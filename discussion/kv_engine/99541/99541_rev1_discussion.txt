DESCRIPTION:

MB-30916: Introduce the new CheckpointBench fixture

This commit adds also the newQueueDirtyWithManyClosedUnrefCheckpoints
benchmark.

In that test I want to measure resource contention between a mc::worker
(front-end thread) adding incoming mutations to the CheckpointManager
and the ClosedUnrefCheckpointRemoverTask when the number of checkpoints
eligible for removing is high.

Contention is on the CM::queueLock. If the RemTask performs some slow
operation under queueLock, then a front-end thread may wait a long time
before acquiring the lock. That would lead to throughput degradation.

At the time when I create this benchmark I'm fixing a throughput
regression that I caused by changing the scope of the queueLock in
the RemTask. That led to freeing checkpoint memory (which is a slow
operation) under queueLock.

Bench run output with at current stage (regression):
