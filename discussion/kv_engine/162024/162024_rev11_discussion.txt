DESCRIPTION:

MB-48506: Introduce CheckpointCursor::distance

The current splice(range) operation that we perform at ItemExpel is
O(N) in the size of the expelled range, so actually O(N) in the size of
the Checkpoint::toWrite list.

For making that splice O(1) we can turn toWrite from std::list to
boost::container::list and use the Boost splice(range, distance) API.
But for using that we need the distance, which is logically the
std::distance(range.begin(), range.end()).

That is where CheckpointCursor::distance comes from.
The new cursor member tracks the distance between the current cursor
position and Checkpoint::toWrite.begin().
Given that ItemExpel always removes from the beginning of toWrite to
the item pointed by the lowest curosr (excluded), than the
CheckpointCursor::distance of the lowest cursor (whatever cursor is the
lowest at the time of expel) is exactly what we need.

CheckpointCursor::distance implemented and fully tested in this patch
but not used yet.
