DESCRIPTION:

MB-36948: ActiveStream track maxVisibleSeqno for in-memory snapshot

As the ActiveStream transfers items from the checkpoint to the
readyQueue, check if the item is committed, and if so update
a maxVisibleSeqno which will then be added to the SnapshotMarker
response message.

Updates a number of unit tests to inspect the snapshot-marker.
A number of those expects will change once the backfill passes
the maxVisibleSeq through.
