DESCRIPTION:

MB-25342: Add Collections::VB::Manifest::CachingReadHandle

The caching readhandle allows limited read access to the manifest
but fits into the functional flow of front-end operations.

When constructing the CachingReadHandle from a key, the key is scanned
and a map lookup is performed. The result of the lookup is saved so
that further down the code path, subsequent isLogicallyDeleted checks
don't need to scan the key again and perform another map lookup.

Functionality looks good; just a couple of documentation-related things.
Line:229, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> I guess this is the cached state - if this !end() then we can check if it's valid? Maybe add a brief comment to the variable?

Line:571, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Maybe document how this differs to the previous lockCollections method?

Line:198, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Suggestion - it might be worth taking a copy of the key which we have "acquired" - this would simplify a bunch of a callers in your subsequent patches as we wouldn't need a pass both the ReadHandle and the DocKey down; and moreover would remove any possibility of them being inconstant when they are used.
