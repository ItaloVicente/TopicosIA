DESCRIPTION:

MB-25342: Add Collections::VB::Manfiest::CachingReadHandle

The caching readhandle allows limited read access to the manifest
but fits into the functional flow of front-end operations.

When constructing the CachingReadHandle from a key, the key is scanned
and a map lookup is performed. The result of the lookup is saved so
that further down the code path, subsequent isLogicallyDeleted checks
don't need to scan the key and perform a map lookup.
