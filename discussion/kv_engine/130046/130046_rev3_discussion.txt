DESCRIPTION:

MB-37009: DcpProducer::handleResponse, don't disconnect on KeyEexists

DcpProducer shouldn't disconnect on status code
cb::mcbp::Status::KeyEexists. As this is returned by
DcpConsumer::lookupStreamAndDispatchMessage(), when the stream found
for the op's vbucket has an opaque that does not match the op's
opaque. This can occur during rebalance due to stream takeover and
thus we don't want to tear down all the streams because it's likely a
vbucket is being moved to another node or has changed state.
