DESCRIPTION:

MB-50423: Allow PagingVisitor to remove deleted item metadata

If a request needs to read a deleted value's body (e.g., to read system
xattrs), the delete is bgfetched back into the HashTable.

After this, under value eviction only the value could be evicted -
there was no mechanism to remove the deleted value metadata, other than
overwriting the document or recreating the vbucket. It could remain in
memory long after the tombstone has been purged from disk.

To resolve this, allow the PagingVisitor to remove deleted StoredValues
from the HT, even under value eviction.

This does not fundamentally change how deletes are handled; once a
delete is persisted it is removed from the HT entirely anyway, and only
bgfetched if needed.

(cherry picked from commit 870c1993c763b9c4c810f8b0b75236ece3858919)
