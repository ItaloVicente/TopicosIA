DESCRIPTION:

Allow runCurrentTask to accept TaskId

A number of tests use the FakeExecutorPool to run the next task on a
queue; checking it equals the expected task. Currently this method
(runCurrentTask) requires the task description - a textual string - is
specified.

For some Tasks the description is variable; and it is
desirable to simply specify the Task type
(e.g. TaskId::ActiveStreamCheckpointProcessorTask).

Add a new overload of runCurrentTask, along with associated changes in
ExecutorThread to expose the TaskId.
