DESCRIPTION:

MB-53053: Add CrossBucketVisitorAdapter for cross-bucket visitation

The CrossBucketVisitorAdapter can be passed in a list (map) of
bucket -> visitor. The visitors are wrapped in an
SingleSteppingVisitorAdapter, which is a GlobalTask which visits one
VBucket and pauses. The cross-bucket adapter will then wake up each
individual bucket's visitors either in a sequential or round-robin
fashion until all visitors have completed.

The plan is to use this cross-bucket visitor adapter to run the
PagingVisitor tasks across multiple buckets in a fair way.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:118, engines/ep/src/cross_bucket_visitor_adapter.cc -> Hmmm - could any single stepping visitors be run "out of sequence" when their engine shuts down (deregistering the taskable will wake them)?

If so, could we end up with multiple single stepping visitors running unexpectedly? The woken task doesn't really matter because it's engine is going away so it running and exiting seems fine, but would it trigger the "next" task, even if some other, currently running, single stepping visitor is supposed to do that?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:118, engines/ep/src/cross_bucket_visitor_adapter.cc -> Good catch! The engine shutting down would have caused exactly what you describe. 
I've changed how this is handled now -- instead of trying to detect the state of the engine (which is racy), check whether the task that completed is the one we scheduled (expectedTask). 

If not (woken up by the engine shutdown), remove it from the list of managed tasks.
