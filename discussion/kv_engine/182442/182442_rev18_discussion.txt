DESCRIPTION:

MB-53053: Add CrossBucketVisitorAdapter for cross-bucket visitation

The CrossBucketVisitorAdapter can be passed in a list (map) of
bucket -> visitor. The visitors are wrapped in an
SingleSteppingVisitorAdapter, which is a GlobalTask which visits one
VBucket and pauses. The cross-bucket adapter will then wake up each
individual bucket's visitors either in a sequential or round-robin
fashion until all visitors have completed.

The plan is to use this cross-bucket visitor adapter to run the
PagingVisitor tasks across multiple buckets in a fair way.
