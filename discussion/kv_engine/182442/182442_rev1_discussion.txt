DESCRIPTION:

MB-53053: Add CrossBucketVisitorAdapter for cross-bucket visitation

The CrossBucketVisitorAdapter can be passed in a list (map) of
bucket -> visitor. The visitors are wrapped in an PausingVisitorAdapter,
which is a GlobalTask which visits one VBucket and pauses. The
cross-bucket adapter will then wake up each individual bucket's visitors
either in a sequential or round-robin fashion until all visitors have
completed.

The plan is to use this cross-bucket visitor adapter to run the
PagingVisitor tasks across multiple buckets in a fair way.
