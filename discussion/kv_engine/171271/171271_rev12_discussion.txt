DESCRIPTION:

MB-51556: Use new Monotonic labels

Move instances of Monotonic<> that use labels which stored in static
memory and can have a lambda to process the label name to add extra
information to them.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:932, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Bit of a wacky suggestion, but if we want to associate each monotonic with a "parent", we could use something like

https://github.com/cctbx/boost/blob/master/boost/intrusive/parent_from_member.hpp

Then the monotonic can find the containing CheckpointManager from its own ptr, because it knows it's offset within the parent.

That could potentially be paired with an ADL function - like

 ATOMIC_MONOTONIC(type, policy, CheckpointManager, name);
 ATOMIC_MONOTONIC(type, policy, ActiveStream, name);
 
 
and elsewhere (something like)

 std::string to_label(const CheckpointManager& m) {
     // return the formatted thing
 }
 
 
  std::string to_label(const ActiveStream& as) {
     // return the formatted thing
 }
 
Then the monotonic stores nothing - though that doesn't get a per monotonic label...
maybe the macro could also specialise a trait to go from member ptr to a string name for it? That might be pushing what's reasonable to bother with, but then the monotonic has:

* The parent type
* The parent object
* A string version of the member name

and doesn't actually store any extra data at runtime!

Though it may well be more complexity than it's worth :P

Line:932, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> I have tried something like this already, as you can kind of do it just using raw ptrs and templated methods. However, you end up requiring that a monotonic must have a parent class (as you pointed out). Which isn't great if you ever want to change at run time what the function does or if the monotonic<> doesn't have a parent class/struct, which we kind of do when we have montonic<> stored within a std::vector which are subject to the data for the label being changed e.g. a monotnic<> that stores a seqno for node in the DM.

Thanks for the boost link btw hadn't come across it before.

Line:942, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> I see

 #include <boost/preprocessor/facilities/overload.hpp>
 
over in 

 https://review.couchbase.org/c/platform/+/171269/14/include/platform/monotonic.h


- could that not be used to dispatch to the right numbered macro?

Line:942, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Indeed I used it in an earlier patch, however (https://review.couchbase.org/c/platform/+/171269/11..14/include/platform/monotonic.h#b301) Dave found the macro overly complex and non obvious to the reader (partly given all the extra IFDEF need for to handle MSVC vs GCC/CLANG) so it was decided to just go for the number arg method.
