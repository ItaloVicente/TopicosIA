DESCRIPTION:

MB-51556: Use new Monotonic labels

Move instances of Monotonic<> that use labels which stored in static
memory and can have a lambda to process the label name to add extra
information to them.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I think this patch is too large, changing all the different labels in a single patch. It's difficult to review when trying to understand which Labeller class is used where. Suggest breaking into some smaller patches; maybe the simple ones first then the more complex Durability labellers in their own patch?
Line:22, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Let's not pull the format header into here if not already used - getLabel can be made non-inline.

Line:930, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> I don't think this is a particulary good name:

- firstly it's overly appreviated - without some additional context "ChkptManLb" could be a library, load balancer, etc.
- secondly it's a nested class within CheckpointManager; so the 'ChkptMan' part is redundant.

If this is going to be an inner class I'd just name it `Labeller' or similar.

Line:932, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Have you experimented with using brace initialisation when we construct an object of this class? I think you should be able to avoid the explicit constructor (and just make `vbid` public and const), which gets rid of some of the boilerplate to use the labellers.

Line:933, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> As per platform patch, `l` is arguably too terse; plus I think we settled on the term 'name' there?

Line:151, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Looks like we have lost the ActiveStream name here? Can we put that back in the Labeller?

Line:584, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> As before, if this is an inner class then 'ActiveStream' is redundant.

Line:586, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> As before, I think you can avoid explicitly defining a ctor.

Line:130, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> Again - I mean you might as well have just randomly bashed the keyboard at this stage ;)

We can drop the ADM prefix as per previous; then I'd make sure the name is something readable.

Line:316, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> As previous.

Line:319, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> I think these constructors are getting confusing - we have two different two-arg constructors which result in quite different behaviour.

I would suggest just always printing the same format of string (which yes is a change to the previous behaviour but I don't think that's worth getting hung up over), and look at

Line:319, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> ... simplifying the class.

Line:751, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> `name`

Line:804, engines/ep/src/durability/durability_monitor_impl.h -> I'm a little nervous about holding a ptr to a (dynamic) string - iirc we change the node labels (and delete the underlying objects) as and when topology changes. Are we confident we always update the label before the node string goes out of scope?

*edit* looking at where you get the string from; this is invalid - the underlying string you are pointing to can be moved if the std::unordered_map is resized - see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map/emplace

Line:550, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Are these correct? Shouldn't there be some mention this is a lastWriteSeqno?
Similar for the HCS one...

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This patch will be split out into multiple parts which will be committed after platform us been updated.
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Ack I'll split out the patches though we'll need to remove all the labels first then re-add them in
