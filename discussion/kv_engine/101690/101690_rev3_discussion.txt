Line:134, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> Given I don't think there's any need for more than 65536millseconds of timeout; worth limiting this length to 2 bytes (simplifying validation etc?)

We could also allow the timeout to be omitted (len=1) which means use server default (and saving 1 byte).

Line:134, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> So you would prefer that it is either 1 or 3 bytes? (the suggested encoding would save 1 byte if you wanted 254ms for instance).. I don't mind too much either way

Line:134, docs/BinaryProtocol.md -> Sure, the seems fine - 1B if you use server default timeout; 3B if you want to specify.

(I think adding 3B to SyncWrite mutations - which have got a value in them etc is fine).
