DESCRIPTION:

MB-50291: Eph::getPageableMemHighWatermark - handle zero active VBs

When investigating MB-48070, it was observed that the Ephemeral memory
recovery tasks (Eph tombstone hashtable cleaner, Eph tombstone stale
item deleter) are running constantly during a number of
ep_testsuite_dcp tests.  Investigation found that these tests only
have a single vBucket in the replica state (no active vBuckets).

When checking to see if memory should be recovered (via
KVBucket::checkAndMaybeFreeMemory), the lack of any active vBuckets
causes EphemeralBucket::getPageableMemHighWatermark() to return 0 -
i.e. indicating that memory recovery should be attempted if there is
any memory used:

    // Trigger memory reduction (ItemPager) if we've exceeded the pageable high
    // watermark.
    void KVBucket::checkAndMaybeFreeMemory() {
        if (getPageableMemCurrent() > getPageableMemHighWatermark()) {
            attemptToFreeMemory();
        }
    }

When attemptToFreeMemory() is called and the aforementioned memory
recovery tasks are run, they essentially find nothing to free. However
the next call to checkAndMaybeFreeMemory results in the same - i.e. we
end up pointlessly consuming NonIO threads attempting to recover
memory when there is nothing to do.

Note while this scenario (zero active, >0 replica) vBuckets is
unlikely to occur in a real system, it is possible during a failover
scenario. Additionally this scenario occurs frequently in unit tests;
resulting in tests taking much longer than necessary (particulary
under sanitizers).

Fix by returning the full quota is no active vBuckets are present, in
a similar way to how we handle zero vBuckets at all being present.
