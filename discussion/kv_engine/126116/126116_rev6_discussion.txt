DESCRIPTION:

MB-37374: Add new IncludeDeleteXattr flag at DCP_OPEN

The new flag is stored in a new member in ConnHandler.
With this patch, at DCP_OPEN:
 - we don't do anything at Producer
 - we store the flag at Consumer

Given that 6.6 Producers need to support pre-6.6 Consumers, then the
Consumer (in 6.6) is responsible for enabling the new feature at
Producer.

That will be implented in a follow-up patch as a new step in the
Producer-Consumer negotiation via DCP_CONTROL.
