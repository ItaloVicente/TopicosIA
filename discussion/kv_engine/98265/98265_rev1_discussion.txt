DESCRIPTION:

MB-30532: Exploit that a replica-checkpoint is never empty

CheckpointManager::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint is called only by
PassiveStream::handleSnapshotEnd. That implies that the current open
checkpoint must contain at least one mutation (the snapshot-end
mutation) when the called is performed.

Thus, we can remove from CM::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint all the logic that
is executed if (openCkpt.getNumItems() == 0), which is never verified.
