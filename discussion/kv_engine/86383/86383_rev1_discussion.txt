DESCRIPTION:

MB-27105 [RocksDB] Set the baseline size of the 'local' CF to 4KB

The 'local' Column Family contains only a few data compared to the other
CFs, but on a long running cluster the 'local' Memtable will be filled
up to the maximum (currently all the CFs are set to the same maximum).
This may lead to a lot of memory allocated for the 'local' Memtable.
To prevent this, we set the baseline size the 'local' Memtable to 4KB.
