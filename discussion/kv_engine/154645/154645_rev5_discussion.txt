DESCRIPTION:

MB-46604: Use folly executor for phosphor tracing [5/5]

Remove the homegrown executor service and use the folly
CPU executor for formatting the phosphor trace dumps.

This patch temporarily disables the automatic purging of old
trace dumps, but manually trigger a check every time one
tries to request one.

The automatic purge will be added after we've promoted the
executor service from ep-engine to the core.
