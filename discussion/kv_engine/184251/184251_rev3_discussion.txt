DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: ItemPager::createVBucketFilter returns nullopt for no match

...because an empty VBucketFilter is actually matches all vBuckets.

This refactor also exposed an undersirable behaviour which was depended
on by one of the tests, and has been relied upon since the test has
existed -- if there are no vBuckets in an evictable state, item pager
used to attempt to evict items from all vBuckets, because the empty
VBucketFilter that it had matched everything. The dead vBucket in that
test was ignored as expected, because the pauseResumeVisit code checks
whether the bucket is dead, but importantly, the item pager kept
rescheduling.

This is no longer the case. Added a workaround to trigger the item pager
as the test expected.

Line:52, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> Hmmm - it would be nice if we could flip empty to be "matches nothing" for simplicity, but we definitely rely on the current behaviour in lots of places, so I'm fine with optional for this here 👍

Line:66, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> might be more idiomatic to check:

 if (filter.empty()) {
     return {};
 }

Line:52, engines/ep/src/item_pager.cc -> Ack. We do need a cleanup of VBucketFilter in the future. Some of the methods will be unused after the later changes in the chain.
