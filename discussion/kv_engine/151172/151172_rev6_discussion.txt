DESCRIPTION:

Fix mctiming's short form file argument -f

Fix mctiming's short form file argument '-f' currently this doesn't work
as it needs to be specified as part of 'optstring' for getops_long(). To
fix this add 'f:' to the end of the string which tells getops_long() to
expect '-f' arg, which must have an argument.

Also take this as an opportunity to move long_options[] to a
std::array<> to remove clang-tidy warning.
