DESCRIPTION:

MB-32670 [3/4]: Enhance BGFetcher to support fetching compressed values

Update the BGFetcher and KVStore::getMulti code to request that an
item is fetched in compressed form if possible, by expanding the
current boolean GetMetaOnly parameter to a ValueFilter ternary:
KEYS_ONLY, VALUE_COMPRESSED or VALUE_DECOMPRESSED.

Encapsulate the vb_bgfetch_item_ctx_t class so the logic of selecting
the filter for a given key is handled by the class itself - also
remove unnecessary logic which was setting the value / status of a
bgFetch through the `value` pointer multiple times.

Note this functionality is currently unused in the front-end -
bgFetches for value currently only still uses VALUES_DECOMPRESSED.
