DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Store the packet in the cookie

The cookie represents a single command so it should contain
the packet data for the actual command. Given that we (currently)
read all of the data into a shared buffer (possibly containing
multiple commands) we don't want to move the ownership of the
data into the cookie (that would mean having to split that
buffer).
