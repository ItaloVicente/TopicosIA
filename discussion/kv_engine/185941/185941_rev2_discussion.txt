DESCRIPTION:

MB-54729: DcpProducerConfig default ctor creates replication config

Update DcpProducerConfig so that the default construction yields the
most modern set of features - those that would be in use for
replication.

The main intention of this change is to provide a path for disabling
FlatBuffers for a follow-up unit test.
