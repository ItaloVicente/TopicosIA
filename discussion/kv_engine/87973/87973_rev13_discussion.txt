DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: Link HdrHistogram_c library with ep_engine

Make the HdrHistogram_c header files available to ep_engine.  Also make
the HdrHistogram_c library available to the ep_engine library and
ep-engine_ep_unit_tests.

Also includes a basic test which makes uses of the HdrHistogram_c
library functionality.

Note: The library is linked statically because when compiled for Windows
the library did not produce a .lib and hence could not be linked.
