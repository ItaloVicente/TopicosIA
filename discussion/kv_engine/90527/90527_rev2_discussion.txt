DESCRIPTION:

MB-28289: Allow GetFailoverLog on a regular-MCBP connection

Currently GetFailoverLog is a DCP command, thus a client needs to open
a DCP connection to get the failover log for a given VBucket.
Also, the DCP GetFailoverLog command requires the client to open a
DcpProducer on the node; the connection is closed otherwise.
We introduce a new MCBP GetFailoverLog command so that a client can
retrieve the Failover Log for a given VBucket via a regular MBCP
(non-DCP) connection. We keep the old DCP command for backward
compatibility.
