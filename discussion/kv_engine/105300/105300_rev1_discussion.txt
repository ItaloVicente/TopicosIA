Trond, DaveR - can you see if the one CV failure is meaningful? I can't really imagine how it could be but I don't know the code well.

There's insufficient information in the current patch to tell if this is the correct fix - the problem isn't linked from an MB or included in the description.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> What MB is this trying to fix?

Please also include details  of the actual problem (or at least link to the MB which describes them).

Line:104, engines/ep/management/mc_bin_client.py -> The problem here seems to be in the caller - it doesn't make any sense to use type `bytes` for a human-readable message.

The caller should instead ensure it passes a string as `msg`.

Line:104, engines/ep/management/mc_bin_client.py -> The problem is there were a lot of potential callers, and in python2 this "worked". So it made more sense and was safer to protect this function.

I'm not in a position to track down all the callers; if you'd prefer to do that I could assign the review to you or someone else in KV.

Line:104, engines/ep/management/mc_bin_client.py -> Actually, given that subprocess returns both stdout and stderr as bytes by default, Python 3 has already made the determination that human-readable messages will be relayed as bytes.  Python 3 is trying to account for the fact that ASCII is not the default character set for the world, and returning bytes makes perfect sense when looked at from that viewpoint, I'm afraid.

Line:104, engines/ep/management/mc_bin_client.py -> I don't think that stdout / stderr being bytes says anything about human-readable format. stdout is very commonly used for binary data (classic unix pipeline model). The same is true for any FD - which is just a generic stream of bytes.

Note that ASCII has nothing to do with it - `str` is unicode-capable in Python3, and hence can represent any human-readable sequence of characters.

In fact, Python3 says the exact _opposite_ of what you're saying - for example from: https://portingguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/strings.html

> Text contains human-readable messages, represented as a sequence of Unicode codepoints. 

> Bytes or bytestring is a binary serialization format suitable for storing data on disk or sending it over the wire.

If you look at the Python exception class as a specific example it backs this up - it talks about 'strings' for the extra message field used to describe details of the exception to the user.

Well, for a start can you detail at least one problem this is causing? It's hard to review a fix when the problem it is trying to fix isn't clear.

> I'm not in a position to track down all the callers; if you'd prefer to do that I could assign the review to you or someone else in KV.

I was under the impression the tools team had taken responsibility for the Python3 conversion. Is that not the case?

Line:104, engines/ep/management/mc_bin_client.py -> From https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html in the CompletedProcess class section:

    stdout
    Captured stdout from the child process. A bytes sequence, or a string if run() was called with an encoding, errors, or text=True. None if stdout was not captured.

    If you ran the process with stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, stdout and stderr will be combined in this attribute, and stderr will be None.

    stderr
    Captured stderr from the child process. A bytes sequence, or a string if run() was called with an encoding, errors, or text=True. None if stderr was not captured.

So the default for subprocess is to return bytes, unless additional parameters are set.

Line:104, engines/ep/management/mc_bin_client.py -> Wow, completely misread Dave's response; ignore the subprocess quote.  Yes, the caller should honestly be handling this, but tracing back to all potential callers is a difficult task at best.  While it's the right solution, with code completion nearing, the less-than-optimal solution Ceej is proposing should be enough to get things running properly again.  I suspect later revisions could be done to the code, though my personal feeling would be it should all be gone over much more thoroughly and made to align with current Python practices.

Hmm, ok. To my knowledge all the change to kv_engine have been done by yourself or Ken - there are no changes under Carlos' name to kv_engine.
