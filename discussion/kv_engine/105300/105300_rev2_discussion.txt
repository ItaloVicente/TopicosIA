I created an MB with the details of the error I was correcting, and why  I think this is the best solution.

I'm not exactly sure who is on the Tools Team, but I'm not aware that they had taken ownership of the entirety of the python3 conversion. To be honest that wouldn't make sense anyway; they're likely in no better a position to dig into the bowels of KV code than Build is.

Sorry, I mis-typed - I meant "build team" when I said "tools team".

In that case, no, we haven't said we'd take ownership of all changes. We are driving the effort, and doing what parts of it make sense such as mechanical code changes and build/installer modifications. But we do need to ask devs to step in when the code is doing things we don't fully understand. Carlos made a number of good changes in the KV code so far, for instance.
