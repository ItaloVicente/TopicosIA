DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Enhance memory tracking for write cache

The current memory tracking for write cache exposes a bug in kv_engine
where replication will block when there are large changes to the amount
of memory that the storage engine uses. Since the entire write cache
will always be used, we've switched to reserving the memory when magma
is first opened and only calling the ObjectRegistry Allocated and
Deallocated routines when magma exceeds the reserved amount.
