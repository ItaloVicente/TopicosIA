DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Check for cancellation when RangeScan goes idle

The function changing to Idle considered Cancelled a bad input
state, this is incorrect as a scan can change to Cancelled whilst
it's Continuing and in the window where the scan is yielding or
at the limit (going Idle).

This commit changes the idle state path to accept Cancelled and
ensure any visible status is updated if we have been Cancelled.
