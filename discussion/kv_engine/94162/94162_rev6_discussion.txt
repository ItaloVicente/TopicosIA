DESCRIPTION:

MB-29675: Remove ExecutorThread taskLog & slowLog

ExecutorThread contains two ring buffers detailing the name, type and
runtime of:

a) The last 80 tasks executed.

b) the last 80 "slow" tasks (ones which exceed their expected
   runtime).

However these logs are now of limited value:

- They only record a very small number of elements (particulary the
  'taskLog'), the information is typically of little use by the time
  it's captured in stats.

- The information is presented in a separate stats block (with a
  different timestamp format), making it hard to correlate back to the
  main memcached log (which is typically needed to actually make use
  of the information).

- The cost of logging is non-zero - for each recorded log element,
  there is one memory allocation for std::string, potentially an
  additional allocation when appending the description to the task
  name.

Now we have Phosphor tracing in KV-Engine, the taskLog/slowLog don't
really add anything - Phosphor provides ~400,000 events in the default
20MB trace buffer; and has an extremly low cost - no per-event memory
allocation.

As such; remove the taskLogs.
