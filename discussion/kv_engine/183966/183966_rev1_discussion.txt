DESCRIPTION:

MB-54553: Flusher deduplication skips history-enabled collections

Item::canDeduplicate (set for items that belong to collections that
enable history) is used for determining whether dedup needs to be
skipped at persistence.

Currently verified in unit tests by looking at the resulting
"magma_NSets" stat.

An interesting aspect to mention is that (differently to what happens
for the in-memory deduplication in checkpoints) at persistence we are
able to apply the proper deduplication perfectly at item level, meaning
that the presence of historical collections doesn't have any side
effect on non-historical collections. Behaviour verified in unit tests
too.
