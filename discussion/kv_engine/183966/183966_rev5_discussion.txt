DESCRIPTION:

MB-54553: Flusher deduplication skips history-enabled collections

Item::canDeduplicate (set for items that belong to collections that
enable history) is used for determining whether dedup needs to be
skipped at persistence.

Currently verified in unit tests by looking at the resulting
"magma_NSets" stat.

An interesting aspect to mention is that (differently from what happens
for the in-memory deduplication in checkpoints) at persistence we are
able to apply the proper deduplication behaviour perfectly at item
level, meaning that the presence of historical collections doesn't have
any side effect on non-historical collections. Behaviour verified in
unit tests too.
