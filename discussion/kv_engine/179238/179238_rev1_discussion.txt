DESCRIPTION:

Enable KVStoreTest GetBySeqno for non-couchstore

GetBySeqno is supported by Magma (and Nexus:couchstore+magma), so
enable this test for additional configs.

Requires a small tweak to Snappy check, as Magma doesn't return
snappy-compressed values if the original stored value was not
compressed.
