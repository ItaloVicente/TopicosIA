DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Implement getVBucketState and snapshotVBucket for magma

The initial implementation of magma only used the cached version of
vbstate. This checkin actually persists vbstate to the local DB.

Magma requires an additional data structure MagmaInfo to track things
that are normally tracked in couchstore. MagmaInfo is stored with
vbstate data in the localDB but in separate caches.

This checkin can't actually persist things to the local DB yet because
we haven't implemented set which creates the KVSTore. But this checkin
lays the groundwork for all other documents stored in the local DB
including all the collection documents.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> This sentence appears to contradict that at lines 9..10. Could you clarify exactly what the scope of this patch is, and what behaviour is expected to work / not work?

Line:925, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Silently changing the state to dead (and resetting all information) seems like a bad idea. I suggest at least logging an error, and also returning a nullptr back so the caller so they know something went wrong.

I'd also suggest distinguishing in the log between failing to read the local doc from disk, and failing to decode it.

It might be simpler (and more in line with CouchKVStore) to populate the cached states in the ctor (via initialise() in CouchKVStore's case) - that way you can simply fail the object creation by throwing an exception.

(As an aside,  you could probably remove all the caching here to simplify things - couchstore does this because it has no block cache (and it always opens / closed the couchstore file on each access). IIRC Magma /does/ have it's own block cache, so it's probably simpler (and likely similar performance) to just always read from magma.)

Line:925, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Interestingly, if look at the path of snapshotVBucket, if getVBucketState returned a nullptr, that passes an empty structure thru setVBucketState->saveVBState and ends up doing I don't know what with nlohmann::json j=vbstate, so not sure what gets stored in local db.
If you look at the other cases of calls to getVBucketState, you get 1 of 3 things...
* ignored
* throw exception
* in case of rollback, it would crash cause we don't check

I'll try and figure out when its appropriate to throw an exception.
BTW... magma-kvstore does something similar to CouchKVStore::initialize() at the end of MagmaKVStore constructor which is probably where an exception should be done.
