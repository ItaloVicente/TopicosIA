DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Implement getVBucketState and snapshotVBucket for magma

The initial implementation of magma only used the cached version of
vbstate. This checkin actually persists vbstate to the local DB.

Magma requires an additional data structure MagmaInfo to track things
that are normally tracked in couchstore. MagmaInfo is stored with
vbstate data in the localDB but in separate caches.

This checkin can't actually persist things to the local DB yet because
we haven't implemented set which creates the KVSTore. But this checkin
lays the groundwork for all other documents stored in the local DB
including all the collection documents.
