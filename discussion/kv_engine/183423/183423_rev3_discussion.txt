DESCRIPTION:

MB-52823: Disable test of TLS1[.1] for OpenSSL 3

It seems like TLS 1 and TLS 1.1 is disabled by default
on OpenSSL 3.0 (at least on Ubuntu 22.04)

Change-Id: I34bb5b24fdc92a4d79acdc2286c2403c8a616172

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I don't think we should just blindly disable these tests for OpenSSL 3. From the migration guide[1] it doesn't mention that TLS 1.0 & 1.1 have been removed, the only mention I saw is that they don't work at the default security level:

> * The security strength of SHA1 and MD5 based signatures in TLS has been reduced.
> 
> This results in SSL 3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1 and DTLS 1.0 no longer working at the default security level of 1 and instead requires security level 0. The security level can be changed either using the cipher string with @SECLEVEL, or calling SSL_CTX_set_security_level(3). This also means that where the signature algorithms extension is missing from a ClientHello then the handshake will fail in TLS 1.2 at security level 1. This is because, although this extension is optional, failing to provide one means that OpenSSL will fallback to a default set of signature algorithms. This default set requires the availability of SHA1.

I think we need to discuss with PM (CC'd Ian) about what TLS levels we do and don't want to support in Morpheus.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I've already sent a PM to Ian to remove support for TLS 1 and 1.1 in our product.

According to the "unofficial" https://endoflife.software/protocols/encryption/tls those protocols was EOLd close to 4 years ago, and TLS 1.2 dates back to 2008 which is more than 14 years ago. I doubt that we have any _supported_ SDKs out there which doesn't support TLS 1.2. It seems really odd to me if customers think that: "Yes I do want TLS, but I don't want to upgrade to a system which supports TLS 1.2. I want to stick to something with a bunch of security related problems".

Looking at https://www.ssllabs.com/ssl-pulse/ the tooltip for the protocol support also states: "You must not use SSL v2.0 and SSL v3.0, because it is insecure. Avoid the usage of TLS v1.0 and TLS v1.1."

It seems odd to me to invest in adding support for FIPS and securing the problem and still let customers who don't know any better still be able to leave the support for TLS 1 and 1.1 in there.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I have no problem with removing them (assuming that's in line with PM's requirements) and hence disabling the tests - but we should be doing so with some thought and not "because Ubuntu 20.04 has disabled them by default".

Arguably if we are not supporting TLS 1.0 and 1.1 we should do that explicitly - remove all support for it, and update the tests to expect negotiation to fail.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Note: this did not mark the bug on getting off OpenSSL 1.1.1 as done (it just made the system _skip_ a few tests _if_ we're running on OpenSSL 3.0).. The intention was to just make the transition easier to avoid having to deal with synchronizing patch to upgrade OpenSSL _AND_ kv-engine at the same time. First get OpenSSL 3.0 in; then clean up the rest of the code in memcached.

as part of OpenSSL 3 they've introduced the concept of providers which needs to be loaded; and "fips" is one of them. Its a lot easier to do all of that work once the server is building with OpenSSL 3.0 than having to synchronize two different builds..

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Sure. So to clarify - I don't have a problem with the patch itself here - I just think we should make the commit message accurately reflect our rationale for disabling these tests - e.g. "We are no longer supporting TLS 1.0 & 1.1 with OpenSSL 3.0, disable them as part of initial migration."
