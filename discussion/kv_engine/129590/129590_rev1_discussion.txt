DESCRIPTION:

MB-39456: Refactor GetKeys code in ep_engine.cc to getkeys.(h/cc)

Refactor code for GetKeys in ep_engine.cc by moving it to getkeys.(h/cc)
so that we can access AllKeysCallback within kvstore implementations.
Which will be needed when GetKeys is updated to support collections.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> So this raises a question along the lines of what I mentioned yesterday - why does *KVStore need to know about the details of AllKeysCallback? 

At the KVStore interface level, can't we keep something similar to what was there before - an abstract callback taking a DiskDocKey - say StatusCallback ?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> I've refactored AllKeysCallback to be a StatusCallback, so this commit message is no longer true. However, I still feel this refactor has some benefits in helping to better separating out the getallkeys task and callback away from the ep_engine code. Any thoughts on keeping this refactor and me updating the commit message?

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> That's fine if you want to keep the split into individual files - just update the commit message to reflect the updated rationale.
