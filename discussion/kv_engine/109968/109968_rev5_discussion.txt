Line:265, engines/ep/tests/CMakeLists.txt -> I think it's simpler to just have one component handle the timeout - certainly in CV machines we attempt to timeout 1s before the CTest timeout it's possible someone is slow and it doesn't work as expected.

Suggest you use `timeout` to handle the timeout (and raise ABRT) if available, and if not _then_ set the CTest timeout property (lines 280..283 etc

Line:265, engines/ep/tests/CMakeLists.txt -> Had a try at doing as you suggested, but the TIMEOUT property defaults to 1500 which might be lower than the value that we set it to (and the value that we pass time 'timeout'). So, I simplified it a little bit and added a comment to explain.
