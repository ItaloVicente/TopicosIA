DESCRIPTION:

Remove cached version of num_writer_threads for magma

The cached value of the number of threads was only used for logging.
Given that it also used a cached version of the number of threads
from ep-engine (the real number exists in the ExecutorPool and
is tuned through memcached.json) we should remove the (unused)
cached number.
