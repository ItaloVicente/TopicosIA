DESCRIPTION:

Refactor [SR]: Use Item::getCommitted only when strictly necessary

The main motivation behind this change is that the Item::getCommitted
function requires (*this) being an operation that can be translated to a
StoredValue's CommittedState.

But, a queue_op::abort_sync_write doesn't translate to any
CommittedState.
Given that Item::getCommitted is (indirectly) called by
ActiveStream::makeResponseFromItem when we build a DcpResponse to
stream, we need to avoid that call in that code path for making DCP_ABORT
messages.

With this patch I'm actually limiting the use of Item::getCommitted to
when it is strictly necessary, i.e. to when we set the CommittedState for
StoredValue from Item::op. That is to avoid any further similar issue.

Line:280, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> I believe this is a pessimiation. As per ep_bucket::canDeDuplicate(), we can de-dupelicate an existing queue_op::mutation  with a queue_op::pending_sync_write.

Line:280, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> My approach here is to keep the same logic, the purpose of this patch is to remove the call to Item::getCommitted().

So, maybe we want to aligned in-memory/on-disk deduplication, but in terms of before/after this is equivalent (no pessimization), given that:

(CommittedState != CommittedViaMutation) === (isDurabilityOp())

and we enforce that (even before) for both the 'existing' and 'new' item.

Line:280, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> I mean it's a pessimization compared to how we de-dupe when we flush.
