DESCRIPTION:

Fix Clang Static Analyzer warnings related to SingleThreadedRCPtr<>

Fix clang warning now being generated due to an upgrade form
scan-build-6.0 to scan-build-9. The warnings fixed in this patch are all
related to SingleThreadedRCPtr<>. To do this inline the ref counting so
that the analyzer can and understand the what the state of RCValue is.
Also in some cases we need to use std::move() rather than a copy of
SingleThreadedRCPtr<> to convince clang analyzer that the underlying
object will remain referenced and will not be freed after it as already
been. Plus clean up a few clang-tidy warnings.
