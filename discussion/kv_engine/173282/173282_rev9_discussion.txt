DESCRIPTION:

MB-51715: Timeout SeqnoPersistenceRequests when no data is flushed

Prior to this change, a SeqnoPersistenceRequest would wait 'forever'
if no data is moving through the vbucket and never timeout. This is
because execution into the code managing the SeqnoPersistenceRequests
only occurs from a successful flush of an item.

This is addressed in this commit by the addition of a new task which
will run when there are SeqnoPersistenceRequests to expire. This new
task runs for persistent and ephemeral (replacing
EphemeralBucket::NotifyHighPriorityReqTask) and aims to only run when
notifications might need expiring.

The configuration is updated so that 0 is a legal value for
"seqno_persistence_timeout", enabling tests with minimal real run-time.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> General approach looks good. Few specific comments below - testing as per your comment also probably wants expanding (esp around concurrency...)
Line:29, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_bucket.h -> Note we probably don't want the compiler to generate a dtor every time we include this header - suggest leaving the declaration here and just changing the definition in the .cc file to be `... = default;`.

Line:3066, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> Exposing the wakeTime in the general case is pretty racy (it can obviously change between calls in a full multi-threaded setup). 

Perhaps make this protected so only allow a test helper / introspection class can access it - to avoid anyone accidentally trying to read it (and do something with it) from production code?

Line:921, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> "expiry" is possibly a little ambiguous given our normal use of the term. Perhaps re-phrase to "request timeout" or similar?

Line:1188, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> and ... ?

Line:51, engines/ep/src/seqno_persistence_notify_task.cc -> "... and the re-snoozing of the task"? (if we dropped the lock before snoozeAndWait() then two different threads could end up updating wakeTime correctly but the "wrong" thread ends up calling snoozeAndWait first)

Line:61, engines/ep/src/seqno_persistence_notify_task.cc -> Might be worth highlighting that snoozeAndWait (as opposed to plain snooze()) is required here to avoid lost wakeup.

Line:69, engines/ep/src/seqno_persistence_notify_task.cc -> Nit: Do we need this? If empty wouldn't iterations be set to 0 and hence for() loop is never entered?

Line:93, engines/ep/src/seqno_persistence_notify_task.cc -> Note that the first vBucket which still has a deadline will cause the check at line 57 to be true (given snooze() at line 67 sets wakeTime to INT_MAX). As such, you'll call snoozeAndWait _inside_ the running task which is somewhat inefficient as you'll be blocking this (NonIO?) thread while the main scheduler thread processes the task update time.

I think what you would ideally do is track the new sleepTime value to use for this task (initially set to INT_MAX, tracking minimum as new deadlines found), then just call setWakeTime once at the end of this function - and then let the ExecutorPool reschedule once without serialising threads when run() returns.

Line:36, engines/ep/src/seqno_persistence_notify_task.h -> I expect this will need some further calibration.

Line:110, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Given these are all public members, can we make any / all of them const if they cannot be changed after construction?

Line:110, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Please document timeout?

Line:115, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Do we need order here? If not unordered_map is cheaper.

Line:613, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Perhaps document what happens if the timeout is exceeded?

Line:653, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Please document this method.

Line:61, engines/ep/src/seqno_persistence_notify_task.cc -> You might still have problems with using the non-waiting Snooze(); as the actual task isn't guaranteed to be rescheduled before this function returns, so if/when a other thread decides to update the sleep time you could end up updating snooze() out of order...

Line:61, engines/ep/src/seqno_persistence_notify_task.cc -> I've changed this to snooze - I don't think there's a difference for this case - my original confusion was that calling task->snooze has no affect on making a sleeping task run, ExecutorPool::snooze works
