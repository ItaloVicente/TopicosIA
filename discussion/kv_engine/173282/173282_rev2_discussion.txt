DESCRIPTION:

MB-51715: Timeout seqno persistence requests when no data is flushed

Prior to this change, a seqno persistence request would wait 'forever'
if no data is moving through the vbucket.

This commit makes to primary changes that fix the new test.

1) Poke the flusher from the addition of a seqno persistence request
2) Callback to the vbucket to check for timed out requests from the
   no-data case of the flusher.

The configuration is updated so that 0 is a legal wait time, enabling
the test with minimal run-time.

One limitation of this code is that for the duration of the pending
request (and no mutations), the flusher is in a run/sleep(0)/run
cycle which could be improved to be run/sleep(n)/run, where n could
be something like 1 second, yielding similar results with much less
CPU used.
