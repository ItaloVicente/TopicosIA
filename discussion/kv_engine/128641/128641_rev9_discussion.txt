DESCRIPTION:

MB-39505: Split server_stats into global, aggregated and bucket specific stats

Will be useful when Prometheus needs to expose these stats so that:
 - global stats need only be collected once
 - per-bucket stat collected for each bucket and labelled
 - aggregated stats not exposed, as per the spec
