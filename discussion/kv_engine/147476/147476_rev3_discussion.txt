DESCRIPTION:

MB-37520: Don't use AtomicSharedPtr for DcpProducer::backfillMgr

DcpProducer::backfillMgr is implemented using
cb::AtomicSharedPtr. Accessing the BackfillManager via this pointer is
costly; it requires a mutex is acquired/released, and the creation of
a std::shared_ptr object (and associated refcount
increment/decrement).

Profiling a Dcp backfill workload where the items are 100% resident
(disk is only used for seqno index) shows ~15% of the overall time in
BackfillManagerTask::run is spent in
DcpProducer::recordBackfillManagerBytesRead().

DcpProducer::backfillMgr was changed to cb::AtomicSharedPtr (from
std::shared_ptr) to address a data race between two reset() paths -
during bucket deletion by background bucket deletion thread (via
closeAllStreams), and EventuallyPersistentEngine::handleDisconnect() -
see fa8692d72c44 ("MB-32084: Fix data race in
'test_mb20751_deadlock_on_disconnect_delete'").

However, it turns out that a later patch 715d4c32c563 ("MB-38521:
Don't allow concurrent execution of Producer closeAllStreams") which
was a slightly different race addressed the underlying issue
independantly; by adding locking around the reset() of the (atomic)
shared ptr.

As such, the AtomicSharedPtr is no longer necessary and can be changed
to the much cheaper std::shared_ptr.
