DESCRIPTION:

MB-39422: WIP: Simplify memoryCondition()

As observed when testing data load / rebalance workloads under high
DGM, when KV-Engine hits the high watermark, a large amount of work is
done on the front-end thread.

Specifically, we see that 60% of each active front-end thread is spent
inside memoryCondition(), which just decides if memory recovery should
be attempted or not (it doesn't actually recover any memory).

There looks to be a range of problems here:

1. Excessive time spent in VBucketCountVisitor::visitBucket. 98% of
   all time in memoryCondition is spent in
   VBucketCountVisitor::visitBucket. This is called to calculate the
   number of resident items, and if non-zero them the ItemPager is
   woken up. However VBucketCountVisitor::visitBucket actually
   accumulates ~50 or so stats, many of which are more expensive than
   the item counts, and so there's ~48 stats which are calculated and
   them simply ignored.

2. Excessive calls to memoryCondition(). Every time a client operation
   fails due to not enough memory being available (i.e. at/above high
   watermark), memoryCondition is called, and perform the above
   expensive checks.
   This is very wasteful because:

   a) The ItemPager could already be running, and it cannot be
      re-scheduled again until it's finished anyway.

   b) Another client thread could already be running memoryCondition,
      so threads are repeating the same work.

3. memoryCondition is arguably over-complex in what it's trying to do.

   a) It's essentially doing two things at the same time - determine
      if we should return ETMPFAIL or NOMEM to the user, and secondly
      attempt to recover memory if possible.

   b) The memory recovery logic is complex / brittle - we attempt to
      predict if memory could be recovered ahead of time, with two
      possible approaches - paging out items, or closing unreferenced
      Checkpoints. However, I suspect the prediction isn't always
      correct in deterring if any more memory can be freed, as it
      relies on indirect metrics like number of items resident), which
      could already be zero, and memory is in use elsewhere.

Attempt to address all the above issues by simplifying what
memoryCondition does - replace the decision on when to wake the
ItemPager with a much simpler, cheaper, direct policy - base the
memory freeing policy on memory watermarks:

- If bucket mem_used between mutation_mem_threshold and bucket_quota
  (i.e. 93% and 100% of bucket) then attempt to wake ItemPager and
  return ETMPFAIL

- If bucket mem_used over bucket_quota then attempt to wake ItemPager
  and return ENOMEM.

The rationale here is that to get to mutation_mem_threshold (93% of
memory bucket quota) then the bucket must already be under some duress
- either a rapid burst of mutations taking memory significantly over
the high watermark (85%), or one or more slow Checkpoint Cursors
(Flusher, DCP) causing memory usage to be very high. Either way, we
should attempt to trigger all memory freeing tasks to bring usage
down.
