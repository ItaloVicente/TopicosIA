DESCRIPTION:

MB-53584: Reset throttled cookies during Bucket delete

Currently we hang if we delete a Bucket when we have throttled cookies
in the system. This is because we set cookies ewouldblock state to true
when we throttle them so we must wait for them when disconnecting
connections and we stop ticking the throttle gauge then a Bucket is not
in the ready state so no notification is made to progress the
cookie/connection.

Reset the throttled cookies as we wait for clients to disconnect to
avoid processing them and avoid the Bucket deletion getting stuck.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> If you just nuke that extra if I'll upgrade it to a +2 :) 
Line:255, daemon/buckets.cc -> The only way we can have a connection in throttledConnections is that it did select the bucket _AND_ it has a command which is throttled. As long as a command is throttled it _CANNOT_ switch bucket so this will _ALWAYS_ be true.
