DESCRIPTION:

MB-50984: Rename Checkpoint::MemoryCounter::parentUsage into cmUsage

In the recent work for MB-51681 we have removed the need for
MemoryCounter to track the memory usage of parents different than CM.
This patch:
 1. Makes that explicit in the class members and comments
 2. Enforces tighter expectations on the MemoryCounter state
 3. Removes dead code (eg, the custom MemoryCounter dtor)
