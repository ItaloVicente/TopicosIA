DESCRIPTION:

MB-28629: Improve logging when failing to set up server socket

Previously we did not print out which port we failed to configure
during startup. Instead the log looked like:

    INFO Enable management port(s)
    INFO Enable user port(s)
    CRITICAL Failed to create listening socket

This patch extends this to:

    INFO Enable management port(s)
    INFO Enable user port(s)
    CRITICAL Failed to create IPv4 port for "*":11210
    CRITICAL Failed to create IPv6 port for "*":11210
    CRITICAL Failed to create listening socket

This gives deeper insight in why we failed to start. It is
still considered a fatal error if we fail to create all ports
specified by ns_server as we don't really have a way to tell
ns_server which port we failed to set up (and it can't tell
us to try again).
