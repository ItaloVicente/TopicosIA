DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Make MockCookie to more like Cookie my making it a class

This patch aims to remove the C style implementation of MockCookie. By
making functions related to MockCookie, methods of MockCookie. Also some
refactoring of the types and function names has been done so that we can
make pure virtual defs of them in CookieIface so they match the
implementation of Cookie.

This patch also ensures that they're are no public members instead
opting for (get/set)ers. Thus resulting in some changes to tests.

The removal of create_mock_cookie()/destroy_mock_cookie() and
cookie_to_mock_cookie() has not be done in this patch as its beyond this
patches scope due to them being widely used thought our code base.
