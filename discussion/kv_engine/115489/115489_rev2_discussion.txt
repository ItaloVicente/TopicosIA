DESCRIPTION:

MB-35889: Tune the dcp cursor dropping tests

The tests were still occasionally failing following changes made in
581e5750, running with logging shows after the write phase has finished,
mem_used drops very close to the cursor dropping thresholds (drop of
mem_used is attributed to the change which clears checkpoint key-indexes
on close)

In a successful run we were seeing the following logging, showing that
3MB mem_used comparing with a 3MB trigger (logging is rounded). It 
wouldn't take much more deallocation to trigger a failure of the test.

2019-09-27T13:59:09.607791+01:00 INFO (default) Triggering memory recovery as mem_used (3 MB) exceeds cursor_dropping_upper_mark (65%, 3 MB). Attempting to free 0 MB of memory.
2019-09-27T13:59:09.607880+01:00 INFO 57005: (default) DCP (Producer) eq_dcpq:unittest - (vb:0) Handling slow stream; state_ : in-memory, lastReadSeqno : 25, lastSentSeqno : 20, vBucketHighSeqno : 6425, isBackfillTaskRunning : False

Tweaking the upper threshold and we see 3MB used and a 2MB trigger, a
more reliable comparison!
