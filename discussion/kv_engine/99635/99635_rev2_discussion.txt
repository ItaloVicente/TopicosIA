DESCRIPTION:

MB-30552: Remove implicit constructor of Vbid from uint16_t

This patch changes the constructor of Vbid to be explicit as
well as the operator which allowed implicit conversion to uint16_t
as previous uses of the implicit constructor have now been
completely factored out. Comparison operators have also been made
const to cover usages now that implicit conversion is gone.
Finally, this change adds in some last minute fixes that were
edited during the final stages of adding this change-set.

Line:118, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> Given we have the get() method to return the underlying raw value, do we really need this now?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:118, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> Done, builds and tests fine without it so assumedly not currently used, and get can be used instead.
