DESCRIPTION:

Invoke gdb on the minidump files from testapp crashes

Now that we use breakpad for the memcached process controlled
by memcached_testapp we can also look at the callstack if a
minidump gets created as part of the test run.

The "gtest environment" was cleaned up with an "atexit()" handler
so there is a limited set of what we may do at that time. Given
that we don't really need anything special from the environment
we can might as well just use a normal object we control the
life time.
