DESCRIPTION:

MB-35071: Use a single worker thread in bucket test to avoid races

The test used multiple connections to the server, and the setup to
cause the operation to block was two commands. We could therefore
end up that the server would run the first command and not the
second before deleting the bucket. Given that the second command
wasn't executed yet (the one which would put the connection in
blocked state) the server would delete the bucket immediately
and the second command would be discarded (and connection deleted).

During cleanup of EWB it would now stop the threads and that would
cause the connection to be signalled (but the connection isn't valid
anymore because it never entered the ewb state).
