DESCRIPTION:

MB-34262: Replicate ephemeral tombstone times

1) Ephemeral backfill wasn't copying the tombstone time from
the OSV deleted time field into the outgoing Item, DCP
delete v2 sent either 0 or the expiry time to the client. 

This is corrected in the memory backfill so that the time is now
passed to the Item that DCP will use to build the outbound
message.

2) The ephemeral DCP consumer path wasn't doing the reverse of 1 (same 
for DelWithMeta). That is when the replicated delete is pushed into the
HT/seqno linked list, we didn't copy through any delete time, a new 
delete time was always being generated.
