DESCRIPTION:

MB-29265: Initialize frequencyCounterSaturated

The frequencyCounterSaturated member was not initialized in
the constructor of the class, but set through a member function.

We did not check if the function was set before trying to call
it, and std::function throws an exception if none is set. To
avoid adding a check we'll initialize it to an empty
function as part of the object constructor.

I tried it again today and I was not able to reproduce the issue... I believe that I messed up my testing yesterday and used the wrong version of memcached (being copied between 4-5 machines)... I've spent 3 hours today trying to reproduce the crash I saw yesterday without success (yesterday I had it reproduced within 10-15 minutes _every_ time)...
