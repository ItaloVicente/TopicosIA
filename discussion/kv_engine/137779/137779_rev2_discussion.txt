Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

In the MB's backtrace, is the problem not that EventuallyPersistentEngine::initialize() is changing environment _after_ it's already been written? (and after someone else has previously read it)?

i.e. if Environment is conceptually a singleton, it should only be written to once...

It should be a singleton. I originally wrote it to only write once but I didn't want to rely on memcached/test harness only creating 1 bucket at a time (allowing simultaneous creations would still have a similar race) so I made it atomic instead as it will eventually need to be anyway when we allow for dynamic file descriptor limit changes. I could also add a compare exchange so that we will only set it once from EventuallyPersistentEngine::initialize()?

If the value is planned to by dynamic then std::atomic seems reasonable. 

re: the singleton, looking at the code again it feels like Environment is something which should just be part of the server API - it's values all are populated from the server. 

Having it as an object / interface on the server would be nicer than a Singleton and would avoid these kinds of ordering issues. Can you recall any reason we didn't do it that way?

I can't recall anything specific. Perhaps just that we need to do some calculations to work out how many file descriptors each storage backend should get and that doesn't feel like something that belongs in memcached

I think the boundaries between memcached and ep-engine are slowly changing, esp given memcache bucket is going away and hence the only engine is ep.

However, looking at the code we have similar functionality in create_ep_engine_instance() - for example the BucketLogger has the loggerAPI set there (conceptually a singleton), same with initialize_time_functions. 

For how what we have is probably fine, but if we need to make the config dynamic (and hence cannot blindly set it in EVP::initialize(), I'd suggest adding a `static Environment::create(ServerApi*)` function there which does the necessary singleton creation and setting of FD limit.

Sounds good. Will link this in MB-39302 (dynamic fd limit) for later
