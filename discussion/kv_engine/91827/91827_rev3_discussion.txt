DESCRIPTION:

MB-28967: Move configuration code into own static library

The ep-engine configuration code - which includes code generated as
build time - is needed by CouchRocks. As such, to be able to express a
dependancy between CouchRocks and the config code, move the ep-engine
configuration code into a static library.
