DESCRIPTION:

MB-37772: Refactor ScanContext so it owns the database handle

This patch aligns Rocks/Couch KVStore with Magma, in that
instead of the ScanContext holding a 'scan-id' which is used
to lookup the 'handle' required for the scan(), we embed the
abstract KVFileHandle into ScanContext. Now ScanContext owns
the handle which will be useful for allowing backfill code to
further interrogate the KVStore (e.g. call getCollectionStats).

Note that the abstract KVHandle is a unique_ptr with a custom
delete function, so deleting the ScanContext will trigger
a callback into KVStore to close the handle.

Change-Id: I708d663bfa44b8b93cdf9a88fd05e73f63517d00

Line:1484, engines/ep/src/rocksdb-kvstore/rocksdb-kvstore.cc -> wasn't 100% sure about this, we hold the lock for the enture scan? so no other thread can start one?

The todo suggests it is just for safe access to the map, so removal on that basis seems ok
