DESCRIPTION:

MB-47551: Avoid putting cursor in closed CP if we don't have to

In the case where the checkpoint manager has no data (due to expel),
registerCursorBySeqno was placing the cursor in the closed CP. If
no data was flowing this would keep the closed checkpoint for
as long as the vbucket was quiesced.

The fix here is to avoid closed checkpoints under these conditions
and favour the open checkpoint.

A few cases are covered by testing.

1) Where a checkpoint has been fully cleared by expel
2) Where expel has cleared some of the closed cp
3) Where expel has not executed at all

So I set a -1 because there seems to be issues in the new logic. See comment in code.

But apart from that, the change is touching a risky area and not sure if that's worth doing.
Even if a cursor is placed in a closed/empty checkpoint, at the very first move it will jump into the open checkpoint, so closed checkpoints are expected to become unreferenced again quite quickly.
Line:275, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> This shouldn't be possible.. I think that we should Expects(st <= en) always here

It is worth doing imho as it happened in a CBSE, hence why I created this. The user had idle buckets and we were pointlessly keeping closed checkpoints referenced. I understand your concern, but no part of the code should be untouchable because we fear it is risky.

Line:275, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> It happens, certainly in cheshire-cat, I'll check it against master. 

Note that one of the unit test in this patch triggers this condition (CheckpointTest.MB_47516)

Line:275, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> See the code in Checkpoint::getHighSeqno

There is a condition where it returns and subtracts 1, that is the case that allows start to exceed end
