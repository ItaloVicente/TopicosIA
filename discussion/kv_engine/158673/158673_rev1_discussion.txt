DESCRIPTION:

MB-47551: Avoid putting cursor in closed CP if we don't have to

In the case where the checkpoint manager has no data (due to expel),
registerCursorBySeqno was placing the cursor in the closed CP. If
no data was flowing this would keep the closed checkpoint for
as long as the vbucket was quiesced.

The fix here is to avoid closed checkpoints under these conditions
and favour the open checkpoint.

A few cases are covered by testing.

1) Where a checkpoint has been fully cleared by expel
2) Where expel has cleared some of the closed cp
3) Where expel has not executed at all
