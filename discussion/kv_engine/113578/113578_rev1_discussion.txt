DESCRIPTION:

MB-35612: replace needs to check for pending operation

The replace path was missing a check for the key having a pending
operation.

In the bug report in the case of a sync-delete in progress replace
views the StoredValue as deleted and incorrectly returns KEY_ENOENT.

Line:562, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> I believe we should also check this for Ephemeral buckets - suggest moving to DurabilityBucketTest fixture.
