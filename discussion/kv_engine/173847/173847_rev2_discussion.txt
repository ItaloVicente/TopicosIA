DESCRIPTION:

MB-51689: Use SnapshotMarker HPS for Disk snapshots

Currently we set the HPS at the end of Disk snapshots to the
snapshot end to avoid de-dupe from not moving the HPS. That's
generally fine, but does allow for  replica to be rebuilt with
higher HPS than is strictly necessary. Consider a two replica
scenario:

A:  [1:Pre, 2:Commit] HPS = 1
R1: [1:Pre, 2:Commit] HPS = 1 (Built from memory)
R2: [1:Pre, 2:Commit] HPS = 2 (Build from disk)

Were R2 to get behind and the active to perform non-durable
writes we could have the following:

A:  [1:Pre, 2:Commit] ... [1000:Mutation] HPS = 1
R1: [1:Pre, 2:Commit] ... [1000:Mutation] HPS = 1
R2: [1:Pre, 2:Commit] HPS = 2

If the active node were to failover in such a scenario then we
would promote R2 due to the higher HPS value. This would cause us
to roll back all seqnos from 3 to 1000. Whilst we only guarantee
that we do not lose committed durable writes, and normal mutations
do not have such guarantees, we can still do better. The active
node knows when it sends the Disk snapshot to R2 that the HPS
value for the snapshot is 1. We can instead send this HPS value
via SnapshotMarker (similar to the HCS/PCS value already sent) and
use it on the replica instead of the snapshot end. This would
allow for R1 to be promoted in the above case as the two nodes
would have HPS = 1 and the high seqno would be used as a tie breaker.

Whilst this logic can be performed on replica vBuckets when the
producer vBucket for this connection is the same version, we still
must deal with the case in which the producer is a 6.5 - 7.1 node.
These older producers will not send the HPS in the SnapshotMarkers
so we must maintain the current behaviour in that scenario as we
lack a more appropriate HPS value.

TODO: Binary/DCP protocol changes to send the new packet versions.
TODO: Use SnapshotMarker HPS for Memory snapshots in which
      we do not receive prepares (partial snapshots)
