DESCRIPTION:

MB-37944: cb::const_char_buffer -> std::string_view migration prep

In preparation for replacing all uses of cb::const_char_buffer with
std::string_view, change various uses of cb::const_char_buffer to
match the std::string API :-

* Use data() and size() member functions instead of .buf and .len
  (which std::string doesn't expose).

* Use explicit conversion from cb::char_buffer to
  cb::const_char_buffer (std::string_view has no such implicit
  conversion).

Change-Id: If74f2a2943541d81b00d505ca19f6c420f22f11c
