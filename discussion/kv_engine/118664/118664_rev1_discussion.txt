DESCRIPTION:

MB-36948: Pass maxVisibleSeqno to ActiveStream::markDiskSnapshot

Interface only change that allows backfill (disk/memory) code to set
a maxVisibleSeqno.

In this commit, we pass a value of the endSeqno and push that into
the readyQueue (SnapshotMarker), that is the end of the journey
because DcpProducer will not push the value any further.
