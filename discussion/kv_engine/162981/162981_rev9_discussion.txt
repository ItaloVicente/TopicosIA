DESCRIPTION:

MB-48680: Add optional key->vb sanity check to mutation and delete

Add an optional (off by default) sanity check mode to check that a
key maps to the provided vBucket. This can be turned on by setting
vbucket_mapping_sanity_checking to true via epctl. An additional
configuration variable was also added to change the error mode of
these sanity checks. Changing
vbucket_mapping_sanity_checking_error_mode to log, throw, or abort
changes the error mode respectively. This allows us to reuse this
(should we ever need to) in customer environments where we may want
to log or throw an exception rather than abort the process (which
is preferrable in a QE environment).

Line:1519, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I suggest we make the default the least disruptive (i.e. log); in case a customer turns vbucket_mapping_sanity_checking on without changing the error_mode. (For QE if they are changing one config param they can just as easily change 2).

Line:29, engines/ep/src/dockey_validator.cc -> Might be useful to include some context on where the mismatch was found - i.e. add an extra string_view argument which the caller can pass to specify where the check is occurring.

Line:306, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_engine_test.cc -> Should probably also add a positive test (check that the correct vbid is accepted).
