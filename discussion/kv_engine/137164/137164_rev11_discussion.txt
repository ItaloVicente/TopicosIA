DESCRIPTION:

MB-39292: 4/n Allow force in Collections::Manifest

A force manifest bypasses the "is successor" checks allowing for
collections to change in anyway, e.g. move a scope.

Note that 'unusual' changes don't yet have any affect with
this commit, we just allow the manifest to become current.
