Line:227, engines/ep/src/defragmenter.cc -> strictly speaking `unsigned` does not have to be 32bits in size (see https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/types) - it depends on the Data Model used.

Looking at when this code was introduced, the casting to uint64_t was needed because we were (incorrectly) passing a size_ to getProperty(), and we needed a type which was printable via snprintf() on Windows.

Given we are now using the correct type of unsigned, I think you can avoid the cast entirely:

 snprintf(buf, sizeof(buf), "arenas.bin.%u.size", nbins - 1);
