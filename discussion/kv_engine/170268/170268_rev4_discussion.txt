DESCRIPTION:

MB-50874: Reset snap start if less than lastSeqno on new checkpoint creation

+Problem+

If a replica vBucket is promoted to active, and the last DCP message
it received was a Snapshot Marker which had the first mutation
de-duplicated, then the snapshot start of the newly-promoted active
ends up greater than the active.

Upon the next Flusher run (i.e. next mutation to the vBucket), the
Flusher throws an exception when trying to fetch items which
terminates KV-Engine (as exception is thrown on BG thread):

    CheckpointManager::queueDirty: lastBySeqno not in snapshot range. vb:0 state:active snapshotStart:12 lastBySeqno:11 snapshotEnd:11 genSeqno:Yes checkpointList.size():2

+Details+

When streaming data from an Active to Replica vBucket, the extent of
the Checkpoint is sent via DCP using a SnapshotMarker message,
followed by N Mutation / Deletion messages. The snapshot marker may be
discontinuous compared to the previous if any de-duplication occurred
within the Checkpoint - for example if document "key" was written
sufficient times in quick succession, one could end up with the
following two Checkpoints on the active and subsequent DCP
SnapshotMarker sent to the replica:

    CheckpointManager[0x108a03080] with numItems:6 checkpoints:2
        Checkpoint[0x10891f000] with id:2 seqno:{1,10} snap:{0,10, visible:10} state:CHECKPOINT_CLOSED numCursors:1 type:Memory hcs:-- items:[
            {10,mutation,cid:0x0: deduplicated_key,119,}
            {11,checkpoint_end,cid:0x1:checkpoint_end,119,[m]}
        ]
        Checkpoint[0x10891fa00] with id:3 seqno:{11,12} snap:{10,12, visible:12} state:CHECKPOINT_OPEN numCursors:1 type:Memory hcs:-- items:[
            {11,checkpoint_start,cid:0x1:checkpoint_start,121,[m]}
            {12,mutation,cid:0x0:deduplicated_key,130,}
        ]

Note how there are just two mutations remaining (at seqnos 10 and 12),
and that there is a seqno "gap" at 11 (ignore meta-items which are not
send over DCP).

When this is replicated over DCP it will be sent as:

* DCP_SNAPSHOT_MARKER(start:0, end:10, flags=CHK)
* DCP_MUTATION(seqno:10, ...)
* DCP_SNAPSHOT_MARKER(start:12, end:12, flags=CHK)
* DCP_MUTATION(seqno:12, ...)

Note that the second SnapshotMarker being flagged as "CHK"
(Checkpoint) is essential - we need the replica to end up creating a
new Checkpoint with the start and end controlled by the active - a
SnapshotMarker without that flag is insufficient as it just extends
the existing checkpoint, increasing the checkpoint end but leaving
start unaffected.

Once these messages are replicated over DCP the replica vBucket should
have equivalent state as the active.

However; if the last DCP_MUTATION is not received - for example if the
active node is being failed over and the stream is closed before the
DCP_MUTATION, then the state of the replica - crucially the Open
checkpoint is as follows:

    Checkpoint[0x10cecde00] with id:2 seqno:{11,11} snap:{12,12, visible:12} state:CHECKPOINT_OPEN numCursors:0 type:Memory hcs:-- items:[
	{11,checkpoint_start,cid:0x1:checkpoint_start,121,[m]}
    ]

When this sequence occurs, the seqno range (11,11) in the open
Checkpoint is less than the snapshot range (12,12). This is
problematic as we have essentially broken an invariant on Checkpoints
- that all items within them are between the snapshot start and end.

This doesn't immediately cause a problem, but if this vBucket is
converted to Active and starts accepting mutations itself, it will
start generating seqnos from the last seqno received - 10 in this
case. This results in the next mutation being assigned seqno 11, which
when the flusher is woken and attempts to flush throws an exception on
the BG thread and crashes KV-Engine.

+Solution+

The cleanest way to solve this would be to ensure that the
SnapshotMarker has a start equal to the start of the source Checkpoint
- i.e. 11 instead of 12. That is indeed what has been done to address
MB-50333 which is a SyncWrite variant of this issue. However that is a
medium-sized change and affects the actual data sent over the wire, so
more risky for a maitenance fix.

Instead this patch takes a more targetted approach - when we create a
new Checkpoint during the setvBucketState, we modify the start seqno
if it is less than the lastSeqno.
