DESCRIPTION:

MB-52682: Derive initial MFU of new values from MFU histograms

Historically, all new items start with a frequency counter of 4. As the
MFU of existing items may have increased through accesses (e.g.,
everything could be >100), new items would be more likely to be
evicted straight away, before potential accesses are able to increase
the frequency counter.

To counter this, "young" items (age determined from the HLC cas) were
made ineligible (config params item_eviction_age_percentage,
item_eviction_freq_counter_age_threshold).

Each vbucket currently tracks a histogram of the frequency counter of
all stored values which are eligible for eviction.

This patch uses these histograms select an appropriate starting
frequency counter, prepping new items to be at some configured
percentile of MFU values.

This is a step towards frequency counters being comparable across
vbuckets.

This patch does _not_ address the frequency counter of items bgfetched
from disk; currently they will have their freq counter set to the
initial freq count (Item::initialFreqCount, currently 4).

A consequence of that is that bgfetched items will start at a very low
MFU value, leading to sub-optimal eviction. This will be addressed in a
following patch, by setting them to the initial counter value discussed
above.
