DESCRIPTION:

MB-53657: Notify DCP frontend at CM::queueSetVBState()

Existing DCP stream aren't notified of new set_vbucket_state items
queued in checkpoints.

The consequence is that in checkpoints like [e cs m vbs vbs) DCP
cursor might not reach the end of the checkpoint, thus leaving DCP
item remaining stats > 0.

Issue introduced in the recent changes where we started accounting
also checkpoint meta-items in the counters for DCP cursors.
