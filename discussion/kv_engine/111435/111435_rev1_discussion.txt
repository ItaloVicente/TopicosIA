DESCRIPTION:

MB-34789: Send mutation instead of commit for backfilled commits

Send a DCP Mutation instead of a DCP Commit when sending a commit
with prepare seqno > requested stream start seqno if the commit
has been backfilled from disk. We need to do this because the
de-duplication of keys on disk can result in a commit being the
first seqno a replica will see. In this case we must send a mutation
because the consumer needs to know what to commit. Currently, the
code does this if the prepare seqno is less than the requested
start seqno. This does not solve the case where we de-dupe a prepare
within the disk snapshot though. Instead, send the mutation instead
of the commit if the replica did not receive the prepare before it
connected whilst we are backfilling from disk.

Also would be useful to include that example from the whiteboard in the commit message as a motivating example for why we need to do this.
Line:319, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Probably worth a brief comment here as to why we are calling with new argument set to Yes.

Line:219, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> Please document this argument in the method description.

Line:48, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> I feel here that enum values other than yes/no would be clearer here - e.g.

 enum class SendCommitSyncWriteAs {
    Commit,
    Mutation
 }

IMHO that makes the code more self-documenting (we're highlighting this is a SyncWrite thing).

Please also document the enum type and values

Line:70, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.cc -> Style: If we don't need to modify the queued_item (RCPtr) then prefer just passing the underlying object type - i.e. `const Item&`

Updated commit message
Line:319, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Done

Line:219, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.h -> Done

Line:48, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> Done

Line:70, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.cc -> The DcpResponse stores a queued_item (we std::move the one that we pass in). I just wanted to make this function signature the same as the private one it exposes given I was already updating it

Line:70, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.cc -> Sure. Updating makeResponseFromItem and the constructors of the DcpResponse classes to take an r-value is tangential from this patch so I'll just leave this as it is for now.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:70, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.cc -> If we are consuming the item passed in then it should be an rvalue-reference. See the smart pointer rules under http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#S-resource (RCPtr is semantically a shared_ptr<>).
