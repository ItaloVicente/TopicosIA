Would like to get ns_server confirmation that we can definitely nuke this.

Note: the environment variable to use this is _ONLY_ present in MH. It was initially added as a temporary solution as we stored the CRAM-MD5 hash of the password in there. We no longer support CRAM-MD5 so the file don't contain that.

Patch Set 4:

Confirmation from the ns_server side that support for this capability and the COUCHBASE_CBSASL_SECRETS env var has been removed from the code - and quite a long time ago actually. (It was removed from the code when we moved to only storing salted hashes in isasl.pw.)
