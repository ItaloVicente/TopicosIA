DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: Add current range scan time to range-scan stats

As RangeScans use the steady_clock, it's not easy to look at a
timestamp (e.g. range scan create_time) and understand how it relates
to "now".

Including the "now" time helps to understand the timestamps which
RangeScan::addStats includes.
