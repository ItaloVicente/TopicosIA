DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: Fix Collections;:DocKey::make when separator is a dollar

The system keys currently have a $ prefix which is breaking the
findCollection methods when the separator is configured as $. Only
namespace::System keys are affected as if a user wrote a key with
a $ prefix and $ separator, they're saying the collection is empty
(and not actually legal when collections is on).
