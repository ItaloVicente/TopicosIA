DESCRIPTION:

MB-46729: Remove GTEST binding to fake_executorpool

As part of promoting the executor pool from ep-engine we want
to get rid of the implicit creation of the executor pool,
but instead move to an explicit creation of the pool (as part
of process startup).

By doing that we also want to move the creation of the
executor pools to a static method, and we can might as well
use that to create the fake pool (and we don't want gtest
in there so replace the EXPECT with throw)
