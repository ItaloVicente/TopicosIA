DESCRIPTION:

MB-36948 [Ephe]: Introduce max-visible-seqno in Sequential Storage

Add the max-visible-seqno into the Sequential storage for Ephemeral.
MVS accounts only committed items (ie, not Prepare and Abort). It is
sent in the SnapshotMarker for backfill-snapshots. It is the seqno of
the last item sent in backfill-snapshots to non-SyncRepl consumers.
