DESCRIPTION:

MB-36948 [Ephe]: Introduce max-visible-seqno in Sequential Storage

Add the max-visible-seqno into the Sequential storage for Ephemeral.
MVS accounts only committed items (ie, not Prepare and Abort). It is
sent in the SnapshotMarker for backfill-snapshots. It is the seqno of
the last item sent in backfill-snapshots to non-SyncRepl consumers.

Line:240, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> The vbucket max-visible seqno is different to the value you are tracking.

If we ask the vbucket for the max visible seqno, it should return the seqno of the most recently queued (queueDirty) commit/mutation, basically a different view of VBucket::getHighSeqno, which just asks checkpointManager for the lastBySeqno (the code I'm talking about is done, see line 789 here http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/118637/4/engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc).

The queueDirty value, and the seq-list value could differ because we do the two changes under different locks

For the value you are tracking we just need a different name, relevant to the seq-list, and it doesn't need exposing at the VBucket level, only at EphmeralVBucket.

Line:240, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> So yes I totally agree with you, this is supposed to be temporary, I should have put a comment.
If you see I've added the implementation only for EpheVB.

I think that in general at VBucket we may expose the same as for HighSeqno, ie getMVS() and getPersistedMVS() ?
Obviously they are the same for Ephe.

I can completely remove this and let you add it back in the patch that you linked above.
Or, I can replace this with getPersistedMVS() (I guess that we will use it in some way, at least for stats).

Line:171, engines/ep/src/linked_list.h -> This *must* take a ref to sequenceLock too.

All the update*Seqno() functions should. We don't have any issue because we always call them under sequenceLock, but the interface should force it.
