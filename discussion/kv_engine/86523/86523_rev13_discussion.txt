DESCRIPTION:

MB-25624[1]: Add a file logger implementation which uses spdlog

Add a file logger implementation which uses spdlog, based on the model
of file_logger.cc. It preserves the behaviour and log format of our
current logger and uses the same extension interface.

Line:100, tests/logger_test/spdlogger_test.cc -> Nit: for future reference, there's an EXPECT_TRUE macro you can use when just checking something is true.

The code is generally good, there is just a few loose ends we need to look at:

1) we need to flush the buffer after "sleeptime" the current model only flush the buffer when it's full, which means that if the server is deadlockd or something and not producing more output we won't see the most recent information

2) the file naming differs from the old model which means that it'll breaks scripts which may use them. Most important of those scripts is probably cbcollect_info which concat's all of these files into a single file by sorting them.( I've always thought that doing this one way transformation on the customers site was really stupid). It'll currently end up by putting all of the fragments in the wrong order...
