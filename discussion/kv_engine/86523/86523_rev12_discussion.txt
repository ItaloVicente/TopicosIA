DESCRIPTION:

MB-25624[1]: Add a file logger implementation which uses spdlog

Add a file logger implementation which uses spdlog, based on the model
of file_logger.cc. It preserves the behaviour and log format of our
current logger and uses the same extension interface.

Line:28, extensions/loggers/custom_rotating_file_sink.h -> /nit logfiles -> log files

Line:28, extensions/loggers/custom_rotating_file_sink.h -> cancatenated -> concatenated

Line:119, extensions/loggers/spdlogger.cc -> Would it be better to have this defined as a constant somewhere so it is easier to find/change in the future if we decide 5 seconds is too long/short?

Line:263, extensions/loggers/spdlogger.cc -> If this is the case, would it be better to have this defined as a constant somewhere where it can be accessed by all things using it? This would also avoid duplication and potential inconsistency issues in future.

Looking good - couple of comments.
Line:31, extensions/loggers/custom_rotating_file_sink.cc -> Suggest you make this a constructor argument.

Line:22, extensions/loggers/custom_rotating_file_sink.h -> I don't believe you need to include this in the header (I can't see any mention of it here). Please move to .cc

Line:26, extensions/loggers/custom_rotating_file_sink.h -> If this is essentially a copy of their code, we need to include their copyright header above. Then add a paragraph with our copyright / header).

Line:62, extensions/loggers/custom_rotating_file_sink.h -> Note: these can be const (as they don't appear to ever change).

Line:22, extensions/loggers/custom_rotating_file_sink.h -> I'll just delete it actually, it's from a previous implementation.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:119, extensions/loggers/spdlogger.cc -> Since it's only used here, I don't think there's much point in making it a constant. It's not something we'd change very often anyways. 5 seconds in log times should be more than plenty for deduplication

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:263, extensions/loggers/spdlogger.cc -> Well pointed out. It's a bit difficult right now to make it a global constant that even the tests can access, since we don't have a header for this source file just yet. spdlogger.cc and file_logger.cc are meant to be loaded as plugins at runtime, but this should change pretty soon.

I'll still make it a constant in the source file, so it's more visible and easier to change.
