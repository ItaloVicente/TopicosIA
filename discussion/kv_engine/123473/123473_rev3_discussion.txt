DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Provide consistent scan snapshot

When a scan encounters an ENOMEM, we don't restart the scan, we try to
continue from where we left off. This change moves the magma seq index
iterator into the ScanContext in order to remain on the same magma
snapshot to provide a consistent snapshot view for the entire scan.
