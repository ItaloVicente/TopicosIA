DESCRIPTION:

MB-28941: Remove duplicate clock reads when tracing

Currently a number of the Session Tracing events essentially duplicate
existing timed durations; however they perform their own clock
reads. This is both inefficient (reading the clock costs cycles;
particulary on virtualized systems), and inprecise - we cant' easily
compare the timestamps in the histograms with the cookie's timings as
they are timing slightly different durations.

To address this, make use of the new ScopeTimer RAII classes to time
the start & end just once, but broadcast those time values to both the
per-bucket historgrams and per-Cookie Tracing.

Note that as part of this we no longer distinguish between EvpStore
and EvpStoreIf in the Session Tracing, as one is implemented in terms
of the other (we didn't have seperate histograms for them). Splitting
them apart was probably more detail than users care about anyway, so I
don't think this is a problem.

Line:103, daemon/protocol/mcbp/engine_wrapper.cc -> by nuking them from here we no longer have the trace from default_bucket

Line:103, daemon/protocol/mcbp/engine_wrapper.cc -> True, however by moving them into ep-engine we remove 2x ProcessClock::now calls (begin/end) for each method; as we can re-use the start/stop times already used for the histograms.

I don't believe there was a requirement for sessions tracing for memcache buckets; if you think it's sufficiently valuable I can re-add these macros directly into default_engine, but you'd likely be looking at a ~6-7% slowdown compared to spock (that's what the total cost of Session Tracing was before I started optimising).
