DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add support for magma memory quota

Memory is maintained across 3 magma components; Bloom filters, Block
cache and Write cache. The least important of these is the write cache.
If there is insufficient memory for the write cache, the write cache
will grow to the size of the batch and then be immediately flushed and
freed. If there is available memory, the write cache is limited to 20%
of the available memory (after bloom filter and block cache get their
memory up to magma_max_write_cache (128MB). Bloom filters are the most
important and are never paged out. Bloom filter memory can cause magma
to go above the memory quota. To alleviate this, the bottom layer where
the majority of bloom filter memory is, won't use bloom filters when
OptimizeBloomFilterForMisses is on (which it is by default). The block
cache grows each time the index sizes change. But its growth is bounded
by the available memory or what's left over after the bloom filter
memory is subtracted.

Line:91, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> This probably isn't the correct way to handle this. Any actor which needs to know about memory quota changing should register a ValueChangedListener on the `max_size` property.

Line:418, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Please document this method.

Line:420, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Given KVShard objects don't necessarily know how many shards exist in total, shouldn't the bucketQuota be divided by the number of shards before calling KVStore::updateMemoryQuota() ?

Line:422, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Memory changing is rare (and likely to cause a bunch of work on the backend anyways), so no need for this to be inline - please de-inline.

Line:927, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> Nothing to to with magma in the base kvstore class.

Line:463, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Why is this public? Seems odd that we should expose a public method to access Magma's internal config type.

Line:91, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> I don't understand. Isn't this an actor on max_size? Why do we need multiple actors for the same thing?
This was the location pointed out to me.

Line:418, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Done

Line:420, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> The calculation is taken care of in magma-kvstore.cc::updateMemoryQuota where both the # of shards and the Ratio of the amount of the bucket quota the storage engine can use is taken into consideration.

Line:422, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.h -> Done

Line:927, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> Done

Line:463, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> configuration is stored in kvstore.h. MagmaKVStoreConfig is a union on top of configuration. In order to get to the magma specifics of configuration we need a way to cast configuration as MagmaKVStoreConfig. Unless we store a pointer to MagmaKVStoreConfig as part of MagmaKVStore class, its the way to get at the magma specific configuration parameters outside of the MagmaKVStore constructor.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:91, engines/ep/src/kv_bucket.cc -> So the Configuration has a listening interface so the particular actors in the system which care about memory quota (or any other config setting) can listen to be notified about changes in it.

Note that KVStoreConfig already has listeners for storage-related config options, hence it makes sense to add something similar (say in the MagmaKVStore) where a particular subclass cares about a config option. That avoids adding adding `updateMemoryQuota` to the base class though only one subclass cares about it.
