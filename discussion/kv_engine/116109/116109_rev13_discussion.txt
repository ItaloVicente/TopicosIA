DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add support for magma memory quota

Memory is maintained across 3 magma components; Bloom filters, Block
cache and Write cache. The least important of these is the write cache.
If there is insufficient memory for the write cache, the write cache
will grow to the size of the batch and then be immediately flushed and
freed. If there is available memory, the write cache is limited to 20%
of the available memory (after bloom filter and block cache get their
memory up to magma_max_write_cache (128MB). Bloom filters are the most
important and are never paged out. Bloom filter memory can cause magma
to go above the memory quota. To alleviate this, the bottom layer where
the majority of bloom filter memory is, won't use bloom filters when
OptimizeBloomFilterForMisses is on (which it is by default). The block
cache grows each time the index sizes change. But its growth is bounded
by the available memory or what's left over after the bloom filter
memory is subtracted.

(4 comments)
Line:776, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> If you're executing inside MagmaKVStore there's no need for the dynamic_cast

Line:777, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> prefer use of parentheses for explicit associativity, e.g.  (size/shards) * ratio

Line:6745, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> whitespace change - if you redo the commit i.e. just your single line changes in the following blocks) you don't need to run clang-format on this file

Line:2923, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> are the begin/set/commit blocks required? can the test not just be setMaxDataSize and then read the stats?

Line:776, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Unfortunately, no. configuration is on KVStore, not on MagmaKVStore so it requires a dynamic cast.

Line:777, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Done

Line:6745, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Done

Line:2923, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> The test requires the begin/commit blocks in order to force mem quota changes. The block cache, write cache and bloom filter quotas are changed after each commit batch to reflect changes in bucket quota. As data grows, it increases the bloom filter and block cache memory needs and takes memory away from the write cache.

Line:776, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> No request to change this, there's plenty of times we do this through the code already, not sure if it's always required in all places and here it really won't make any difference

Line:2923, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> and can you just do a single store for each block instead of 5?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:776, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> When we create a magma-kvstore, we create a MagmaKVStoreConfig, should be no need for the dynamic cast because configuration is always a magma config, it should never be any other type

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2923, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kvstore_test.cc -> can you add comments to say why the begin/set/commit blocks exist
