DESCRIPTION:

MB-27146: add err msg for non-KVnode cbstats calls

Instead of exiting with "mc_bin_client.ErrorKeyEnoent: Memcached error #1:
KEY_ENOENT : Not Found :" any time a cbstats call is executed against a
node that is not running the Data (KV) Service, catch and specifically
handle this error - printing a more user-friendly error message.

Line:114, engines/ep/management/cli_auth_utils.py -> Style: 

- First letter of sentence is not capitalised.
- Exclamation mark isn't in line with other messages.
- Message is arguably still at bit prescriptive - it doesn't actually tell the user what the problem is par-se. I'd suggest something more along the lines of describing what the problem is (that no bucket with the given name exists), and then possible solutions.

Note from looking at the code (https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/daemon/protocol/mcbp/select_bucket_executor.cc#L63), it _appears_ that key_enoent could still be returned for a case where the specified bucket name doesn't exist. Out of interest what happens if the allBuckets (-a?) argument to cbstats is passed when you target a non- Data Service node?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:114, engines/ep/management/cli_auth_utils.py -> Good points, thanks. Passing -a returns "No accessible buckets found" because of https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/engines/ep/management/cli_auth_utils.py#L94-L97.

Since, AIUI:
* All nodes run memcached, but without the Data Service configured there are no buckets present;
* The !mayAccessBucket (https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/daemon/protocol/mcbp/select_bucket_executor.cc#L26) block is entered only if the bucket was not explicitly named as accessible to the user, and the user does not have wildcard permissions;
* associate_bucket returns false if there is no bucket found with that name, or there is but it is in a state other than Ready

Both of these conditions must hold to fall through to key_enoent, i.e.,
* User must have a permissions entry to that bucket name, or a wildcard entry
* No Ready bucket with the given name [at the time the lock is held] on the specified node's memcached

So key_enoent is raised when either:
(1) the bucket doesn't exist and the user has wildcard permissions;
(2) the bucket exists in the _cluster_ (and so the permissions map), but this is a non-data node and so no bucket with that name is found by memcached;

But it's also raised in cases we may want to be more explicit about:
(3) The user has permissions and the bucket exists but is not yet active on the supplied node (e.g., Creating, Initializing, Stopping, Destroying).
