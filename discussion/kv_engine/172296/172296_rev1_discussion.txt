DESCRIPTION:

MB-27146: add err msg for non-KVnode cbstats calls

Instead of raising "mc_bin_client.ErrorKeyEnoent: Memcached error #1:
KEY_ENOENT : Not Found :" any time a cbstats call is executed against a
node that is not running the Data (KV) Service, catch and specifically
handle this error - printing a more user-friendly error message.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> If you try to connect to a non data node on:11200 what happens? Have you tested this as I thought it would just wouldn't connect rather than not give us stats?

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yeah, errors with KEY_ENOENT for non-data nodes but stats call succeeds on a data node.

Line:95, engines/ep/management/clitool.py -> I think this catch is too general / assuming what the underlying problem is.

From the MB's backtrace, the mc_bin_client exception being thrown was from the bucket_select() method, when the specified bucket does not exist.

I believe that exception could equally be printed if the specified bucket does not exist, but the node is otherwise a valid Data Service node (some context: we run memcached on _all_ cluster nodes for the purposes of client bootstrap, but on non Data Service nodes they have no buckets at all present.

I think you need to add an exception handler in a more specific place - say the `g` function in cli_auth_utils.py.

In terms of testing, I would experiment with what behaviour you see from cbstats when:

1. Requesting stats from a Data Service node for a valid bucket name and which the user has access to.
2. As (1), but bucket name which does not exist.
3. As (1), but for a bucket which the user does not have permission to access.
4. Requesting stats from a non- Data Service node (which by definition has zero buckets) with a valid username / password
5. As (4), but with an invalid username password.

In all cases, we should aim to give an error message which is meaningful, but doesn't mislead the user. For example, I believe at the moment for case (2) your current error message "cbstats must be executed against a data node" will be printed.

Line:95, engines/ep/management/clitool.py -> Good point. I didn't test permissions etc., but seem to have gotten away with it this time since all those cases work as expected:
(1) Success
(2) "No access to bucket:{bucket} - permission denied or bucket does not exist."
(3) "No access to bucket:{bucket} - permission denied or bucket does not exist."
(4) "cbstats must be executed against a data node!"
(5) "Authentication error for user:{user} bucket:{bucket}

Line:95, engines/ep/management/clitool.py -> That's not to say all cases work, though. Will move to g in cli_auth_utils.py since that's where the other exceptions are already.

Line:95, engines/ep/management/clitool.py -> (and the try/except is less catchy)
