DESCRIPTION:

MB-45026: Don't expel items pointed by cursors

Currently there is an inconsistency in the behaviour, as an item pointed
by a cursor may be expelled or not depending on whether it is at
high-seqno.

Here we make the behaviour consistent by always preserving items
referenced by cursor. That also prevents any issue related to the
possibility of having invalid cursors around.
