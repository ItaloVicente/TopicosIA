DESCRIPTION:

MB-47604: Have CompactionContext update rollbackPurgeSeqno

For NexusKVStore we need to know the highest purged seqno before we
can enable implicit compaction or concurrent flush and compaction. To
get this we could add and track a new seqno but this is only required
for NexusKVStore. It makes more sense to instead call some function on
CompactionContext for each purged item, and defer to subclasses for the
required action. This also allows us to tidy up the purging behaviours
which may/may not update seqnos based on the type of item purged and use
common code for all KVStores.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:138, engines/ep/src/kvstore/kvstore.h -> I'd ask for clion give us a spelling checker but it would probably need another CPU and 2GB of RAM to do it...
