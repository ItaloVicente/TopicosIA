DESCRIPTION:

Make all histogram stats generate HistogramData

Prelude to introducing Prometheus as a stats output.

Now all variants of HdrHistogram and Histogram are first turned into a
common type, HistogramData, to then be formatted. This indirection
means both the existing stats and future Prometheus stats backends need
only support a single type to handle all existing Histograms.
