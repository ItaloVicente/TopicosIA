DESCRIPTION:

MB-32117: Refactor iterator access

In this patch:
- I avoid functions that return references of tracking iterators, which
  could lead to subtle errors when we switch to a full multithreaded
  DurabilityMonitor implementation
- I remove some unnecessary functions, which helps in simplifying the
  code
- I move some internal-state sanity checks from the removed funtions to
  the proper locations
