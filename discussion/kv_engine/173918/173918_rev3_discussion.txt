DESCRIPTION:

MB-51805, MB-51806: Inherit HPS from previous Checkpoint

MB-51805:

Whilst the previous change in this chain fixes the issue on the neo
branch, a cherry-pick of this set of changes do not solve this
issue on the master branch.
https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/173044 removed the
Checkpoint re-use optimization on the master branch on which the
previous change (to load the PPS from disk into the CheckpointManager)
relies. On the master branch, when we receive our first SnapshotMarker
we create a new snapshot in the CheckpointManager which will actually
create a new Checkpoint. The HPS value that we have loaded from disk
and passed into the Checkpoint will no longer be correct.
Whilst we would normally just fix this on the master branch, we are
making the same change for MB-51806 anyway and I feel that it's
important to highlight the dual purpose of the change here.

In each Checkpoint we store a highPreparedSeqno value. This value is
later persisted to disk when we persist the last value in the
snapshot as the highPreparedSeqno. Currently each Checkpoint's
highPreparedSeqno value is independent to the Checkpoint. It will
only be set if we see a prepare in the Checkpoint. As we have a
default value of 0 we would see this value bounce between 0 and
an appropriate value if we dump the contents of the CheckpointManager.

This logically doesn't make loads of sense, as the highPreparedSeqno
should not only be Monotonic in a Checkpoint, it should also be
Monotonic across Checkpoints. In this change we are going to pre-load
each new Checkpoint with the value from the previous Checkpoint. This
fixes an issue where a replica node received a partial snapshot which
contained a prepare and restarted, before receiving the rest of the
snapshot which did not contain a prepare. Whilst we have already
corrected the in-memory HPS value in this case, the on disk HPS value
would remain at 0 for lack of a value to persist. This was due to a
particular behaviour in PassiveStream; the first snapshot in any
PassiveStream creates a new Checkpoint. Whilst we were loading the
HPS into the CheckpointManager, the creation of the new Checkpoint on
new snapshot in the PassiveStream meant that this value was "lost"
until this change.

MB-51806:

Currently we only update the highPreparedSeqno on disk if we are
persisting the item at the end of a snapshot. This is correct, but
fails to take into account that a Checkpoint only sets it's HPS
value when it sees a prepare. We could have a flush batch such that
we persist no item at a snapshot end for Checkpoints containing
prepares and the HPS is not moved when it should be. E.g.

[1:Pre(key1), 2:Mutation(key2)][3:Mutation(key2)]
             ^
         HPS = 1

When visited by the flusher the HPS of 1 is not persisted. This allows
for a scenario where a replica node restarts and the HPS goes backwards
as this node would still ack 1 back to the Producer. If the cluster
has two replicas and the other replica is behind, it's possible for it
to be picked for promotion over this node. See MB for full scenario.

This change fixes this issue as the second Checkpoint inherits the
highPreparedSeqno value from the previous one, and rather than finding
no value to flush, it finds the correct value of 1.
