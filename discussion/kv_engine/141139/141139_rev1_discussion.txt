DESCRIPTION:

MB-42977: Abort cluster_test if node terminates unexpectedly

If a cluster_testapp node suffers a problem and terminates
prematurely, then the cluster_testapp may not notice and can result in
the test eventually being timed out by CTest.

To "fail fast" and aid in debugging such issues, modify NodeImpl to
add a background thread which monitors the child process. If it
terminates before the node is cleanly shutdown (NodeImpl dtor), throw
an exception which will termiante the test.

Note this changes NodeImpl to use folly::Subprocess to spawn and
monitor the child process, as that removes the platform-specific code
previously needed here.
