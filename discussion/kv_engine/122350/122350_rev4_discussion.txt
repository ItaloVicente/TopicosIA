DESCRIPTION:

MB-37898: GoogleTest: s/TEST_CASE/TEST_SUITE/

Version 1.10 of GoogleTest has moved from referring to a group of
tests as a "Test Case", to the more common term "Test Suite". As such,
the old API functions (e.g. INSTANTIATE_TEST_CASE_P) have been
deprecated.

Replace with the new TEST_SUITE variant.

Change-Id: I73175407b952acbfbb418d879b2d03dd2f408267
