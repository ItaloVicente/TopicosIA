DESCRIPTION:

MB-54072: Add test configuration builder

This config builder will allow us to reduce config string duplication in
parameterized tests.

I will replace the engine config literals with instances of Config in a
future patch.

Line:86, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/config.h -> Ooooh, looks like an implicit conversion operator to something like testing::internal::ParamGenerator<std::string> (e.g., returning `testing::ValuesIn(toStrings())`) would let this config be used directly in INSTANTIATE_TEST_SUITE_P declarations

On the other hand, as you've noted in other comments probably best to avoid poking around in internal for stability if we upgrade :feelsbad:

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Overriding BuildBot: known intermittent failure 
Line:86, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/config.h -> Hmm, we've got auto return types in C++, we don't have to depend on testing::internal::ParamGenerator<T> in the function signature 👍

Line:86, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/config.h -> Aye, this is true! :makeitso:

Even without auto we could have done a lil' decltype dance if we were desperate
