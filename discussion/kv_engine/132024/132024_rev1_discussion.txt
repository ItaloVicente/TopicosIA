DESCRIPTION:

MB-40258: Update AtomicMontonic so we can resize containers

A vector<AtomicMontonic> cannot be 'resized' because an AtomicMononic
has a deleted copy constructor.

Patch adds the copy constructor (which uses reset on the copy) and
changes CouchKVStore to use resize for dbFileRevMap creation.

Patch Set 1: Code-Review-1

I think we are missing something here. According to cppreference.com, vector::resize()[1] performs default-insertion of the type. DefaultInsertable[2] seems to boil down to just calling placement-new on the type - i.e.

 ::new((void*)p) T()

which I would have _thought_ AtomicMonotonic supported already?

Isn't it required to be MoveInsertable as well as DefaultInsertable in case resize() needs to reallocate and move some existing values?

https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector/resize

> void resize( size_type count ); (1)
> void resize( size_type count, const value_type& value ); (2)

> T must meet the requirements of MoveInsertable and DefaultInsertable in order to use overload (1). 
> T must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload (2). 

Whereas in the second case the given value needs to be copied in (so the type doesn't need to be default constructed), and being CopyInsertable implies the type is also MoveInsertable

> The type T is CopyInsertable into the container X whose value_type is identical to T if T is MoveInsertable into X, and, given...

OOI, are they accessed outside the folly synchronized lock? Like, are iterators/references held to the atomic and used after the lock is dropped?

If not, couldn't they be non-atomic Monotonics? If the lock need always be held to read/write them?
If _so_, would't resize invalidate said references/iterators if it reallocated? (so I'm guessing they aren't used like this, for that reason?)

Though if resize is only used at creation time then the branch B of that isn't relevant re: iterators/references

Good point - might be simpler to just use Monotonic<> ?

True now we have locked access always, can be Monotonic

resize is a one off, previously we constructed the vector as the correct size, but folly::Sync doesn't allow for non-default consrtuction 😞
