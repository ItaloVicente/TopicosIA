DESCRIPTION:

MB-38999: Re-register cursor in markOSODiskSnapshot

MB highlighted that the OSO snapshot code was missing
an important part of cursor registration. Once the
scan begins and calls back to markOSODiskSnapshot we must
ensure the cursor is registered so that the transition
from disk to memory doesn't miss or repeat any data.
Basically cloned from markDiskSnapshot
