DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Read vbstate from disk for scans

MB-35631 changed when cachedVBState gets updated so the latest vbstate
is found on disk, not in the cache. Scans should use the latest
vbstate. To fix this, we need to add a new function that reads vbstate
from disk without loading the cache. To do this, we'll rename the
existing function, readVBStateFromDisk to loadVBStateCache and repurpose
the old function to just reading the vbstate from disk.

The test added reflects the current broken state of dcp scans which
don't retain the scan snapshot. That will be fixed in a subsequent
checkin.

Note: MagmaInfo is being simplified for this patch in order to make it
easy to get this patch checked in without adding complicated copy
operators since the following patch is going to do way with MagmaInfo.

Its unclear how MB-35631 did not cause a tsan race condition but this
patch fixes that issue.
