DESCRIPTION:

MB-37798: Read vbstate from disk for scans

MB-35631 changed when cachedVBState gets updated so the latest vbstate
is found on disk, not in the cache. Scans should use the latest
vbstate. To fix this, we need to add a new function that reads vbstate
from disk without loading the cache. To do this, we'll rename the
existing function, readVBStateFromDisk to loadVBStateCache and repurpose
the old function to just reading the vbstate from disk.

The test added reflects the current broken state of dcp scans which
don't retain the scan snapshot. That will be fixed in a subsequent
checkin.

Its unclear how MB-35631 did not cause a tsan race condition but this
patch fixes that issue.

Line:1428, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> I can see this is just the way magma code has developed, seems more correct to say != OK (and is clearer to given the use of auto status) and imho it's better that the code does not assume OK is 0, i'd say change the ones in this patch, and mabe it becomes habit moving forwards

Line:2159, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> maybe compare != OK for clarity (and the code would still work regardless of the value of OK)

Line:435, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> nit: everything in a struct is public by default.

Line:1429, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Also suggest including a warning / error log message here.

Line:1665, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Style: I'd just default-construct a vbucket_state / MagmaInfo here - it makes it explicit to the reader that's what is returned without having to read up to see the last time `vbstate` /  `magmaInfo` was modified.

Line:1677, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Same comment here.

Line:1690, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Style: Safer to construct / assign an entire MagmaInfo object here, instead of assigning each individual member - if in future members are added then the compiler will error, whereas here we'd end up with a defaulted member silently.

Line:1696, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Nit: readState can be const.

Line:2156, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> As an aside (question for Scott?) why are we using shared_timed_mutex? I don't see any use of the timed aspect. Prefer folly::SharedMutex.

Line:32, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Should be "vbucket_state.h"
