DESCRIPTION:

Tighten DCP packet validators to ensure the correct DCP use

The packets in DCP may only be used in a given sequence as
described in: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/dcp-documentation

Deleted DCP tests which really didn't test DCP (and ep-engine
has it's own test suite which _do_ test this)

Probably worth validating that `simple-test` passes for this change given our limited DCP protocol unit testing...

Patch Set 14:

I'm currently looping that.. I am seeing some test failures every now and then (and I've replaced where I'm returning "errors" with aborts() but not seeing that so I'm not sure if its related to my patch or not... so still running verifications.. tempted to wait for mad-hatter unless I'm confident that we're not doing something yacky

Yeah, might be a good shout given how close we are - if nothing else could be some misbehaving clients out there...
