DESCRIPTION:

Tighten DCP packet validators to ensure the correct DCP use

The packets in DCP may only be used in a given sequence as
described in: https://github.com/couchbaselabs/dcp-documentation

Deleted DCP tests which really didn't test DCP (and ep-engine
has it's own test suite which _do_ test this)

ns_server used DCP_GET_FAILOVER_LOG incorrectly, but is
fixed in: http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/92133/

A spin-off of this is MB-29117 which we've added a temporary
guard around for in DcpConsumer
