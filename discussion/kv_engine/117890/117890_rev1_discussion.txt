DESCRIPTION:

MB-36794: Update highest deduped seqno on abort

We need to update the highest deduped seqno of the seqList when
we overwrite a prepare with an abort or we can end up streaming
an abort from memory that has de-duplicated the prepare before
it. This is an issue as we will fail sanity checks on the replica
and tear down the DCP connection.
