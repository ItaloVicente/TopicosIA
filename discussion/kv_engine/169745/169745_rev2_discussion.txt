DESCRIPTION:

MB-50600: Use KVStoreRevision in prepareToDelete et. al.

Magma and couchstore vBuckets deal with revisioning slightly differently
if an item has not yet been written to a vBucket. Nexus needs to be able
to deal with that when we delete a vBucket revision as currently it tries
to delete the revision of the primary KVStore on the secondary. This may
fail if the KVStores revisions are not the same. Add a KVStoreRevision
class which wraps the uint64_t revision value to allow NexusKVStore to
use polymorphism to return a child type containing both revisions in a
future change.
