DESCRIPTION:

MB-24470: Do not add temp items to the sequence list

In certain cases of delete_with_meta() we add a short lived temp item
in the hashtable and then immediately generate a valid seqno to it,
hence making it a non-temp item. In Ephemeral buckets, this item
while temp is put onto the sequence list with a negative seqno (temp
items have negative seqno in ep-engine). Having a negative seqno
item in the sequence list can cause problems for range (sequential)
readers like DCP, tombstone purge.

This commit ensures that we do not add to temp item on the
sequence list. Temp item is still added on the hash table of legacy
reasons. When the temp item is updated, that is made "non-temp", we
put it onto the sequence list under the "list write lock" and
generate a valid sequence number to it.

The commit also adds some module tests for the same.
It is also enables certain XDCR functional unit tests that were
disabled for ephemeral buckets.

(2 comments)

Bug fix generally looks good, but this is a large patch (+436, -187) which does multiple things. Please split into smaller patches - prefer to seperate refactorings (which should not change externally-visible behaviour) from bug fixes (which do change behaviour).
Line:151, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> Style: it's easier to follow the bugfix if you did the initial refactor from a pointer to a reference in a separate patch.

Line:581, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Prefer solving this in a static way - i.e. make it impossible to call this function in Ephemeral by it not existing (don't make it virtual) and having the Warmup code operate on the specific EPVBucket type.

Line:151, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> Ok will split up the big patch

Line:581, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> That requires a much bigger refactor. Warmup should be initialized with reference to EPBucket rather than KVBucket. EPBucket should have EPVBucket map rather than KVBucket having one vbmap. (Lot more associated stuff would tag along)

Line:581, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> Or we could do a dynamic_cast on vbucket at the warmup level, but that would not be much different from this

Line:151, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.h -> It is not simple to break as pointer to ref refactor and then bug fix in temp items.
Because once we change the pointer to ref, temp items will have to be handled differently and that leads to the bug fix change.

Line:581, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> This is moved to another commit now
