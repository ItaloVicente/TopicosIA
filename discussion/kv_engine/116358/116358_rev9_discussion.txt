DESCRIPTION:

MB-36372: 2/4 Always hold the vbucket state lock for setVBucketState

There exists a race in set vbucket (opcode 0x3d) which is fixed by
ensuring the vbucket's state lock is always held when calling
setVBucketState_UNLOCKED. When a vbucket's state changes due to
takeover there is no race because the vbucket's state mutex is locked by
ActiveStream::setVBucketStateAckRecieved.

This commit addresses the race by making the locking of the vbucket
state mutex consistent between the ActiveStream use-case and set vbucket
(opcode 0x3d).

The race:

Within setVBucketState_UNLOCKED, when the state change is from:active
to:dead a list of sync-writes which should be completed with 'durability
ambiguous' is gathered. If setVBucketState_UNLOCKED is being called for
set vbucket (opcode 0x3d) then the vbucket's state lock is not yet held,
thus once a list of eligible sync-writes has been obtained, new
sync-writes can become eligible but are left behind, their associated
connection is then never notified (notifyIOComplete).
