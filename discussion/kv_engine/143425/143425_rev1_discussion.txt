DESCRIPTION:

MB-43621: Don't count aborts towards on_disk_prepare_bytes

We have a few tests that try to track on_disk_prepare_size but they
used the cachedVBState which wasn't updated post flush. We shouldn't
count aborts towards on_disk_prepare_bytes as we must keep them for
the metadata purge interval to ensure that replicas can reconnect
correctly. As such their inclusion in on_disk_prepare_bytes would
potentially trigger unnecessary compactions.
