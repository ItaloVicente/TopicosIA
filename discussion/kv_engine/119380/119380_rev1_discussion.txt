This commit is the end of the branch for the magma backport patches to mad-hatter branch. This is the only patch that was not a backport, had to re-enable some flags we disabled in mad-hatter branch for magma (and rocks) to run. You can use the refspec from this patch to create a toy build. All magma unit tests (that are enabled in mad-hatter branch) passed when I ran this locally on macOS.

Hey Sarath, this patch is at the end of a branch containing all of those commits and a few extra that were needed such as memory quota change. I can add you as reviewer to all the others if you like but they're currently hidden as they're drafts to avoid running unnecessary CV
