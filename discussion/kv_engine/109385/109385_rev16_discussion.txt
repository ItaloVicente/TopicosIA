DESCRIPTION:

MB-33463: Add support for synchronous compaction

Compaction in magma is asynchronous. Its triggered by 4 conditions:
* Level compaction
* Expiry compaction
  In magma, a histogram of when items will expire is maintained.
  Periodically, magma will trigger a compaction to visit those sstables
  which have expired items to have them removed.
* Dropped collections removal
* Tests
  For tests which call compactDB, we will support synchronous
  compaction.

For DP, will will support level compaction and synchronous compaction.
