DESCRIPTION:

MB-16181: General improvements to collection stats

A number of tweaks to the documentation and the code. The primary
improvements are:

* Reduce superflous/duplicated data in keys, e.g. no need to include
  "manifest" repeatedly in collection-details.
* Return maxTTl when defined via a number of 'views'.
