DESCRIPTION:

MB-53939: allow for tuning TCP keepalive

Allow tuning of the TCP keepalive parameters:

    tcp_keepalive_idle number of seconds before first probe sent
    tcp_keepalive_interval number of seconds between each probe
    tcp_keepalive_probes number of probes missing before marked as dead

The new default setting is 5 minutes idle, 10 secs between each
probe and 3 probes without response -> dead.
