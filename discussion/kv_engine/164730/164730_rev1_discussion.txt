DESCRIPTION:

Verify GlobalTask::state in ExecutorPool methods

Check GlobalTask::state in the various ExecutorPool methods which
affect state (schedule, cancel etc). This helps to avoid incorrect
usage of the ExecutorPool (for example attempting to schedule a task
twice).

(This was added as part of investigating MB-47451 to confirm that the
ExecutorPool API was being used correctly. It didn't highlight any
current issues, but seems worthwhile to keep to help avoid any future
issues.)
