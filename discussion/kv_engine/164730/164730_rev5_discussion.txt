DESCRIPTION:

Verify GlobalTask::state in ExecutorPool methods

Check GlobalTask::state in the various ExecutorPool methods which
affect state (schedule, cancel etc). This helps to avoid incorrect
usage of the ExecutorPool (for example attempting to schedule a task
twice).

(This was added as part of investigating MB-47451 to confirm that the
ExecutorPool API was being used correctly. It didn't highlight any
current issues, but seems worthwhile to keep to help avoid any future
issues.)

Not as straightforward as seems to change; CB3ExecutorPool assumes tasks are created as RUNNING in various places.
