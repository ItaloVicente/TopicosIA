DESCRIPTION:

MB-24631: Ensure that bufferedBackfill.items is decremented correctly

There was an underflow in bufferedBackfill.items because it was
incremented for non meta DCP items were read, but decremented always
when an item was sent.

This commit fixes that and adds a test check for the same.

Line:564, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Curious as to why SystemEvents are being checked here, they shouldn't appear unless collections was enabled, even so some system-events  that come from disk should be treated very similarly to mutation/deletions?

Line:564, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> In ActiveStream::backfillReceived() we increment bufferedBackfill.items.
That is, we increment for all items received from disk. I understand system events are received from disk as well, like mutations.

No while decrementing, we must decrement only for the items read from disk, that is, only the items that had incremented bufferedBackfill.items before. So checking separately for system event which also a meta item, but must decrement bufferedBackfill.items here

Line:564, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Ah I'd misread the code as you have written !(a) || b.  I read the code as !(a || b)

Can you remove the superflous brackets around resp->isMetaEvent(), then it's much clearer as to what this statement is doing !
