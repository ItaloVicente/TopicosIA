DESCRIPTION:

MB-40531: [BP] Prefer paging from replicas if possible

Backport of http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/134806

Prior to this change, the pager would try to page out X% of items in
replica vbuckets, but if this did not bring memory usage below the low
water mark, it would flip phase to ACTIVE_AND_PENDING_ONLY - meaning
the next run of the pager would page immediately try to page from
active and pending vbuckets.

Now, active/pending vbuckets will only be considered if paging _every_
possible item from replicas would not free enough memory to drop below
the low water mark.

Note: On branch 'alice' HIFI MRU is the default eviction policy, but
2Bit LRU is still present. This change applis to HIFI MRU only.
