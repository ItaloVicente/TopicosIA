DESCRIPTION:

MB-30913: Rename members/methods in preparation for scopes

Many collections class members/methods are named such that
it only makes sense for them to deal with 1 type of object.
To simplify future patches, rename these members/methods so that
class interfaces deal with collections/scopes more consistently.

Leave the begin and end iterator methods of Manifest as we
generally wish to iterate over all collections of a Manifest.
