DESCRIPTION:

MB-43460: Fix collection accounting bug when col dropped but not flushed

Background
==========

When a collection is dropped when using Magma, we must use the
collection itemCount to decrement the overall VBucket item count
during compaction. This is because Magma cannot tell us if a document
being compacted (from the dropped collection) is the "current" version
of that document, or a "stale" version.

Bug
===

When dropping a collection with dirty mutations outstanding (for
example when a collection is dropped during a rebalance and the
replica node is still streaming the items from the collection), the
VBucket item count was not always decremented by the full collection
item count when cleaned up.

For example, consider a Bucket with collections c_A and c_B, each with
500 items. Collection c_B is dropped, which should result in the
overall vBucket item count dropping from 1000 to 500. However it is
only dropped by a fraction of c_B's item_count, say 400; resulting in
the VBucket item count incorrectly being 600.

The cause of the bug is related to the (somewhat complex) way
collection item counts are tracked during flushing (and also
compaction). The precise scenario which triggers the bug is as follows
- front-end DCP connection and background flusher task interleaved as
follows:

    Front-End                           Back-end Writer thread
    (Replica vBucket receiving          (flushing data to disk)
     data via DCP.)
    --------------------------------    --------------------------------

 1. Snapshot marker(disk)
    CreateCollection "C"
    Mutation to "C", key foo.

 2.                                     flushVBucket()
                                        - getItemsForCursor finds:
                                          CreateCollection(C) &
                                          Mutation
                                        - KVStore::saveDocs start to
                                          flush items...

 3. Mutation to "C" key bar.
    DropCollection "C"
    - updates in-memory manifest to
    mark "C" as dropped.

 4.                                     ... saveDocs finishes.
                                        - saveCollectionStats() called,
                                          calculates new collection item
                                          count from in-memory value
                                          plus what was just flushed
                                          (correctly 0+1=1).
 ***BUG***                              - postCommitMakeStatsVisible()
                                          called, sees that "C" is
                                          marked as deleted in Manifest,
                                          skips updating in-memory item
                                          count (should be 1, instead
                                          0).

 5.                                     flushVBucket()
                                        - getItemsForCursor finds:
                                          Mutation and DropCollection(C)
                                        - KVStore::saveDocs flushes
                                          items.
                                        - saveCollectionStats() called,
                                          calculates new collection item
                                          count from in-memory value
                                          plus what was just flushed
                                          (should be 1+1=2, instead
                                          0+1=1).

 6.                                     Compaction runs to clean up
                                        dropped collection, decrments
                                        collection num items (should be
                                        2, instead 1) from VBucket
                                        item count.

  ***BUG EXPOSED***
  VBucket item count is incorrectly reported as 1 instead of 0.

The problem is in step 4, where we consider a collection as dropped as
we read the in-memory state, yet the drop hasn't been written to disk.
As a consequence the in-memory collection item count is not updated.
(One might think this isn't an issue, given the collection _will_ be
dropped soon, however the correct collection item count is needed
later...)

At step 5, the collection is still not dropped from disk, so the
on-disk count still needs to be maintained. However, as it bases the
current collection item count from the (incorrect) in-memory count
from step 4, we write an incorrect collection size to disk.

Finally at step 6 when the dropped colleciton is cleaned up during
compaction, the (incorrect) on-disk item count is subtracted from the
VBucket item count; resulting in a VBucket item count of 1 instead of
0.  number of mutations to that collection.

Solution
========

postCommitMakeStatsVisible() is modified to apply flusher Stats to
dropped collections in additon to alive ones, by updating the
appropriate entry in the manifests' droppedCollections structure.

This means that the subsequent flush to disk of collections stats
(step 6) _does_ include the previously flushed items; and hence the
following collection cleanup will acount the dropped collection
correctly.
