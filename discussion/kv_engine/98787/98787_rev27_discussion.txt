DESCRIPTION:

Proof of concept of external authentication

This is a proof of concept implementation of supporting
external authentication from memcached (by using an external
provider). It is a bare minimum implementation with a lot
of limitations which needs to be fixed:

   * It currently only allows for a single provider connection
   * It'll wait "forever" for an authentication to complete
   * doesn't work properly for X.509 users when the users
     RBAC entry isn't local (@todo figure out if that'll
     be the case in the future?)
   * +++
