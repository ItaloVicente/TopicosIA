DESCRIPTION:

MB-28230: Move active compression to a separate ItemCompressorTask

The DefragmenterTask operates only on a smaller chunk of items at
a time, so that the hash table lock isn't held for too long that
will block front-end threads. Also, the defragmenter operates on a
10 second interval which is not active enough for active compression.
Moving it to a separate task would also allow for further customizations
and optimizations on when the task can get scheduled.
