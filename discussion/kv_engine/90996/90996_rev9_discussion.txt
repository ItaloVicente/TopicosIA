DESCRIPTION:

MB-28230: Move active compression to a separate ItemCompressorTask

The DefragmenterTask operates only on a smaller chunk of items at
a time, so that the hash table lock isn't held for too long that
will block front-end threads. Also, the defragmenter operates on a
10 second interval which is not active enough for active compression.
Moving it to a separate task would also allow for further customizations
and optimizations on when the task can get scheduled.

Also consider adding a performance benchmark (similar to the defragmenter one) which will be helpful in calibrating how often to run.

Suggestion for a follow-up: we should consider reducing the cost of compression when there's no compressible data - e.g. look at vBucket item counts and skip a vBucket when num_items == number of items with datatype snappy.
Line:303, engines/ep/configuration.json -> For the compressor task, we might want to use a unit smaller than seconds (milliseconds?) for the interval, as I imagine it could be useful to run more often than every second.

Line:315, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Please move these down so they are alphabetical (the file isn't 100% sorted I know, but let's try to at least make it get no worse :)

Line:554, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> comment needs updating.

Line:95, engines/ep/src/item_compressor.cc -> This needs updating also

Line:37, engines/ep/src/item_compressor.h -> Don't need void in C++

Line:39, engines/ep/src/item_compressor.h -> ditto

Line:46, engines/ep/src/item_compressor.h -> update

Line:49, engines/ep/src/item_compressor.h -> update

Line:70, engines/ep/src/item_compressor.h -> needs updating (or you could use #pragma once instead).

Line:6333, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Please revert the whitespace-only changes here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:6333, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Irrespective, please revert it - it creates a ~300 line whitespace-only change in this patch.

If you want to do a follow-up (whitespace-only) patch to reformat this; that's fine.
