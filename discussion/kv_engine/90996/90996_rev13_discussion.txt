DESCRIPTION:

MB-28230: Move active compression to a separate ItemCompressorTask

The DefragmenterTask operates only on a smaller chunk of items at
a time, so that the hash table lock isn't held for too long that
will block front-end threads. Also, the defragmenter operates on a
10 second interval which is not active enough for active compression.
Moving it to a separate task would also allow for further customizations
and optimizations on when the task can get scheduled.

File Comment: engines/ep/benchmarks/item_compressor_bench.cc -> Thanks for the benchmark!

Would be helpful to the reader / reviewer to include the output of this in the commit message, so we can see what rate we are currently achieving.
Line:128, engines/ep/benchmarks/item_compressor_bench.cc -> I wouldn't expect we'd run with a 1 minute chunk duration in production (given that would block the NON_IO thread for any other task).

If "1 minute" is being used to measure the performance when running "constantly", then that's fine, but I would suggest also adding another  test variant which runs with a realistic chunk duration (say 25ms) so we can benchmark how this is expected to perform in production.

Line:433, engines/ep/configuration.json -> milliseconds?

Line:107, engines/ep/src/item_compressor.cc -> Note this method takes a double to represent seconds; you'll need to convert from the integer millisecond value to a double second value.
