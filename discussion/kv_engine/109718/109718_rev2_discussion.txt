DESCRIPTION:

MB-34017 [SR]: Include the prepared-seqno in Commit/Abort queued items

When we complete a Prepare, we queue a Commit or Abort item into the
CheckpointManager.
At persistence of Commit/Abort, we don't know what is the Prepare
associated with that Commit/Abort.
While that information has never been necessary so far, now it is for
persisting the High Completed Seqno to disk.

This patch ensures that both the Commit and Abort queued items in CM
carry the seqno of the associated Prepare (ie, the prepared-seqno).

In follow-up patches, the prepared-seqno will be used at persistence for
computing the HCS and writing it to disk.

Line:637, engines/ep/src/ephemeral_vb.cc -> I believe Ben has implemented this now - might want to rebase on top of http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/109717/

Line:1209, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Given both queueCommit and queueDirty call these same lines, I think it's premature to split adjustExptime/flagXattrsInVBucket/adjustCasAndSeqno.. into their own functions.

Why not just move these lines into a single queueCommit/queueDirtyInner function or similar?
