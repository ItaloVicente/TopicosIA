DESCRIPTION:

MB-34017 [SR]: Include the prepared-seqno in Commit/Abort queued items

When we complete a Prepare, we queue a Commit or Abort item into the
CheckpointManager.
At persistence of Commit/Abort, we don't know what is the Prepare
associated with that Commit/Abort.
While that information has never been necessary so far, now it is for
persisting the High Completed Seqno to disk.

This patch ensures that both the Commit and Abort queued items in CM
carry the seqno of the associated Prepare (ie, the prepared-seqno).

In follow-up patches, the prepared-seqno will be used at persistence for
computing the HCS and writing it to disk.

Line:805, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> I think this adds more justification for the variant - or at the very least two explicit constructors for DurabilityItemCtx so the caller only has to specify either the Prepare or Commit/Abort version.

Line:89, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Possibly overkill, but given that only the durability::Requirements or the preparedSeqno are valid, you could put this and `requirements` in a variant to make that explicit.

(That assumes we can determine which type of operation - prepare or commit/abort - this DurabilityItemCtx is associated with - say if it's a queueDirty vs queueCommit/Abort)?
