DESCRIPTION:

MB-49489: Add magma_mem_quota_low_watermark_ratio to config.json

Until recently Magma's memory quota was only used to size the
write and block cache. Bloom filters were accounted for
in the computation but could not be evicted. We recently added
permanent eviction for bloom filters if they exceed the quota.

This requires magma's memory quota to be raised cos of which
magma_mem_quota_ratio has been increased to 0.5 ie. magma will
begin evicting bloom filters once we hit that limit.

We are also adding magma_mem_quota_low_watermark_ratio, this
will allow Magma to size it's write and block caches. The default
value of this config is 0.2. The memory quota for block and write
cache remains the same since the default
magma_mem_quota_low_watermark_ratio(0.2) * magma_mem_quota_ratio(0.5)
is 0.1 which was the old magma_mem_quota_ratio.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might be worth highlighting that the quota wasn't actually obeyed until MB-49489, hence the setting of "0.2" was essentially meaningless.

Line:1326, engines/ep/configuration.json -> "low watermark" feels a bit of a vague name - as I believe this doesn't necessarily represent the lower bound of the amount of memory which Magma will use. Could you expand the description on exactly what this quantity is for?

Line:275, engines/ep/src/kvstore/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore_config.h -> Please document this.

Line:150, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/magma-kvstore_test.cc -> The rest of the Magma stats here have a "magma_" prefix - any reason these ones do not?

Line:1326, engines/ep/configuration.json -> I deliberately left them a bit vague since the usage of this low watermark will probably change soon. Atm it is only write cache and block cache but in morpheus we will probably add more components. I am not sure it will get updated everytime we make changes in the memory computations within magma. Do I add them anyway?

Line:150, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/magma-kvstore_test.cc -> The memory related stats(memory_quota and write_cache_quota) did not have the magma_ prefix so I mirrored them.

Line:1326, engines/ep/configuration.json -> This documentation is mostly for internal use, so I think it would be helpful to give some detail of what the config param is used for.

Line:150, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/magma-kvstore_test.cc -> I can see an argument for not prefixing stats which care generic to different storage backends, but memory_quota_low_watermark, bloom_filter_memory_quota and write_cache_quota are all specific to Magma - Couchstore doesn't have equivalent stats.
