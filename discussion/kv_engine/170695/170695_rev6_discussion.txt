DESCRIPTION:

MB-49489: Add magma_mem_quota_low_watermark_ratio to config.json

Until recently Magma's memory quota was only used to size the
write and block cache. Bloom filters were accounted for
in the computation but could not be evicted. The bloom filters
consume one bytes per key, so it is possible at very low dgm
with a large number of items the bloom filters will exceed
Magma's memory quota. For eg with 1GB bucket quota, magma's
memory quota would be 100MB ie. magma would exceed it's quota
with 100 million items of size 1KB each at 1% dgm. We recently
added permanent eviction for bloom filters to ensure magma
remains within it's quota.

The additional bloom filters being accounted for requires Magma's
memory quota to be raised to a higher value since eviction of
bloom filters will result in a significant performance regression.
The prevent early eviction, magma_mem_quota_ratio has been
increased to 0.5 and Magma will begin evicting bloom filters once
we hit that limit.

We are also adding magma_mem_quota_low_watermark_ratio, this
will allow Magma to size it's write and block caches. The default
value of this config is 0.2. The memory quota for block and write
cache remains the same since the default
magma_mem_quota_low_watermark_ratio(0.2) * magma_mem_quota_ratio(0.5)
is 0.1 which was the old magma_mem_quota_ratio.
