DESCRIPTION:

MB-25509: Support calling fsync() periodically during compaction

Add a new config param 'fsync_after_every_n_bytes_written'. When set
to a non-null value, configures couchstore to issue a sync() after
every N bytes of compaction data is written.

The default value has been set at 16MB - local testing with 1.5GB
vBucket files suggests this is a good tradeoff between bg fetch
latency and compaction write throughput:

    avg_bg_wait_time (no compaction):    50-100μs
    avg_bg_wait_time (compaction, 16MB): 50-200μs

For comparision, when run with no automatic sync():

    avg_bg_wait_time (compactionB): 100,000-300,000μs

The value can be configured at runtime via epctl - for example to set
a 1MB period:

    cbepctl -u Administrator -p asdasd localhost:12000 -b <bucket> set flush_param fsync_after_every_n_bytes_written 1048576

Note: Only the compactor is currently affected - other writers (access
log, flusher) don't yet use this parameter.

Line:85, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> I probably should have spotted this on the couchstore patch but it seems really ridiculous that you can set the periodic sync value to any value on the ops interface but are restricted to a power of 2 on the couchstore API.

I don't get why you didn't just add a function to the couchstore API to allow setting this instead of faffing with flags.

Line:176, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> this seems like a really useful function that could live in couchstore

Line:626, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> I don't see why this needs to be in the header file

Line:6424, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Should the stat be added to stats.org as well?

Line:85, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-fs-stats.cc -> The existing API in couchstore uses a 64bit flags field in open; and this was initially developed on 4.5.1 (customer environment) where I wanted to minimise changes in the API / ABI as a hotfix may have have been needed.

Having said all that, looking a this in the light of the master branch it probably /would/ have been simpler to add a new function/method to enable periodic fsync (with any size class limit).

However, given the couchstore half has already been merged with the flags/power-of-2 approach (and this has been pretty well tested and works) I'm going to leave as-is. If we need to make any more significant changes in the area of couchstore config we can revisit the mechanism. At this point there's other fish to fry ;)

Line:176, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Agreed - will move to couchstore.

Line:626, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> Not sure either ;) I think it might have needed to be there before I shuffled things around. Will move to .cc

Line:6424, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> Really need to get a test for that :/

Line:6424, engines/ep/tests/ep_testsuite.cc -> There's a script in mortimer that converts stats.org to JSON so you might be able to jury-rig that.
