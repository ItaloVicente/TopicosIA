DESCRIPTION:

MB-38243: cookies should always have at least 1 element

As part of MB-38030 a regression was introduced causing the cookies
array to become empty and result in trying to follow a NIL pointer.
Previously we would shut down the connection for format errors, but
now we keep the connection open (and send an error message instead).

Line:545, daemon/connection.cc -> By MB description, we crash here, as calling ::back() on an empty deque is UB (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/deque/back).

From your fix I get that the assumption is that ::cookies is never empty, so we can Expects(!cookies.empty()) before we call ::back().
