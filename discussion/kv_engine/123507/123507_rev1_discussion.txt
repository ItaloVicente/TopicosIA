DESCRIPTION:

MB-38243: cookies should always have at least 1 element

As part of MB-38030 a regression was introduced causing the cookies
array to become empty and result in trying to follow a NIL pointer.
Previously we would shut down the connection for format errors, but
now we keep the connection open (and send an error message instead).
