EPBucket::flushVBucket is already too large, we should be aiming to break it up instead of making it longer.

I'm with you on that the function is large, but dedicating a EPB::commit for a single call to KVStore::commit surrounded by a stat update doesn't seem the way of keeping EPB::flushVBucket smaller.
If size is a problem, I would rather split the function in 2 parts where the first contains the initial/big block where we do the "flushOneDelOrSet" logic phase, and then a second one responsible for the disk-write logic phase.
