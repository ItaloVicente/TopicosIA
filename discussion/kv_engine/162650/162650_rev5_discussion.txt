DESCRIPTION:

MB-48688: Print clock overheads at startup & via stats

KV-Engine makes heavy use of OS-provided clocks for various timing
metrics - response-time observability tracing, histograms of how long
different phases of operations take etc.

It has been observed that under some environments (particulary
virtualised hardware and/or older OSs), the runtime overhead of
steady_clock::now() can be significant. For example, data from
MB-39618 shows that the HPET clocksource can be ~10x slower than other
clock sources.

However this can be difficult to observe in a running system without
say detailed performance profiling - the actual performance of the
clock is a function of (on Linux):

* The CPU (if it supports particular hardware features like
  'constant_tsc').

* The OS - in particular the selected
  '/sys/devices/system/clocksource/clocksource0/current_clocksource'

* Any 'hardware' platform - virtualised or real underneath.

For example, some values for current_clocksource _can_ be low-overhead
(not require a syscall) with some VM platform + hardware combinarions,
but can be slow with other combinations.

To aid in determining if a given environment has a low-overhead clock
source correctly configured, make use of the new platform function
estimateClockOverhead() to print the overhead of the two main clocks
used (steady_clock and folly::coarse_steady_clock):

1. At startup in the memcached.log
2. Via cbstats under a new "clocks" stat group, which includes:

   - clock_fine_overhead_ns : Estimate of runtime overhead to read the
     fine clock, in nanosecond.s

   - clock_coarse_overhead_ns : Estimate of runtime overhead to read
     the coarse clock, in nanoseconds.

   - clock_measurement_period_ns : The period of the base clock used
     to perfom these estimates, i.e. how accurate the above estimates
     are.

Line:15, tests/testapp/testapp_stats.cc -> I agree in general, however (a) this is in a .cc file (and a test one at that where brevity can be useful), and (b) it's pulling in a standard C++ literal suffix ("sv") which is unlikely to collide with anything else the user adds.
