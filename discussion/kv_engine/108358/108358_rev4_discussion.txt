DESCRIPTION:

MB-33952 [SR]: Allow HPS unchanged in PDM::notifyLocalPersistence

Currently we expect that the HPS always moves at persistence. But that
is wrong.

The reason is that HPS may be updated at ADM::addSyncWrite for a
Level:Majority or a Level:MajorityAndPersistOnMaster Prepare (if there
is no durability-fence preventing that). So, when the Prepare is
persisted, then it could be new-HPS=prev-HPS.
