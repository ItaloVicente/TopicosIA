DESCRIPTION:

MB-35908: Compare cas instead of seqno when deduping setVBState

The flusher currently compares the seqnos of set_vbucket_state
items to determine which is the most recent vbucket state (i.e. the
one that should be persisted). This is an issue as set_vbucket_state
operations do not update the lastBySeqno of the vBucket. This means
that subsequent set_vbucket_state items may have the same seqno.
It's not valid to udpate the lastBySeqno of the vBucket as the
replica seqnos will be different, consider setting the failover
table on DCP stream acceptance, and DCP Consumers may expect to see
a seqno that will never be sent.

Compare the CAS of the set_vbucket_state items to determine which
is the most recent instead of the seqno as the CAS will be unique.

Line:471, engines/ep/src/ep_bucket.cc -> Forgive me my question, if it has an obvious answer. I'm obviously not that familiar with the ep-engine code.

This code orders set_vbucket_state-s based on the CAS-s assigned to them when they are enqueued. Is it the case that the queue doesn't maintain the order somehow? That is, couldn't you always use the last encountered set_vbucket_state?

When the flusher runs the batch of items begin in seqno order, but then a function called optimiseWrites is invoked - this reorders the items by key then seqno, so we can apply deduplication. So the flusher end up visiting the items in seqno order, hence we have to do the > stuff.

And seqno isn't good enough for setVbState as it doesn't consume a real seqno, two state-changes (with no mutation in-between) end up with identical seqnos, hence the use of CAS

oops "So the flusher DOESN't end up visiting the items in seqno order"
