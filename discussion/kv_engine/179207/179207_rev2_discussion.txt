DESCRIPTION:

MB-51958: Simplify ReplicaEvictedBeforeActive test by using just 2 vbs

Re-enable the test too.
Intermittent failures of this test used to show up on CV and never on
local dev environments.
This first "simplification" patch doesn't fail at all, so it seems
sensible to re-enable the test and let it run on CV until/if we hit a
failure.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I don't think this fixes the failures seen in MB-51958, see https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/179214 commit message for the explanation and fix. Nice changes to add to the stack though.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> > I don't think this fixes

That's correct. In fact there's no mention to "fix" in this patch.

This test has been found quite tricky to diagnostic, so I believe that simplifying the test (if possible, and without loosing any core point of the test) should be the very first thing to address, before doing anything else.

Please recall that historically this test doesn't failing on postconditions. It fails on precondition. Meaning that if simplifying the test helps us on meeting preconditions, then that's useful and that's most of what we need.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Sure, sounds good.
Line:1153, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> populateVbsUntil calls flushAndExpelFromCheckpoints, are these calls still needed? Especially if we set checkpointMaxSize to 1.

Line:1157, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> Not needed as we're only asserting == 100% and <100%, so just >0 is fine here

Line:1164, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> Same as previous

Line:1179, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> In the ST test do we need to worry about deallocations taking the memory usage below the LWM? I believe we can move the attempToFreeMemory call to after the populateVbsUntil call and simplify the lambda.

Line:1204, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> than

Line:1153, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/item_pager_test.cc -> I don't think we need them. But I don't want to touch too much in this patch, we can remove in a dedicated one
