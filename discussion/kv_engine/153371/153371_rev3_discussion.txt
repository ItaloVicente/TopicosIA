DESCRIPTION:

MB-46046: Expose consistent histogram buckets for Prometheus

Previously, KV histogram metrics omitted buckets beyond the highest
recorded value, as these buckets would always be empty.

However, after a KV restart, Prometheus would be left with a mix of
post-restart and pre-restart values as higher buckets would not be
"overwritten" by a newly exported sample until a high enough value is
recorded.

After a (configurable) short period, these old values would become
"stale"[1], but until then queries would find inconsistent buckets,
potentially invalidating the expected cumulative nature of prometheus
histogram buckets.

To resolve this, always expose buckets covering the entire
representable range of each histogram metric.
