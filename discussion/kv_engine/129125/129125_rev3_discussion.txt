DESCRIPTION:

MB-39570: Advertise all configured SASL mechanisms

Always advertise all of the configured authentication
mechanisms even if they're not possible for all users. This
allows local users to use SCRAM-SHA (which won't work for
a user defined in LDAP).

In order to help the client provide a better error message
to the client for why the authentication failed the error
message sent back contains a boolean value if LDAP is
configured on the system or not. The client may use this
information to tell the user that it could be that the
username and password combination is correct and they
should try connecting over TLS and use PLAIN authentication
scheme.

Were we going to add a server-final message?  Where we state something like:
"Be aware not all authentication mechanisms are available to all users, when external authentication is configured"

I think that would be better to have the _clients_ add the "full" error message as they know the solution / workaround for their client.

The client could have logic like: 

    if (payload["ldap-configured"] && mech == "SCRAM-SHA*") {
        // tell the user that LDAP is configured on this system so the username/password combination
        // could be correct. you may try use TLS instead by setting XXXXXXX in the config
    }

With some explanations you could talk me into +2… see comments.
Line:348, tests/testapp/testapp_external_auth.cc -> What is this ref derived from?  In my opinion, in the ideal case, it'd be the client generated ID from HELO.  It doesn't look like that though.  I don't see that in the patch set at the moment.

Line:350, tests/testapp/testapp_external_auth.cc -> Should this be more generic?  it's not strictly LDAP, right?  There is also PAM.

Line:348, tests/testapp/testapp_external_auth.cc -> That is the reference as described in https://github.com/couchbaselabs/sdk-rfcs/blob/master/rfc/0028-enhanced_error_messages.md#description

Line:350, tests/testapp/testapp_external_auth.cc -> I could change it to "external-auth-provider-configured" : true

Line:348, tests/testapp/testapp_external_auth.cc -> Though, maybe this is the auth GUID, based on earlier work before we had a client ID?
