DESCRIPTION:

[folly] Don't write data from the background threads

Folly don't really like sending data on the socket from
other threads than the one owning the event loop (it could
probably be in the case where it would need to update the
notification status for the socket).

To work around that spool data written in other threads and
send it once we get back to the calling thread.

From running tests it _looks_ like this works differently
when using bufferevent (with locking) as data written from
the background threads gets copied into the bufferchain
and sent.

As an alternative we _could_ use runInEventBaseThreadAndWait
and send the data in stead of buffering, but it would most
likely cause a lot of context switches if the "background
thread" want to send many fragments of data.

Note that the execution pipe in the front end thread monitors
the send queue length and would stop executing commands iff
the send queue exceeds a limit. That kind of logic does not
exist as part of sending data from the background threads.

Its probably a better idea to rearrange the code so that
the background thread spool up _some_ data, signal the
cookie which gets the callback and send the spooled
data before resuming the other thread and return ewb
