DESCRIPTION:

[folly] Don't write data from the background threads

Folly don't really like sending data on the socket from
other threads than the one owning the event loop (it could
probably be in the case where it would need to update the
notification status for the socket).

To work around that spool data written in other threads and
send it once we get back to the calling thread.
