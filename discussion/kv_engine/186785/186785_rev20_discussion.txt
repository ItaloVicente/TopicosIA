DESCRIPTION:

[folly] Don't write data from the background threads

Folly don't really like sending data on the socket from
other threads than the one owning the event loop (it could
probably be in the case where it would need to update the
notification status for the socket).

To work around that spool data written in other threads and
send it once we get back to the calling thread.

It might be the case that the libevent version would block
trying to grab the event_base mutex and lock out the front
end thread while trying to send the data.

As an alternative we _could_ use runInEventBaseThreadAndWait
and send the data in stead of buffering, but it would most
likely cause a lot of context switches if the "background
thread" want to send many fragments of data.

Its probably a better idea to rearrange the code so that
the background thread spool up _some_ data, signal the
cookie which gets the callback and send the spooled
data before resuming the other thread and return ewb
