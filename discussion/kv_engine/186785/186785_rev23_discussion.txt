DESCRIPTION:

[folly] Don't write data from the background threads

Folly don't really like sending data on the socket from
other threads than the one owning the event loop (it could
probably be in the case where it would need to update the
notification status for the socket).

To work around that spool data written in other threads and
send it once we get back to the calling thread.

It might be the case that the libevent version would block
trying to grab the event_base mutex and lock out the front
end thread while trying to send the data.

As an alternative we _could_ use runInEventBaseThreadAndWait
and send the data in stead of buffering, but it would most
likely cause a lot of context switches if the "background
thread" want to send many fragments of data.

Its probably a better idea to rearrange the code so that
the background thread spool up _some_ data, signal the
cookie which gets the callback and send the spooled
data before resuming the other thread and return ewb

Patch Set 23: Code-Review-1

(4 comments)
Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> There doesn't appear to be an upper bound on how much we accumulate, which on the surface level, does not appear great.

Line:181, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> Do we not want to send/add pending writes for this overload?

Line:196, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> Nit: This could be a nice std::accumulate

Line:220, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> So if we happen to be in the event base thread, we write to the socket, but if we're not, then we queue up data.  When is this conditional going to be true. Is it possible to accumulate a really large IOBuf chain? 

A comment in the code would be very helpful (unless it's obvious).

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> We're not currently using the folly backend class for anything else than prototyping.

We need to solve this in a better way; this hack just makes sure that the range scan tests don't crash as they're trying to write data to the socket from one of the executor threads.

Line:181, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> we want to; it just wasn't used from the callstack where things crashed..

Line:196, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> probably

Line:220, daemon/connection_folly.cc -> We could be spooling until std::bad_alloc, and my _guess_ / expectations is that the code catch that "somewhere" and returns ENOMEM to the client.

That being said: As the commit message mentions we want to restructure the code in a way that it don't happens. We also need to verify that our libevent isn't currently spooling data "forever" in the background threads as well..

Line:27, /COMMIT_MSG -> Not sure where that would be... We don't currently use the folly backend and before we want to put it in production all of this would need to be resolved (in addition to the perf regression we know we have).
