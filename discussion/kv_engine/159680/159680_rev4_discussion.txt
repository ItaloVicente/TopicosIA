DESCRIPTION:

MB-47437: 1/n Update KVStore::GetCollectionStats for NotFound

Update the API so the caller can detect

Success - stats for the collection were found
NotFound - stats for the collection were not found
Failed - something went wrong

The NotFound case will be useful for MB-47437, but no callers
in this patch set are adjusted for special handling of the
NotFound case. Callers are already handling the case where
NotFound and stats are returned as 0.
