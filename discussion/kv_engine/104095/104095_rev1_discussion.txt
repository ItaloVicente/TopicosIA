DESCRIPTION:

JenkinsLogSearch: Add multiple search term support

This commit, along with some comment updates, allows multiple
search parameters to be added via the -s flag eg:
-s "foo" "bar" ...
Logs will then only be outputted if BOTH of these search terms are
present in the console logs, and instances of both terms will be
printed if formatting is supplied. This may lead to duplicates of
the same line being printed if both search terms are on the same
line, so bold formatting of the search term has been added for
log-line. Jira uses {noformat} blocks so cannot do this.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think you're better handling this by allowing the search string to be a regex - that way you get arbitrary handling of complex phrases (maybe some people want foo OR bar present) and avoid having to write all the boolean conditional checks yourself.
