DESCRIPTION:

Add prometheus configuration section

Add a new section to memcached.json to configure prometheus:

    "prometheus" : { "port" : 666, "family": "inet" }

Family may be "inet" or "inet6". The setting is currently not
dynamic as I'm not conviced it needs to be so. The communication
happens on the same node, so it shouldn't matter which address
family it use (as long as it exists on the node).

The _only_ use case I can think of where we could want to be
able to change this is if the system administrator disables the
interface on the system (I'm still not sure if it is even possible
to disable IPv4/IPv6 the loopback interface on a running system
without experiencing some sort of problems)

By making it static we can verify that we can open the port
during startup and not introduce new error scenarios we currently
don't handle (if we _fail_ to open the port due to EMFILE or the
port is used by someone else we would end up in the situation
where no stats would ever be collected from the node).

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's possible to do this (and some customers running "pure" IPv6 stacks have indeed disabled the IPv4 stack), but I believe it has to be a boot-time option.

See https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-30610 - that talks about disabling IPv6 but I believe the same logic applies if one disables IPv4.

Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> My preference for all of this was that we had a separate command one could use to enable / disable such a port (and just let the kernel pick the address family and port) and report that back to the caller. If we ever wanted to change the port one could just create a new one and delete the old one (and we wouldn't need to worry about all of the _other_ things which could fail as part of reading the new configuration).

Being two internal components on the same node we don't need to reserve a fixed port and have to deal with the case that the port is already taken by someone else. Component A should just open up a port and tell people where to connect.
