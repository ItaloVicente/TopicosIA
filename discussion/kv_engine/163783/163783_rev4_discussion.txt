DESCRIPTION:

MB-48925 1/3: Don't extend VBucket lifetime via bg Tasks

During bucket shutdown we intermittently see an exception thrown
during task scheduling on a background NonIO thread, which crashes the
memcached process.

+Analysis+

Bug is as follows. Starting at the main thread which is deleting the Bucket (Thread 1):

    (gdb) bt
    ...

    #33 0x000000000082396f in EventuallyPersistentEngine::destroyInner(bool) () at kv_engine/engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc:2135

1. PagingVisitor is still in existence running after
   `EventuallyPersistentEngine::destroyInner` - see frame #19. This is
   because all tasks belonging to bucket were returned from
   unregisterTaskable() just before.

2. PagingVisitor (via VBCBAdaptor) is destroyed, it decrements the
   refcount on the shared_ptr<VBucket> it owns - see frame #18.

3. That is the last reference to the VBucket, which results in
   VBucket::DeferredDeleter being invoked which in turn schedules a
   task to delete the VBucket (disk and memory) in the background -
   see frame #11.

We see the schedule's lambda happen on the SchedulerPool0 thread (T:35):

    Thread 35 "SchedulerPool0" hit Catchpoint 1 (exception thrown), __cxxabiv1::__cxa_throw (..., tinfo=0x10c4ec8 <typeinfo for std::out_of_range@@GLIBCXX_3.4>, ...) at /tmp/deploy/objdir/../gcc-10.2.0/libstdc++-v3/libsupc++/eh_throw.cc:80
    (gdb) bt

    ...
    #3  0x00000000005504ee in std::unordered_map<...>::at (__k=@0x7fffe83a8f88: 0x7b7400000848, this=0x7b1000005580) at /c++/10.2.0/bits/unordered_map.h:1000
    #4  FollyExecutorPool::State::scheduleTask (this=..., executor=..., pool=..., task=...) at kv_engine/executor/folly_executorpool.cc:415
    ...
    #8  folly::EventBase::runInEventBaseThreadAndWait(...) at folly/io/async/EventBase.cpp:671
    ...

In FollyExecutorPool::State::scheduleTask (frame #3) we attempt to
lookup the Taskable (Bucket) in the ExecutorPool's map, however given
its already been unregistered, the taskable is not found an the
std::out_of_range exception is thrown.

This is a lifetime issue. We have VBucket objects potentially being
kept alive longer than their expected lifetime by virtue of background
tasks having shared ownership of them - and those background tasks
outlive the lifetime of their parent object (KVBucket), and crucially
past when the owning Bucket is unregistered with the ExecutorPool and
can no longer schedule tasks.

When it then _does+ attempt to schedule a task against an unregistered
(and deleted) Taskable; we see the crash.

+Solution+

There's arguably two problems which should be addressed (although
technically only one of the two is required to encounter this crash):

1. Background tasks owning VBuckets when they are not executing.
2. Background tasks outliving their associated Taskable (aka Bucket).

This patch addresses the critical issue of (1) - we remove the
(shared) ownership of VBucket from the background tasks which
previoulsy had it - both PagingVisitor which is the problematic class
in this scenario, but also in the other background Tasks which
potentially have the same problem.

The 2nd patch will tighten up the API for visiting VBuckets, so
visitors are not passed a VBucketPtr, but instead VBucket& which
reduces the chance of similar problems happening in future.

The 3rd patch will adddress Background Taks outliving their Taskable.
