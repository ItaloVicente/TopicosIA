DESCRIPTION:

MB-49641 Add magma option to skip config validation

Perfrunner has Magma data backups. So instead of doing data loading
every time, it starts up with a backup and only runs the actual
workload. That reduces showfast test runtimes.

Sometimes we want to do a run with a certain Magma component turned off.
For example, turn off WAL and see how fast rebalance can be done (just
for understanding its impact). But since the backups were taken with
WAL=on, reopening Magma with WAL=off isn't possible due to config
validation checks.

The validation is required in non-test scenarios, for example if we
reopen Magma with WAL off, WAL replay won't run and we won't be serving
the latest data. But this is fine for performance testing. Hence the
need for this skip option.
