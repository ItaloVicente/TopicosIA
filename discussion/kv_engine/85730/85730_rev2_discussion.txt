DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Use cookie.sendResponse instead of mcbp_response_handler

mcbp_response_handler will always end up in reallocting a fresh
buffer which gets freed at the end of the transfer, whereas
cookie.sendResponse will try to use the already allocated
write buffer (which is reallocated only if the payload won't
fit in the buffer)
