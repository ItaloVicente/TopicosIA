DESCRIPTION:

MB-27533 [9]: Remove vbucket_test from ep_engine_benchmarks

This was previously included as there were tests for the defragmenter
in here, however these have since been moved into their own location.
Since vbucket_test no longer has any benchmark style tests in it,
remove it to clean up the performance testing.
