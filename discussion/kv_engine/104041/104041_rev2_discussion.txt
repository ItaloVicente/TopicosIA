DESCRIPTION:

Replace <?stream> includes with <iosfwd> where possible

In header files which only refer to types in the <?stream> headers
(such as std::stringstream, std::ostream, ...) we can avoid including
the costly full <?stream> header and instead use <iosfwd> which is
~10x smaller.

Where necessary, de-inline some functions which don't need to be
inline to allow removal of <sstream> from the header.
