DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: Generate a ModifyCollection SystemEvent

When processing a Manifest against VB::Manifest detect if the history
setting changes. When a change in history occurs update the collection
entry with the new value and generate a ModifyCollection system event.

Once the VB::Manifest write lock is dropped, the VB::Manifest will
return the new history value for all subsequent mutations (which
are ordered after the ModifyCollection event). This will in a follow
up change allow the replica to correctly process incoming mutations
against the correct history setting.

With this commit a ModifyCollection SystemEvent uses a single key per
collection. The first modification is an insert, with all subsequent
modifications generating updates. However if the CDC feature is
enabled, the complete history (for the retention period) would be
available to a DCP client, which could be useful if a DCP client
enables change_streams and flatbuffer_system_events - they could infer
the exact seqno ranges that have history enabled/disabled.

In the seqno-index a life of a collection may now become

1: CreateCollection(name=c1, history=false) <- deduplication occurs
5: Mutation(c1, k1)
7: Mutation(c1, k2)
8: ModifyCollection(name=c1, history=true) <- all versions preserved
5: Mutation(c1, k1)
7: Mutation(c1, k1)

Due to the non-unique key used for ModifyCollection, backfilling the
vbucket history does not allow the reader to infer anything about the
collections "history" configuration unless the bucket is configured to
retain all versions.

This commit only supports the ActiveReplicaManifest from
vbucket_manifest_test.cc - the new SystemEvent does not yet
transfer via DCP and cannot yet be flushed.
