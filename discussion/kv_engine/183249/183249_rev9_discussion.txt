DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: Generate a ModifyCollection SystemEvent

When processing a Manifest against VB::Manifest detect if the history
setting changes. When a change in history occurs update the collection
entry with the new value and generate a ModifyCollection system event.

Once the VB::Manifest write lock is dropped, the VB::Manifest will
return the new history value for all subsequent mutations (which
are ordered after the ModifyCollection event). This will in a follow
up change allow the replica to correctly process incoming mutations
against the correct history setting.

With this commit a ModifyCollection SystemEvent has a single key for
each collection, meaning that every change of history generates an
update, the vbucket does not store a complete view of all of the
history settings (which could be done with a unique event key).

In the seqno-index a life of a collection may now become

1: CreateCollection(name=c1, history=false)
2: Mutation(c1, k1)
3: Mutation(c1, k2) <- cannot infer anything about history
4: ModifyCollection(name=c1, history=true)
5: Mutation(c1, k1)
7: Mutation(c1, k1) <- history now preserved

Due to the non-unique key used for ModifyCollection, backfilling
the vbucket history does not allow the reader to infer anything
about the history configuration. An acceptable limitation at this
point.

This commit only supports the ActiveReplicaManifest from
vbucket_manifest_test.cc - the new SystemEvent does not yet
transfer via DCP and cannot yet be flushed.
