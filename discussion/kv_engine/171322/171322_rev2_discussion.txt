DESCRIPTION:

MB-34239: Require vbid for cbstats' durability-monitor cmd

Previously it was possible to not specify a vBucket ID to cbstats' durability-monitor, even though this behavior was not implemented.
This resulted in a 'NOT SUPPORTED with current bucket type/configuration' error. Require passing a vbid, so clitool raises 'Error: too few arguments - command expected a minimum of 1 but was passed 0: []' instead.
