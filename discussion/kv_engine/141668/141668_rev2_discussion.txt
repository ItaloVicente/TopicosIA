DESCRIPTION:

MB-41165: Modify StatChecker to be able to check post-warmup

Currently attempting to use the StatChecker and it's subclasses across
a warmup will result in a segfault as it holds a reference to the
VBucket object. I'd like to use it in this way in a future patch to
test that we have persisted new counts during compaction correctly.
Modify the StatChecker to instead take a reference to the VBucketPtr
(which the caller must reset after the warmup) to facilitate this test.
