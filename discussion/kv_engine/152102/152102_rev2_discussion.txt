DESCRIPTION:

MB-45755: Don't start flushers until VBMap populated

During warmup we flush the vBucket state to disk to ensure that
we can write to disk. If we cannot write to disk then we do not
want to enable traffic. A race condition currently exists during
warmup where a warmup thread and a flusher can attempt to flush
different vBuckets on the same shard. This can cause us to flush
items or state against the wrong vBucket or crash if we corrupt a
variable in memory as the KVStore (per shard) uses member variables
during flushing.

The simplest solution to this problem is to simply not schedule
the flusher until the PopulateVBucketMap phase of warmup has run
for the given shard. This ensures that the flusher will not attempt
to flush to the shard until after warmup is done with it.

Line:2477, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> nit: don't think runReadersUntilWarmedUp() performs any GTEST expects, is it worth us just checking at the end of the test we're in the done state of warmup?

Line:2477, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_warmup_test.cc -> Not really, we don't care about the state of the warmup after PopulateVBucketMap for this test and adding that check is extra bloat.

If we weren't in the done state then we'd have run out of memory and I don't think we'd have scheduled the tasks that would block the test teardown anyway
