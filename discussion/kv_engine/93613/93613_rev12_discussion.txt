DESCRIPTION:

MB-29441: DCP Consumer sets correct noop-interval on pre-5.0.0 Producer

In MB-19955 we decreased the noop-interval from 180 seconds to 1 second
for DCP Producers. That change is part of versions >=5.0.0.
Note that from MB-19955 a DCP Producer uses the noop-interval only for
sending NOOP messages to the Consumer. That is to implement Fast Failover.
For detecting dead connections, a post-5.0.0 Producer uses a new
idle-timeout (default value is 360 seconds).

But, on pre-5.0.0 a DCP Producer has a single noop-interval parameter
(default value is 180 seconds), which is used for both sending NOOP
messages to the Consumer and Dead Connection Detection.

When a post-5.0.0 Consumer sets the noop-interval on a pre-5.0.0
Producer (e.g., Online Upgrade with Swap Rebalance, CBSE-5179), it sends
'1 second'. Then the Producer sets 1 second as noop-interval and uses it
for Dead Connection Detection. That makes the Producer to drop all the
connections for which a NOOP response from the Consumer has not arrived
within 1 second.

To fix, we make a Consumer to check the if the Producer is a
pre-5.0.0 and to send the noop-interval accordingly (i.e., 180 seconds
if it is a pre-5.0.0 Producer, 1 second otherwise).
To check the version of the Producer, the Consumer sends a GetErrorMap
request and checks if the command is supported (the GetErrorMap command
is supported from versions >= 5.0.0).

Line:131, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> This looks unrelated to the MB; also this is only supported on MSVC - from https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html:

> PRE_BUILD
> Run before any other rules are executed within the target. This is supported only on Visual Studio 8 or later. For all other generators PRE_BUILD will be treated as PRE_LINK.

If there's an issue with generated_configuration.cc not being present; that's more likely to be due to a missing dependancy; which we should fix directly.

Line:152, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Prefer to put these in the initializer list if possible.

Line:355, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> Prefer an enums classes - not also these should only start with an uppercase letter (https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#name-types-functions-variables-and-enumerators-properly)

Line:357, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> .. "or higher" ?

Line:391, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_dcp.cc -> Name is a little bit generic (what response? when is it necessary)?

Line:131, engines/ep/CMakeLists.txt -> I'm removing this here as:
1) it does not solve (it works only on Windows as you mentioned)
2) I ll fix in a dedicated change (as you suggested)
3) I m abandoning this patch because this change has been moved from Spock to Vulcan, so I ll fix on the Vulcan build
