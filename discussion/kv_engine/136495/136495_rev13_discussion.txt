DESCRIPTION:

MB-41804: Use 'Pagable' mem_used & watermark

Ephemeral buckets cannot evict from replica vbuckets directly, but
memory used in replicas is still included in calculations determining
when the item pager should run to delete items.

Because of this, ephemeral buckets can, in certain situations (see MB)
evict all active documents from a given node, as the remaining memory
is occupied by replicas.

In this situation, with enough nodes, the bucket memory usage can
eventually reach 99% of the quota from _just_ replicas. At this point,
the node will backoff on replication. The node will then never recover
from this state - it cannot delete items from replicas, and can also no
longer stream any deletions from other nodes for the replicas.
