DESCRIPTION:

Remove Tracer::end which search for span id

The caller should keep track of the Span ID it is using and
update that when calling end. The version which took
a trace code would not work if the same trace code was
used multiple times (ex: if we got kicked off the CPU
and ended a span and wanted to start a new span with
the same code at a later time).

This seems like a bug we want an MB for (I assume this could happen without OoO if a request needed to BGfetch twice for example?)

No, because the only (current) user of that API was the core which would insert the end task of the Request (which is what spans the entire thing).

Someone _COULD_ later on use that piece of the API, and that would then "break" if it was scheduled multiple times.

Sure, but is this not the cause of the crashes we have MBs for?

Line:43, tracing/tracer.cc -> You might also want to change this to `vecSpans.at(spanId)` so it throws if an out-of-range SpanId is used.

No, it was "spotted" when looking at the code and just looks weird / bogus

Line:43, tracing/tracer.cc -> (that's unrelated to the topic of the current patch... btw. the range was checked at line 40...)

Line:43, tracing/tracer.cc -> In that case I don't really understand how this causes a memory corruption issue - yes we would close the "wrong" span but I don't see how that could cause anything to crash?

Line:43, tracing/tracer.cc -> Who said anything about a crash here??? This patch removes a logic which isn't really needed and if people later tries to use the API they end up always closing the first span which used that trace code. that's the ONLY thing this patch does

Line:43, tracing/tracer.cc -> Ah, I think I was misunderstanding - Dan mentioned earlier that we'd identified an issue with Tracing and there was a patch in flight - which is what I assumed this was. Hence my comments about MB numbers! :)
