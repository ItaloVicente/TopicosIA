DESCRIPTION:

MB-24860: CoreStore for totalMemory

Create a container class that uses get_cpu_count and get_cpu_index
from platform so that we create a per 'core' storage area. CoreStore

Use this new container for the totalMemory stat removing the use of
threadLocal and merging of threadLocal.

Now when totalMemory is read, the caller reads all of the core local
values to obtain a true total.

Line:196, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> Suspect this wants to be a CachelinePadded atomic

Overall a nice simplification!

See also comments on v4.
Line:49, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/corestore_test.cc -> one?

Line:196, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> Yeah - so interesting question on where we do the padding.

Given CoreStore is designed as a performance feature; it should probably apply the cache line padding to every element in it's vector.

That's a reasonable overhead currently, but if we move more things to be core-local (and hence make the templated type of CoreStore larger) it'll decrease.

Would be nice to add a microbenchmark, comparing to a single counter (shared across all threads).
