DESCRIPTION:

MB-24860: CoreStore for totalMemory

Create a container class that uses get_cpu_count and get_cpu_index
from platform so that we create a per 'core' storage area. CoreStore

Use this new container for the totalMemory stat removing the use of
threadLocal and merging of threadLocal.

Now when totalMemory is read, the caller reads all of the core local
values to obtain a true total.
