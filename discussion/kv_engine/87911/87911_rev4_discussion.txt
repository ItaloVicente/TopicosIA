DESCRIPTION:

MB-24860: CoreStore for totalMemory

Create a container class that uses get_cpu_count and get_cpu_index
from platform so that we create a per 'core' storage area. CoreStore

Use this new container for the totalMemory stat removing the use of
threadLocal and merging of threadLocal.

Now when totalMemory is read, the caller reads all of the core local
values to obtain a true total.

Line:53, engines/ep/src/corestore.h -> I noticed the way RocksDB uses this was to fallback to a random element if the indexing lookup failed. I don't know why it might fail (big systems which you can hot-swap CPUs?) but it might be worth considering a similar paranoid approach for safety.

Line:69, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> This might be large enough it should be moved to the .cc now?

Line:196, engines/ep/src/stats.h -> I think this can be a RelaxedAtomic given we don't use it for ordering.

Line:36, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/corestore_test.cc -> Looks like leftover debug?

Line:53, engines/ep/src/corestore.h -> Ah didn't see that, worth an update for robustness, we also have the possibility of get_cpu_index throwing because sched_get_cpu failed

The bounds check is there in-case i've messed up the relationship of get_cpu_count and get_cpu_index (certainly windows is convoluted with groups and logical procs).

Line:53, engines/ep/src/corestore.h -> Only worry I have with get_cpu_index() throwing an exception on error is *if* somehow we can't get the index; catching that exception will be likely costly. Might be better to say use an error code in this instance (again; I don't really know why it might fail but I assume they did that for a reason).
