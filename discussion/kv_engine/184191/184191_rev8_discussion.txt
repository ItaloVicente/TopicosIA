Line:2598, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> IIRC this will take a mutex in the configuration - as this isn't dynamic could possibly read it from the config once and cache it in the epe itself, similar to the usage in KVBucket

Line:194, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_synchronous_ep_engine.cc -> Is this needed?

Line:141, tests/testapp_cluster/quota_sharing_paging_test.cc -> I'd be wary of relying on a sleep - might lead to intermittent failures/tests passing but not testing the intended situation/unexpectedly slow tests if this is called frequently.

Other cases might poll until a stat changes; I suppose if there were a stat aggregator run counter this could read that stat then wait until it reaches N+1.

Alternatively, maybe it would be good enough to check _after_ the below store/remove that eviction has been triggered, there's already a pager runs stat.

That would be insufficient as lagging stats could mean the pager is not triggered where otherwise expected or triggered when it shouldn't have been.

We might need a separate stat to wait on, but even that would likely still involve a sleep, plus might not be any faster in real terms.
