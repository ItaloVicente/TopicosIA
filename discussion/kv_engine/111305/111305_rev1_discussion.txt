Line:265, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.h -> Suggest documenting the DiskSnapshot property somewhere around here and what it is used for.

Line:333, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Not sure it's a good idea to have different default values for diskCheckpoint (see Checkpoint ctor).

This function only seems to be called from a handful of places - suggest removing the default argument and having callers explicitly set it.

Line:366, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> As per previous comments, isOpenCheckpointDisk

Line:421, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> As above.

Line:442, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.h -> Ditto

Line:47, engines/ep/src/ep_types.h -> Maybe prefer CheckpointType { Disk,  Memory } - that is more explicit about what the checkpoint is if it isn't disk.
