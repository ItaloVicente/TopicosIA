DESCRIPTION:

Fix MSVC warning in WeakPtrBag

From MSVC:

    utilities\weak_ptr_bag.h(47): warning C4573: the usage of 'WeakPtrBag<ItemFreqDecayerTask,std::mutex>::compact' requires the compiler to capture 'this' but the current default capture mode does not allow it

This seems to be a known issue[1] with MSVC 2017 - it incorrectly
reports this if there's a member function with the same name as a
static method. Bug report says the issue is fixed in Visual Studio
2019 version 16.1, but in the meantime just rename the static method
to workaround it.
