DESCRIPTION:

MB-50389: Reduce fsync_after_every_n_bytes_written to 1MB

A recent change (ns_server:4b297da3a - MB-49702: Revert "MB-18426:
Reduce compaction_number_of_kv_workers from 4 to 1") increased the
maxmum number of concurrent compactors from 1 to 4. This significantly
improves the throughput of compaction, the primary motivation of which
was to allow compaction to keep up with high write workloads
(particulary with larger numbers of writer threads), to avoid running
out of disk space.

However, this had a negative impact on the tail latencies of write
workloads, as the increased amount of disk writes from compaction (4x
as many files being written) meant theere was greater pressure on the
disk subsystem.

For example, in the test analysed:

'99.9th percentile SET latency (ms), 4 nodes, 1 bucket x 20M x 1KB, 0/100 R/W, 100 threads, 2000 ops/sec, Durability Persist Majority',

the p99.9 SyncWrite latency was 3.4x slower - from 36.9ms with 1
compactor to 127ms with 4 compactors.

Address this by reducing the interval between fsync() when compacting
from every 16MB to every 1MB. For the same test this results in a
p99.9 SyncWrite latency of 17.8ms - 2.1x faster than the original,
single compactor numbers.

I also measured the impact on compaction throughput - given that more
frequent fsyncs() could reduce the overall throughput. changeing from
fsync_after_every_n_bytes_written=16MB to 1MB results in a 1.03x
increase in Compaction wall-clock runtime. This seems an acceptable
trade-off given the dramatic improvement to front-end latency;
particulary given compaction is a background operation.
