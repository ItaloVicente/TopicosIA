DESCRIPTION:

Use RAII for ConnHandler cookie reservation

When creating any of the subclasses of ConnHandler (DCPProducer or
DCPConsumer), we need to reserve the cookie (increase it's refcount)
as both these classes make use of the cookie to communicate back to
the server (for example calling notifyIOComplete, or sending
responses).

However, the previous implementation spread the required code around -
reserveCookie() was called from EventuallyPersistentEngine::dcpOpen(),
and releaseCookie() was called from
DcpConnMap::manageConnections(). Aside from being confusing, this was
also error-prone as unit tests which wished to create a DCP
producer/consumer need to remember to call reserveCookie() - many of
which didn't.

Simplify the logic using an RAII pattern - reserve the cookie in the
constructor of ConnHandler, and release it in the destructor. This also allows us to remove ConnManager::reserved and related functions, as ConnManager objects are *always* reserved if they are a valid object.
