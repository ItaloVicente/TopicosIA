DESCRIPTION:

Use RAII for ConnHandler cookie reservation

When creating any of the subclasses of ConnHandler (DCPProducer or
DCPConsumer), we need to reserve the cookie (increase it's refcount)
as both these classes make use of the cookie to communicate back to
the server (for example calling notifyIOComplete, or sending
responses).

However, the previous implementation spread the required code around -
reserveCookie() was called from EventuallyPersistentEngine::dcpOpen(),
and releaseCookie() was called from
DcpConnMap::manageConnections(). Aside from being confusing, this was
also error-prone as unit tests which wished to create a DCP
producer/consumer need to remember to call reserveCookie() - many of
which didn't.

Simplify the logic using an RAII pattern - reserve the cookie in the
constructor of ConnHandler, and release it in the destructor. This
also allows us to remove ConnManager::reserved and related functions,
as ConnManager objects are *always* reserved if they are a valid
object.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-2

Note this is failing due to a lock inversion when running under the mock server.

In normal, "production" use, cookie_reserve and cookie_release do not acquire any locks themselves - the cookie object is guarded by the overall thread lock (which is acquired at the start of the request when libevent schedules a connection to a thread). 

However in mock_server those two functions have their own lock which they acquire/release in those functions. This causes a lock inversion when DcpConnMap attempts to reserve / release the cookie when adding new connections - see below TSan report.

In terms of solving this, I can see two approaches:

1. Remove the locks from mock_cookie_{reserve,release}, making the behaviour match the production server. We probably still need locking, but it should occur before a "request" is processed. However this is likely to require significant changes to many tests...

2. Change the order of acquisition in DcpConnMap - say create the DCPProducer / Consumer not under lock; and then add to the connmap after.
One potential issue here is how we handle duplicate connections against the same cookie - at the moment we prevent even creating them as we acquire the connsLock before we check for a cookie existing; if we changed this to unconditionally create the object and only then acquire connsLock and check the map; we'd temporarily create a duplicate ConnHandler object. This may not matter, or it might (and we need code changes to deal with it).
