Line:464, daemon/buckets.cc -> If you remove const& from the signature you may just use std::move()

Line:464, daemon/buckets.cc -> Bit confused to which var your refuring to that has a const&, as name is a std::string_view and free_bucket->name is a std::string?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:464, daemon/buckets.cc -> Sorry.. I've forgotten that I've moved the piece out to a helper function. It gets called from create() which takes a const std::string. allocateBucket should take a std::string and then use std::move of the string.

Line:173, daemon/memcached.cc -> this will now create a temporary string object every time we try to associate a bucket (and for every bucket we look at). We should probably do a refactor of the signature.

Line:24, daemon/protocol/mcbp/flush_command_context.cc -> would probably be better if the signature was changed as part of the patch (instead of having to remember to go back to fix up later on).
