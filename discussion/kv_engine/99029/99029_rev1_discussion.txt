DESCRIPTION:

Convert engines to 'module' libraries (attempt 2)

The various engines are loaded as plugins via (cb)dlopen. In CMake
parlance this makes them 'module' libraries not 'shared' libraries.

Change them over to module - this shouldn't have any user-visible
effect; but allows CMake to check they are used correctly - for
example ensuring you don't try to link against a module library.

(This is a re-apply of the patch; the first version
(8a0571d167889b26f5ea6ebadae14ad937fede3c) caused Windows build-sanity
to fail - see MB-31078).

Abandoned

Not worth making the change - it requires changes to the INSTALL rule for each engine to fix the problem. and would likely need to be conditional on WIN32 (to only put the MODULE libraries in bin/ for WIN32, otherwise lib/

Given this was just a cleanup patch, doesn't seem worth the effort to continue with it.
