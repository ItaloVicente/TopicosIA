Line:90, programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc -> What's the purpose of this change? It's not moving towards the coding standard (which is camelCase).

Line:245, programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc -> Similary here - `bb` is probably less readable than `buffer_bytes` - but is no more or less in line with the coding standard - it's just adding line noise / masking the last "real" change to this code.

Line:245, programs/engine_testapp/mock_server.cc -> We've removed the validation of magic here - it that deliberate?

If so, might be worth removing it entirely as we have more thorough ways to check for memory corruption now (Asan, UBSan etc)

Line:431, programs/engine_testapp/mock_server.cc -> Style: good practice to keep this as `auto*` so the reader knows it's a raw pointer.

Line:90, programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc -> automatic fixup from clang-tidy when different namings is used in the prototype and the implementation..

Line:245, programs/engine_testapp/engine_testapp.cc -> as with the above... it is "automatically" fixed to be the same as is used where the method is implemented...

Line:245, programs/engine_testapp/mock_server.cc -> One of the changes I had to the file got lost... I replaced all of these with the "cookie_to_mock_object()" method which validated the cookie...

Line:431, programs/engine_testapp/mock_server.cc -> Done

Line:245, programs/engine_testapp/mock_server.cc -> (btw. it is also a check making sure that you provide an actual cookie, and not just a valid memory area)... we blindly cast the void pointer into something else so we should make sure to detect that it is something we expect it to be)

Line:245, programs/engine_testapp/mock_server.cc -> Note that UBSan can check that an object is of the correct dynamic type already -see https://developer.apple.com/documentation/code_diagnostics/undefined_behavior_sanitizer/dynamic_type_violation
