DESCRIPTION:

MB-54789: Ensure histogram metrics are exposed correctly for Prometheus

A regression was introduced in a change for MB-53879 which caused
histograms to be exposed as a single scalar value (specifically zero).

i.e., rather than

 kv_foobar_bucket{...}
 kv_foobar_count
 kv_foobar_sum

there would be

 kv_foobar

Restore the correct behaviour and add tests to guard.
