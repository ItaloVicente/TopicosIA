DESCRIPTION:

[SR]: HashTableStats: count Prepared SyncWrites

Record the count of how many prepared SyncWrites are present in the
HashTable. Update the datatype count stats to _not_ include prepared
SyncWrites (we don't include deleted items in datatype counts, so this
seems consistent).

Expand unit tests to test prepared counts.
