DESCRIPTION:

MB-54463: Add basic CDC test coverage for ActiveStream

By CDC enabled, DCP clients want to get all updates for a given key
from in their in-memory phase.

Given that in CM we disable deduplication by inserting multiple
revisions for the same key into different checkpoints, then DCP clients
see those updates in distinct snapshots.
