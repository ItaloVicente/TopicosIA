DESCRIPTION:

MB-54463: Add CDC test coverage for ActiveStream

By CDC enabled on a collection, DCP clients want to get all updates for
a given key from in their in-memory phase.

Given that in CM we disable deduplication by inserting multiple
revisions for the same key into different checkpoints, then DCP clients
see those updates in distinct snapshots.

Line:4984, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Style: I'd probably create some new test collections say named "unhistorical" & "historical" or similar as then it's immediately obvious to the reader when looking at the test code what the expected behaviour is (vegetable & fruit don't help the reader in this way).

Line:5000, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> .. or just use the constant value which avoids the comment (and ensures it's always in sync):

 fmt::format(R"({"collections":["{}"]})", CollectionEntry::fruit.uid)

Line:5002, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> I don't think "legacy" is a good description here - there's nothing "wrong" or "old" about a collection which doesn't have history enabled, it's simply a user choice.

Line:5015, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Style: Given you don't touch these members in this test - or even in the test fixtures' SetUp() - I wouldn't add such asserts here - they belong much higher up in the SetUp() method which actually creates them.

Line:5044, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> Style: I think checking the readyQ size on every item is unnecessary. This test isn't testing how we handle items in the ready Q itself, just that items are not de-duplicated for collections / streams which request history.

(Reminds me of the fact that tests should aim to only test the things they care about, not irrelevant things, otherwise it makes them very "brittle" and means you have to update loads of unrelated tests if you change general behaviour).

Line:5053, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.cc -> I'd also check the mutation's key here as that _is_ something relevant to this test.

Line:222, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_stream_test.h -> Style: GTest only uses / requires protected visibility for SetUp / TearDown etc methods.
