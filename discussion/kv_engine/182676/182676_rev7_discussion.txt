DESCRIPTION:

MB-54463: Add CDC test coverage for ActiveStream

By CDC enabled on a collection, DCP clients want to get all updates for
a given key from in their in-memory phase.

Given that in CM we disable deduplication by inserting multiple
revisions for the same key into different checkpoints, then DCP clients
see those updates in distinct snapshots.
