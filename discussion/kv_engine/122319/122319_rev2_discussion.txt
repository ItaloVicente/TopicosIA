DESCRIPTION:

Tighten the logic for add_conn_to_pending_io_list

Throw std::logic_error if the underlying engine tries to notify
a cookie which is already in the notified state. It should be
a 1-1 mapping between the engine returning ENGINE_EWOULDBLOCK
and notify_io_complete.

Unfortunately DCP connections work a bit different here as they
call notify_io_complete to trigger a callback because it wants
to be scheduled again to produce more data to send.
