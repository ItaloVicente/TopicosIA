I've only seen it print out success, which makes the error log looks weird

(EVUTIL_SOCKET_ERROR() just retrieves errno, and evutil_socket_error_to_string() is a strerror of that (on win32 it use the windows methods to do the same). The error may not be directly caused by the latest call setting errno....)

Well, I've added the actual raw event, and make the socket error part more explicit; so I think this is worth putting in to maybe help PV with his issue. 

If it's truly no use (and still prints "Success") in his scenario we can always revert it.

Yeah that could help to identify if it was part of sending / receiving data (or just an error as the callback may be triggered with just ERROR).

Due to the deferred logic we use for callbacks the socket error isn't really interesting as what it represent is the last function calling something that touched errno (which could be for a completely unrelated system call).

Isn't that what we've got toybuilds for ;)

I've proposed a more permanent solution in http://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/142981 (which don't insert the socket error and decodes the event into a more readable way)
