DESCRIPTION:

Add a type field to the connection

The type may be of 3 different types:

   Normal    - This is a normal client connection
   Dcp       - This is a connection where we've seen DCP Open
               but we've not seen any stream requests
   DcpActive - This is a DCP connection where the client have
               sent AddStream or StreamReq and the underlying
               engine may transmit messages as part of the
               step method.

In a later patch I'll squash Dcp and DcpActive into DCP, but
that require a lot of changes in the unit tests within ep-engine
to block sending messages before add stream is received
(otherwise we'll crash ns_server)
