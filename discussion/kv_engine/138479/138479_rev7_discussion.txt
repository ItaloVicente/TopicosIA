DESCRIPTION:

Validate onDiskPrepares pre and post compaction

In MB-41747 on_disk_prepares reach a value which is causing std::stroul
to fail parsing the value. This patch validate that on_disk_prepares
have the expected value before and after compaction runs to try to
identify when the value gets out of sync (note that the bug may still
be in the code when we don't crash as std::stroul will only fail when
the value exceed the legal range, and not if we're "slightly" out of
sync (which is just as bad))
