Patch Set 7: Code-Review-1

Line:427, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> As per later protocol_binary.h comment; with an enum class and a `using DcpOpenPayload;` directive in this function this could be made much more terse:

 const auto mark = Flags::Producer | Flags::Notifier | ...;

Line:662, include/memcached/protocol_binary.h -> Better to use a enum class (see http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Renum-set) as that makes it explicit these are part of the same set. 

If you did that it would also simplify some of the code - say if you named it:

 enum class Flags : uint32_t {
     Producer = 1,
     Notifier = 2, ...
 };

Then you could use a `using DcpOpenPayload` directive in the scope where we need to use them, and then can be referred to an a shorter form of:

 Flags::Producer | Flags::Consumer 

etc...

The problem with the suggestion is that I can't do bitwise operations on an enum. I would then have to overload all of the bitwise operations... Personally I think this moves us in the right direction, and we can move it further at a later time if we like.
Line:427, daemon/mcbp_validators.cc -> Except that I can't do bitwise operations on an enum (unless I create a ton of overloads)

Note you only need one operator (e.g. similar one defined in protocol_binary)"

    protocol_binary_subdoc_flag operator|(protocol_binary_subdoc_flag a,
                                                  protocol_binary_subdoc_flag b) {
         return protocol_binary_subdoc_flag(static_cast<uint8_t>(a) |
                                            static_cast<uint8_t>(b));
    }

However it's not a big deal; if you want to leave as-is then that's ok.
