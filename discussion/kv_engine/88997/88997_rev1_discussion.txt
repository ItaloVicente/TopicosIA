DESCRIPTION:

Expose the 'high_pri_pool_ratio' RocksDB option

In a previous patch (MB-27790) we set the
'cache_index_and_filter_blocks_with_high_priority=true' as part of the
baseline configuration to enable Partitioned Index and Filters. But, the
Index and Filters blocks is not actually enabled the 'high_pri_pool_ratio'
value is 0.0. When the high priority pool for index and filter is enabled,
the LRU-list in LRU cache will be split into two parts, one for high-pri
blocks and one for low-pri blocks. Data blocks will be inserted to the
head of low-pri pool. Index and filter blocks will be inserted to the
head of high-pri pool. If the total usage in the high-pri pool exceed
'capacity * high_pri_pool_ratio', the block at the tail of high-pri pool
will overflow to the head of low-pri pool, after which it will compete
against data blocks to stay in cache. Eviction will start from the tail
of low-pri pool.
On DGM scenarios we usually want to fill the BlockCache with (possibly)
100% of index and filter blocks, so 'high_pri_pool_ratio=1.0' and no
low-pri space for data blocks. But, if the 100% of index and filter
blocks does not fill the BlockCache, then we want to use the available
space for data blocks.
For now we expose the new 'rocksdb_block_cache_high_pri_pool_ratio'
param to teh configuration, so that we can experiment different
settings. We set 0.9 as default value for the new param (i.e., 90% of
the BlockCache allocated to the high-pri pool for index/filter blocks).
