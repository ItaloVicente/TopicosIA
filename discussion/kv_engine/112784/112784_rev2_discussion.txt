DESCRIPTION:

MB-35061: Ensure Consumer is removed from vbConns when stream is erased

DcpConsumer::{registerStream,removeStream} are complementary methods to
add a stream to the Consumer::streams map, and also add the Consumer to
the DcpConnMap.vbConns (and vice versa).

In some cases, Consumer::streams.erase() was called directly, leaving
the Consumer in the vbConns map, despite it no longer holding a
relevant stream.

Methods such as DcpConnMap::seqnoAckVBPassiveStream assume only a
single Consumer will be stored per vbucket, and use the first found.
This fails, as the "old" consumer does not have the associated stream.

Line:482, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> IIRC that's just because in the general case, erase() doesn't know what value of the mapped type to use to indicate "not found" - but for shared_ptr we can use nullptr (given we know we never insert a null shared_ptr into the map).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:172, engines/ep/src/connmap.cc -> I think it's fine perf-wise - we don't expect to have more ~100 ConnHandlers for a given vbucketId, and O(n) for that should be ok (we don't add / remove conns that often).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:482, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.h -> Why do we need the pair? Isn't a shared_ptr sufficient (null if not found; non-null if found)?
