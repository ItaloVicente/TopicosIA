DESCRIPTION:

MB-35061: Ensure Consumer is removed from vbConns when stream is erased

DcpConsumer::{registerStream,removeStream} were introduced in
http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/103845/ . They are complementary
methods to add a stream to the Consumer::streams map and add the
Consumer to the DcpConnMap.vbConns (and vice versa), keeping the two
consistent - a consumer without a (non-dead) stream for a given vb
should not be in vbConns for that vb.

In some cases, Consumer::streams.erase() was called directly, leaving
the Consumer in the vbConns map, despite it no longer holding a
relevant stream.

Methods such as DcpConnMap::seqnoAckVBPassiveStream assume only a
single Consumer will be stored per vbucket, and use the first found.
This fails, as the "old" consumer does not have the associated stream.
