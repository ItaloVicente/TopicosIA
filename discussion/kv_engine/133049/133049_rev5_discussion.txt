DESCRIPTION:

MB-40543: Add dynamic blacklist FTS log config option

Add a config option to blacklist FTS DCP logging by default by setting
the log level to critical and unregistering the logger from log level
verbosity changes. If we un-blacklist the FTS connection logger then
we set the level to that of the global logger and re-register it so
that it can change log level along with the other connections.

Line:288, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_logger_test.cc -> Worth deliberately increasing the log level in this test to say Info? I wouldn't expect much is going on here so it probably wouldn't even print anything extra to stdout...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:288, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/bucket_logger_test.cc -> Sure. I mean it doesn't really matter if this one test prints a couple of lines of logging to stdout/stderr...
