DESCRIPTION:

MB-40543: Add dynamic blacklist FTS log config option

Add a config option to blacklist FTS DCP logging by default by setting
the log level to critical and unregistering the logger from log level
verbosity changes. If we un-blacklist the FTS connection logger then
we set the level to that of the global logger and re-register it so
that it can change log level along with the other connections.

I think the approach is ok, but see comment about how problematic doing it per-bucket would be.
Line:155, engines/ep/configuration.json -> One downside of this is the user would have to set this for every bucket. It's not the end of the world but makes it more difficult to enable/disable - and I don't know if multiple bucket indexes are a thing with FTS.

Ideally we'd do this at the memcached level (similar to where `verbosity` is currently set and feed into each ep-engine instance) - but that's obviously more work.

Suggest you ask Abhinav (who's been working on the CBSE) if this would be a problem for their use-case.

Line:1919, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Might be worth pulling "eq_dcpq:fts" out into a constant given we now refer to it in two places.

Line:1921, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Isn't this the wrong way around? if newValue is true that means FTS _should_ be blacklisted?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:155, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Abhinav said they don't do anything cross bucket. FWIW epctl does have an "all buckets" options but I don't know if it works.
