DESCRIPTION:

MB-37186: EPVBucket - Mark prepare as dirty at commit

When we commit a prepare we do not mark it as dirty as we just update
the CommittedState of the StoredValue in the HashTable. If this
prepare has already been persisted then it is not dirty. If we then
commit it it is not marked as dirty so it is eligible for eviction.
If we evict it and do a get before we flush it then we will trigger a
BGFetch as the item does not exist in the HashTable. This BGFetch will
either return KEY_ENOENT (if no other committed item exists on disk) or
a stale committed item if it runs and completes before the flush of the
item in the CheckpointManager.

Correct this by marking the StoredValue as dirty when we change the
CommittedState.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Great description on what the detailed problem is. Suggest adding an initial sentence which summaries what the high level consequences of this is - i.e. loss of read-your-own write consistency.
Line:3603, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_durability_test.cc -> Could you also add a variant for the stale value case (i.e. a previous set has been written to disk, just not the current value).
