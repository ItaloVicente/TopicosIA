DESCRIPTION:

CBSE-11610: Don't try to create log directory in constructor

Don't try to create the audit log directory in the audit
configuration as we'll try to create in the audit write
thread as part of updating the configuration. An "invalid"
configuration is not fatal, it just means that we'll drop
all audit events and increment the audit_dropped counter
that ns_server provides.
