DESCRIPTION:

MB-53359: Add uniqe error code for config-bucket

Return EConfigOnly (0x0d) for clientw which enabled xerror
to indicate that the command can't be executed in a config-only
bucket.

For clients without xerror enabled we need to use one of the
initial error codes, and given that some commands may return
tmpfail (for instance when the server is low on memory) use
"Not Supported" instead.
