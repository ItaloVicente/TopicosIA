DESCRIPTION:

MB-52383: Merge branch 'mad-hatter' into cheshire-cat

* commit '5f6d5dc65':
  MB-47267 / MB-52383: Make backfill during warmup a PauseResume task

This is backport of the fix for MB-47267 (which is already present in
cheshire-cat), plus MB-52383 which fixes an issue with the initial
patch and hence actually allows warmup backfill tasks to yield
correctly.

The other changes are improvments to the the unit test for the
original issue.
