DESCRIPTION:

MB-34197 [SR]: HPS moves at snapshot boundaries in PassiveDM

In PassiveDM, the High Prepared Seqno moves by following these rules:

1) Snapshot-end received is the first point in time when any Prepare in
  the snapshot can be satisfied. So, the HPS can start moving into the
  snapshot from that time onward. No Prepare in the snapshot can be
  locally-satisfied before the complete snapshot is received.

2) At snapshot-end received, the HPS can move onto any Level Majority
  or MajorityAndPersistOnMaster Prepare up to the first durability-fence
  (ie, the fist non-persisted PersistToMajority Prepare)

3) PersistToMajority Prepares represent a durability-fence. So, at (2)
  we can satisfy Prepares only up to the durability-fence (if any).

4) At persistence the durability-fence may move.
  When the durability-fence moves, all the Prepares up to the next
  durability-fence (if any) are locally-satisfied.

5) The durability-fence can move (ie, PersistToMajority Prepares are
  locally-satisfied) only when the complete snapshot is persisted.

Note that, while the HPS may coincide with the snapshot-end seqno of a
certain snapshot, that is not true in general.
