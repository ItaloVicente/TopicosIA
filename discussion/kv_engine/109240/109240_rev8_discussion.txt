DESCRIPTION:

MB-34197 [SR]: HPS moves at snapshot boundaries in PassiveDM

In PassiveDM, the High Prepared Seqno moves by following two rules:

1) No Prepare is locally-satisfied before the complete snapshot is received
2) PersistToMajority Prepares represent a durability-fence

The two rules above imply how the HPS is updated:

a) Snapshot-end received is the first point in time when any Prepare in
  the snapshot can be satisfied. So, the HPS can start moving into the
  snapshot from that time onward.

b) At snapshot-end received, the HPS can move onto any Level Majority
  Prepare up to the first durability-fence (ie, the fist non-persisted
  PersistToMajority Prepare)

c) At persistence the durability-fence may move (ie, pending
  PersistToMajority Prepare may be persisted). In that case, the HPS
  moves onto PersistToMajority Prepare as soon as they are persisted
  (ie, we don't need to wait for the complete snapshot to be persisted
  for satisfying Level PersistToMajority)

d) Both the updates at (b) and (c) are bounded to the latest complete
  snapshot that has been received on PassiveStream. Ie, HPS can never
  move beyond that snapshot-end seqno of the latest complete snapshot
  received.

Note that, while the HPS may coincide with the snapshot-end seqno of a
certain snapshot, that is not true in general.

Only a couple of minor things...
Line:21, /COMMIT_MSG -> first

Line:165, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.h -> Can this be Montonic?

DM can be notified of snap-end received only if the snapshot contains some Prepare, unnecessary otherwise. Fixing
Line:888, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> This can be called only if the snapshot contains at least a Prepare, not necessary otherwise.
Note that this is executed in front-end threads

Line:165, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.h -> It *must*, thanks
