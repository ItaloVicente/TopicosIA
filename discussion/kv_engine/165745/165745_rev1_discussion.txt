DESCRIPTION:

MB-49037: Add ep_ht_item_memory stat

For the HT metadata we expose both the vb_{state} and the EP
aggregators, while for data (ie, items) we expose only the vb_{state}
one.

ep_ht_item_memory is the EP total allocations of items in all HTs.

The patch also renames some existing stats with a more descroptive
name:
  vb_{state}_itm_memory -> vb_{state}_ht_item_memory
  vb_{state}_itm_memory_uncompressed -> vb_{state}_ht_item_memory_uncompressed
