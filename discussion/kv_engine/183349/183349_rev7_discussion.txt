DESCRIPTION:

MB-43182: Use SIMD-enabled JSON checker

Support the new `preferVectorized` argument for the
`JSON_checkerValidator`.

The vectorised JSON checker is processes string values in JSON using
SIMD instructions. Add benchmarks for various string lengths. Also
reduced the code duplication in the benchmarks code in the process.
