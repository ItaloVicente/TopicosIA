DESCRIPTION:

MB-54340: Convert builtin and couchbase to Local domain

Audit filtering only allows to configure users by specifying
"couchbase" or "external" as the domain in the filtering
configuration. The audit daemon maps "couchbase" to local
when it reads the configuration, but some modules still
provide "builtin" (as seen in MB-54340) and I wouldn't
be surprised if someone also use couchbase.

To allow these events to be submitted and filtered allow
"builtin" and "couchbase" to be used as aliases for
"local".

Line:16, cbsasl/domain.cc -> Maybe add a brief comment explaining that while "local" is the canonical name, for backwards compat with existing components we accept builtin and couchbase also.

Line:17, cbsasl/domain.cc -> Nit: By using a std::string literal you're potentially creating heap allocations (and deallocations) for each comparison. The compiler _might_ optimise these away by hoisting as constant object it creates once; or the strings might be small enough to fit into the impl's small-string-optimisation. 

If this is performance-sensitive you'd be better with sticking with C-style string literals (no heap allocation, but does need to perform a strncmp() for equality), or even better string_view which knows its length and hence can skip the strncmp() if the lengths differ.

(In short, it's best to avoid std::string literals from C++17 upwards if they are only going to be treated as constants, string_view is strictly superior.)
