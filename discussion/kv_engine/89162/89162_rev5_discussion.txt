DESCRIPTION:

Don't use an async logger for blackhole logger

There is an issue [1] during shutdown on windows for async loggers
causing a deadlock.

There isn't much of a benefit putting the entry into a queue to
be dropped by another thread anyway ;-)

The shutdown method should drop all loggers (and clients using it
should know that one don't have any loggers calling the method.
