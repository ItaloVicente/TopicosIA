DESCRIPTION:

MB-39620: Do network reconfigure in as part of config reload

Unfortunately ns_server won't keep its commitment to implement
MB-46863 for 7.1 (and we've already merged a lot of the functionality)

Until they do we need to work around that by trying to simulate
the same actions as part of configuration reload and return
the appropriate error back to ns_server.
