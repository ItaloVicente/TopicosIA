DESCRIPTION:

Create eligibleForPageOut function

The hifi_mfu eviction algorithm needs to identify whether a
StoredValue is eligible to be pagedOut of memory without actually
paging it out.

Previously we were using the StoredValue eligibleForEviction for
eviction function however this was found not to be valid for ephemerial
buckets, as the isDirty state is always true.

Therefore we factor out the logic responsible for determining if a
StoredValue is eligible to be paged out from both the couchbase
(persistent) and ephemerial versions of the pageOut function and put it
into a new function called eligibleForPageOut.

The hifi_nfu eviction algorithm is changed to use the current vbucket's
eligibleForPageOut function.
