DESCRIPTION:

MB-34910: Warmup DurabilityMonitor

Following a restart the DurabilityMonitro should be in a logically
equivalent state to it's pre-warmup state. Of interest in this patch are
the restoration of

1. High Prepared Seqno
2. High Completed Seqno

To achieve the restoration of 1 and 2 it is simpler to track these
values as individual member variables of the ADM (the PDM is simpler).
With separate member variables warmup can now just reset these counters
to the values found in the persisted vbucket state.

Further to these changes extension of the existing warmup testing showed
that following warmup, any loaded prepares lose the 'ack' count for the
current node, all prepares found on disk must have at least an 'ack'
from the node itself. This is addressed when constructing the ADM by
calling updateHighPreparedSeqno after loading all tracked writes.

A final new piece of functionality is that the ep_vb
restoreOutstandingPreparesFromWarmup now gives the ADM a 'poke'
(checkForCommit) because some of the loaded prepares may actually be
candidates for commit, a new test demonstrates this
(DurabilityWarmupTest.WarmupCommit)
