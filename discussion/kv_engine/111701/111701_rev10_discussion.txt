DESCRIPTION:

MB-34910: Warmup DurabilityMonitor

Following a restart the DurabilityMonitor should be in a logically
equivalent state to it's pre-warmup state. Of interest in this patch are
the restoration of

1. High Prepared Seqno
2. High Completed Seqno
3. Highest Tracked Seqno

To achieve the restoration of 1 and 2 and with inclusion of the previous
patch warmup can just reset the variables to their pre-warmup values.

For the restoration of 3, that is just assigned the value of 1.

Further to these changes extension of the existing warmup testing showed
that following warmup, any loaded prepares lose the 'ack' count for the
current node, all prepares found on disk must have at least an 'ack'
from the node itself. This is addressed when constructing the ADM by
calling updateHighPreparedSeqno after loading all tracked writes.

Line:52, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> will this not be done by the other constructor anyway?
I can't see where the HPS is altered before this other than in the other constructor, but I may be being blind

Line:52, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Hmm, I actually hadn't looked at that one, but thinking more about what I've changed in the ADM, I think the PDM needs similar work, i.e. track the HPS/HCS as a separate member variable and don't derive that value from some lookup.

For example it seems that on the replica the HPS can go backwards once all tracked writes are satisfied?
