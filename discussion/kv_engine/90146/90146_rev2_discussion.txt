DESCRIPTION:

MB-27986,MB-28225,MB-27882: Remove log dedupe and flush at 200ms

This patch removes the deduplication logic from the logger as
we want to make sure that we dump (and flush) our log "immediately"
to the files. All of the log is written in a dedicated thread
which use a buffered FILE stream. We don't want to flush this
stream for _every_ log message (as that is typically 100 bytes
or so) which would cause a significant increse of file IO.

Instead we want the logger to keep writing data to the FILE
pointer, but if no log message is provided within 200ms we'll
cause FILE stream to be flushed to disk. This means that we'll
try to fill up the FILE streams buffer issue fewer actual
filesystem calls, but at the same time we won't keep the data
in those buffers hanging around for a long time.
