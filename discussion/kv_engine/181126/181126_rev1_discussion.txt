DESCRIPTION:

MB-54087: Respond only once for RangeScan error conditions

KV is sending 2 mcbp response packets to the client if a continue
is "interrupted" by a fatal error.

* vbucket changes state (no longer scannable)
* collection is dropped
* scan is cancelled by range-scan-cancel

This issue only occurs if the RangeScan is actively scanning and
detects the error. The bug occurs as the RangeScanDataHandler first
encodes the error response and then stops/cancels the RangeScan. Next
the frontend executor re-runs (ewouldblock pattern) and triggers a
second response packet.

The fix here is to ensure that for the fatal errors, the
RangeScanDataHandler does not send a response and leaves the error
response upto the frontend executor, this also ensures that the cluster
map would be properly included for not-my-vbucket errors.
