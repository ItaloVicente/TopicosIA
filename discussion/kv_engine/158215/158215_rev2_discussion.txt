DESCRIPTION:

MB-36377: Add and use MagmaTransactionContext

Add a MagmaTransactionContext TransactionContext subclass which
will now hold the pending requests queue. Remove the old
pending requests queue member from MagmaKVStore now that it is no
longer necessary.

Some tests that previously used the MockTransactionContext have
been ported to use a new MockPersistenceCallback instead as we can
no longer use the MockTransactionContext for every KVStore
implementation.

Line:1159, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> I suspect that having pcb defaulted to creating `PersistenceCallback`, while convenient for tests etc, is potentially error-prone if production code didn't create the correct EP subclass.

If we remove the default argument here, how disruptive is it across the codebase?

Line:604, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> We should probably use dynamic_cast<> here to detect any errors on the caller's behalf of passing the wrong type (the runtime cost of dynamic_cast is going to be insignificant to the rest of the work in this method),

Line:19, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.h -> Would be nice if we didn't have to pollute the header with these - can we move the definition of MagmaKVStoreTransactionContext to the .cc (and just forward-declare here)?

Line:1159, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> It's fairly disruptive, but I've made the change (which are (mostly?) in the previous patches)
