DESCRIPTION:

MB-43205: Fix return value of Item::decompress [1]

Currently Item::decompress returns:
 - true, if the value is successfully decompressed or if the item
   doesn't require inflating (ie, item not compressed, logically a NOP)
 - false, otherwise

The problem is that some callers of Item::decompress interpret that
"true" as "item was inflated", and take actions based on that. Which
would be obviously wrong in the case where Item::decompress has executed
a NOP.

Currenlty there is no bug associated with that misbehaviour as such
callers always make the call under the assumption that the item is
compressed, so their final interpretation of "true" is correct.

The next patches for fixing MB-43205 use Item::decompress and need to
distinguish between "decompressed", "decompression failed" or "nop". So,
in the follwing few patches I'll address the Item::decompress issue.

The final purpose of this small serie of patches is to move from
"bool Item::decompress" to "Inflated Item::decompress", where Inflated
encodes the 3 states mentioned above.
