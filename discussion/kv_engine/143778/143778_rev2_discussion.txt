DESCRIPTION:

MB-43205: Fix return value of Item::decompress [1]

Currently Item::decompress returns:
 - true, if the value is successfully decompressed or if the item
   doesn't require inflating (ie, item not compressed, logically a NOP)
 - false, otherwise

The problem is that some callers of Item::decompress interpret that
"true" as "item was inflated", and take actions based on that. Which
would be obviously wrong in the case where Item::decompress has executed
a NOP.

Currenlty there is no bug associated with that misbehaviour as such
callers always make the call under the assumption that the item is
compressed, so their final interpretation of "true" is correct.

The next patches for fixing MB-43205 use Item::decompress and need to
distinguish between "decompressed", "decompression failed" or "nop". So,
in the follwing few patches I'll address the Item::decompress issue.

The final purpose of this small serie of patches is to move from
"bool Item::decompress" to "Inflated Item::decompress", where Inflated
encodes the 3 states mentioned above.

In this first patch I turn the existing Inflated{No, Yes} into
Inflated{Failure, Success, Nop}. Nop is still unused here.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

I'm not sure this is necessarily the best API - we are adding quite a lot of boilerplate / additional detail which a number of use-cases might not care about.

I think something like the following would be better, using exceptions to handle the (in theory impossible) case where the document cannot be decompressed:

 /**
  * If the value is snappy-compressed, decompress it, if not
  * do nothing.
  * @throws std::runtime_error if the value _is_ marked as Snappy
  *         but cannot be decompressed.
  */
 void ensureValueDecompressed();

This has the following advantages

1. The expected case (no exception) doesn't need any extra boilerplate.
2. By renaming the function we make the post-condition more explicit - i.e. document will be decompressed regardless.
3. By not making _any_ information about the datatype available from this method, the user is forced to explicitly check the Item's datatype afterwards if they want to do anything datatype specific; which should avoid any incorrect assumptions.

Line:1068, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Similar to previous comment, this might be better solved by creating a matching 'Item::ensureValueCompressed()" method (which again returns void).

@daver
Thanks for suggestions.
Anyway, I'm not touching this further as this doesn't seem strictly necessary for MB-43205, so I'm removing that label from the title here.
Any further work on this (if any) will be under MB-43747.
