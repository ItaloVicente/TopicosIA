DESCRIPTION:

MB-54452: Keep all connections in a per-thread LRU

Update the connections position in the LRU during
command execution.

A connection is pinned to a given front end worker
thread for its entire lifetime which means we may
operate on the LRU without any sort of locking as
long as we perform the operations in the front end
thread itself.

The Connection LRU allows for finding the least
recently used connection without traversing all
connections.
