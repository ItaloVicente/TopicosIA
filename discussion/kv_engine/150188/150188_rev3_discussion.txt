DESCRIPTION:

MB-45071: Make ActiveStream::nextCheckpointItem() take DcpProducer&

Make the function take a DcpProducer& to avoid promoting the weak_ptr
to the DcpProducer if we have already promoted it.

Line:1989, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Maybe a follow-up cleanup patch to pass DcpProducer& into transitionState() ? ;)

Line:1989, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> I don't think that that is going to be possible actually. There's a couple of cases where we call transitionState via endStream from background threads and we may have already destroyed the producer. I don't know if it matters in that case if we even call endStream/transitionState (I'm leaning towards it not mattering), but I don't want to break something like that this close to a release. I'll see if I can tidy it up nicely, but might want to defer that change.

Line:1989, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Makes sense. 

We can certainly put that kind of change in post- branching, gives us a long runway to find and fix any issues arising
