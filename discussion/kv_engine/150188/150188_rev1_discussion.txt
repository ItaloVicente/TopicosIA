DESCRIPTION:

MB-45071: Add ActiveStream::nextCheckpointItem(DcpProducer&) variant

Add a variant of the function taking a DcpProducer& to avoid
promoting the weak_ptr to the DcpProducer. Two callers (other than
a mock) still use the old variant that promotes the weak_ptr but
they are both in the transitionState function that will not be
called often.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> If there's only two callers I'd suggest changing them to acquire the  DcpProducer, then you can remove the old variant.

Line:1000, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Strictly speaking this is a behaviour change - previously if producer was null, but vbucket had no items ready and chkptItemsExtractionInProgress was true, this function would return `true` - see line 1008. Now it returns false.

I don't know if the difference matters or not, but if you haven't already can you trace through and check if this is a problem.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:1000, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Addressed the other comment and the one case with modified behaviour is in transitionState. If we couldn't promote the producerPtr then we'd skip calling notifyStreamReady. We woudln't try to notify the producer in this case as it doesn't exist anyway, but we wouldn't set itemsReady to true. I don't think this makes any difference as the only thing checking itemsReady is notifyStreamReady which wouldn't notify the producer as it doesn't exist.
