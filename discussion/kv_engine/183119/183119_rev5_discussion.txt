DESCRIPTION:

MB-54666: Introduce the change_streams DCP_CONTROL key

- DCP Producer disables CDC by default
- DCP Producer accepts the new key and enables CDC accordingly on the
  connection. Generic DCP Clients covered by that.
- DCP Consumer tries to enable CDC by default. 7.2.0 Consumers always
  send the new control key to the Producer for enabling CDC on replica
  DCP connections.
- DCP Consumer is resilient to pre-7.2.0 nodes. In case of non-success
  at DCP_CONTROL (as returned by legacy Producers that don't know about
  change_streams) CDC is set disabled at Consumer.

Notes:
- The CDC setup is a blocking step. The Consumer won't start operating
  until the setup is complete.
- Consumer needs to know about CDC enabled/disabled on the connection
  for enforing the proper validation on snapshots received.
