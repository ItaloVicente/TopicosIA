DESCRIPTION:

MB-00000: Introduce the change_streams DCP_CONTROL key

- DCP Producer disables CDC by default
- DCP Producer accepts the new key and enables CDC accordingly on the
  connection. Generic DCP Clients covered by that.
- DCP Consumer tries to enable CDC by default. 7.2.0 Consumers always
  send the new control key to the Producer for enabling CDC on replica
  DCP connections.
- DCP Consumer is resilient to pre-7.2.0 nodes. In case of non-success
  at DCP_CONTROL (as returned by legacy Producers that don't know about
  change_streams) CDC is set disabled at Consumer.

Notes:
- The CDC setup is a blocking step. The Consumer won't start operating
  until the setup is complete.
- Consumer needs to know about CDC enabled/disabled on the connection
  for enforing the proper validation on snapshots received.

Line:398, engines/ep/src/connhandler.h -> this one atomic but line 395 isn't?

Line:1693, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> I'd recommened moving this to dcp-types as Producer/Consumer need to know  this string

Line:1109, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> when moved to dcp-types you can just refer to the value defined in the header

Yeah that was the intention, I've missed it, done.

Line:398, engines/ep/src/connhandler.h -> This one's atomic as it's going to be included in stats, so we have concurrent access on it.
Not sure about the other, we might have a race on that.

Line:1693, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Done

Line:1109, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Done
