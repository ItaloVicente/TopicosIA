DESCRIPTION:

MB-23622: Use smart pointers for DCP Stream::readyQ

DCP Stream::readyQ was using raw pointers.
As first patch I just covered the basis (funtions of Stream
still get in input and return DcpResponse* raw pointers).
The biggest change in this patch is that Stream::popFromReadyQ()
now returns 'DcpResponse*' rather than 'void'.

Hope this makes sense
Line:169, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> So ultimatley this change should be about removing the need for manual deletion of objects, if we get the ownership correct, unique_ptr will do the work for us at the right time.

Here we decompose the smart pointer into a raw pointer, transferring ownership (delete responsibility) to the caller, but this raw pointer now travels up the return chain and finally gets deleted here http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/trunk/kv_engine/engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc#644

So if we get the pointer ownership right, the delete at producer.cc:644 should be redundant.

We should look to making popFromReadyQ return a smart pointer owning the DcpResponse, the producer code will then be forced to use smart pointers too and the delete will become redundant.

Line:855, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> As Jim said, consider transferring the smart ptr ownership till DCP producer where the resp obj finally gets deleted.
That is, you return the std::unique_ptr<DcpResponse> and will use 'move' semantics to transfer the ownership of the resp obj

Line:857, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Cool, not -2 anymore.

Also note that address sanitizer is detecting some memory leaks
