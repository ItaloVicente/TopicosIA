Are you using git-clang-format ?
Line:621, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Exceeds 80 chars

Line:648, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Exceeds 80 chars

Line:493, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> is std::move(rejectResp) enough ? shouldn't we also do rejectResp.reset() ?

Line:546, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Exceeds 80 chars

Line:453, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> exceeds 80 chars

Line:579, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Exceeds 80 chars

Line:511, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> 80 chars again

Mostly looks good; few style & formatting suggestions.
Line:616, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Recommend you don't change things like the '*' positioning on existing code which you haven't touched - it just creates noise in the patch and breaks git blame.

Note if you use git-clang-format (or JamesH's git commit hook - see http://hub.internal.couchbase.com/confluence/display/cbeng/Using+the+git+clang-format+pre-commit+hook) then it'll automatically fix things as appropriate.

Line:648, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Again, I don't think you otherwise touched this line - please revert back to it's original form.

Line:493, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> std::move is sufficient - by definition it'll move from rejectResp, leaving it with a null value. See http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr/operator%3D case (1).

Line:159, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> This code is redundant now, you can just delete it.

Line:192, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Style: Prefer to not use else after `return` - see https://github.com/couchbase/memcached/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#don-t-use-else-after-a-return

Line:336, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Prefer to just default-construct the unique_ptr - the `nullptr` argument is redundant.

Line:173, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> Style: Given you the caller doesn't need to know this is a unique_ptr (it's just examining an object and not modifying it), prefer to use a const raw pointer. See  http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rr-smartptrparam

Line:338, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> As above - can be changed to a const raw ptr.

Line:493, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> We do not need to call rejectResp.reset() because after std::move(rejectResp) rejectResp holds nullptr.
