DESCRIPTION:

MB-23622: Use smart pointers for DCP Stream::readyQ

DCP Stream::readyQ was using raw pointers.
As first patch I just covered the basis (funtions of Stream
still get in input and return DcpResponse* raw pointers).
The bigger change in this patch is that Stream::popFromReadyQ()
now returns 'DcpResponse*' rather than 'void'.

Line:169, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> The '*' needs to be closer to the type.

Line:191, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Please remove the extra spaces

Line:2448, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Can't we just do return popFromReadyQ()?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> This should be part of a separate commit.
1st commit only changes to smart ptrs
2nd commit, if needed, changes the return type of the pop. I mean 'if needed' because I dont see a reason why pop should return

Line:165, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> If you choose to return in popFromReadyQ(), return the ptr of owning type.
That is return std::unique_ptr<DcpResponse>

Line:169, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> i) You should not use .release() if you want the raw pointer. You must use .get().
ii) I don't get why, do you need a raw pointer ?

Line:857, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> popFromReadyQ() should not be used here. In the next if we do not go inside the 'if' condition, then we still want the response in the readyQ.
This is a -2

Overall pretty good first patch. Had to give -2 only due to that subtle logic error

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I wrote a comment about Stream::popFromReadyQ() returning DcpResponse* directly on code.

Line:165, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> The reason for returning DcpResponse* here is the kind of situation below in PassiveStream::next():

    DcpResponse* response = readyQ.front();
    popFromReadyQ();
    return response;

Now, there we should change to `DcpResponse* response = readyQ.front().release();` because if we use get() then the raw pointer is deleted when we `readyQ.pop()` here at line 174. But, if we use release() then we dereference nullptr at line 170.

So, I considered the possibility to remove the need of the double step "readyQ.front() + popFromReadyQ()" from code that calls popFromReadyQ().

Also, I thought to delegate a 2nd patch for amending functions signature and return type to std::unique_ptr<DcpResponse>.

Line:169, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Done

Line:169, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> i) I needed to use release() here to release the ownership of the managed raw pointer because we delete the same raw pointer somewhere else (DcpProducer::step()). If I use get() here, memory is freed the first time below at line 174 with readyQ.pop(), and then again in DcpProducer::step() leading to SegFault.

ii) I need a raw pointer just for returning. I considered to change functions signature and return type in a 2nd patch.

Line:191, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Done

Line:857, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Done

Line:2448, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Sorry for this :) Done
