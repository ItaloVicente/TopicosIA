DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: EPBucket::FlushResult to use less memory

Refactor struct EPBucket::FlushResult, to use 16 bytes from 24 bytes by
moving `size_t numFlushed` to be the last member of the struct so
moreAvailable and wakeupCkptRemover can be packed into 8 bits.

This isn't an incorrect change, but I'd question the cost/benefit of such a patch. FlushResult is only ever used as the result of flush() and as such just lives on the stack; and will be quickly discarded. All you actually achieve by reducing it's size from 24Bytes to 16 is you change the amount the stack increases by 8 bytes (shortly before it's decremented again).

Object size can be a useful thing to optimize, but generally only if the object is very large, or there's many (millions) of instances such that the actual size decrease has a significant impact on overall memory usage.

Completely agree, Jim happened to point it out when doing a code review for my set vbucket patch. Though now we're not doing the refactor in that patch, I was just of the option why not just do it given its two lines and was on my mind.

Happy to abandon if you feel it's necessary chern of code

You've already raised the patch etc, so there's no harm to put it in now, but I'd advise leaving such things in the future - consider the opportunity cost - there's no shortage of other things to fix in the code!
