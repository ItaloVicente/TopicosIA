DESCRIPTION:

MB-52580: Add test to verify keyIndex allocators are disjoint

Prior to standardizing with the manual allocators by removing the
keyIndexKeyAllocator and integrating its value with keyIndexKey, add a
test to record that they are disjoint.

Line:3917, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Apologies, I though I had posted a comment on this too before.
So this is correct, but same as the "bound" above, here we expect this alloc to be much smaller than keySize. Can we make that stricter? Eg:

EXPECT_LT(checkpoint.getKeyIndexAllocatorBytes(), 64);

My point is that here we actually expect just a few bytes allocated, ie we are closer to 0 than keySize. I've picked 64 just as an example, I m sure that you have some more sensible value thanks to all your debugging in this area
