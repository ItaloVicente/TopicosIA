DESCRIPTION:

MB-52580: Add test to verify keyIndex allocators are disjoint

Prior to standardizing with the manual allocators by removing the
keyIndexKeyAllocator and integrating its value with keyIndexKey, add a
test to record that they are disjoint.

Line:3890, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> So I think this is a case where moving constants to a different location actually /hinders/ the readability of the code.

Right now we have a comment (here) which nicely describes why you are performing the check below, mentioning a small error margin of 5% is chosen - fine and reasonable... except the actual value for "scalarBound" is elsewhere in a different file, which the reader either has to take on trust actually is 5%, or has to flip over to a different file to see what the scalarContext actually is.

Given you only use this constant in this one place, it's actually clearer if you just leave the 5% value here.

Line:3926, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> So your use of expectReasonableAllocatorValues() isn't very valuable here - as per your comment the memory allocated to the keyIndex should be unchanged from the memory before line 3925, but you are not actually verifying that. 

I would suggest storing the value of checkpoint.getKeyIndexKeyAllocatorBytes() in a variable before calling expelItems, and EXPECTing that it is unchanged.

I would also suggest looking at removing the element from keyIndex, and confirming memory goes to zero as expected.

Line:147, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.h -> Pulling the contestants out into the class is a good idea.

Could still do with some details on what 'smallOverAllocBytes' and `scalarBound` mean - and the reasons for choosing their values.

Someone not familiar with the details of the CheckpointKeyIndex / folly containers wouldn't know why these values were chosen.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:3926, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Sure. On the last part, considering this test is at the checkpoint level not the keyIndex level, it would make more sense to add that to https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/177069/2.

Currently that patch doesn't remove them, because the keyIndex never removes keys during the life of a Checkpoint, even when the item is expelled. But it is probably worth testing it for completeness in that patch anyway.
