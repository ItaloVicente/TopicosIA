Sorry for the stealth review, just saw this from the background thread patch.
Line:65, daemon/alloc_hooks_jemalloc.cc -> Can you provide some numbers for the effect of this before we merge into the mainline?

Also did you experiment with the `auto` option which apparently only uses THP for metadata when it gets large enough? (Might be better for smaller buckets)

Additionally, I think it's also worth testing the `thp` option to use THP for the actual memory allocations. Note that to make this work you'll need to ensure that the OS-level THP setting is set to `madvise` - currently we recommend people set it to `never` so some extra work on the perf machines etc is probably needed.

Line:65, daemon/alloc_hooks_jemalloc.cc -> That's the plan, will test both always and auto and look into thp option. Just had to rebase
