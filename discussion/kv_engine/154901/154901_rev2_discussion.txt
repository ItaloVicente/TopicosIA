DESCRIPTION:

MB-39620: Only write interface file once [3.1/3]

To work around all sharing problems with the interface file
it should _only_ be written once and contain the bootstrap
interfaces.

If you want to look at the current configuration you can always
connect to the bootstrap interface and run "ifconfig list"
