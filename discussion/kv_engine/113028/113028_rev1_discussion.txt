DESCRIPTION:

MB-35133: Cleanup old SyncWrite rollback code

Previously we attempted to rollback SyncWrites individually
by setting the correct state in the HashTable and PDM
post-rollback. With the new, simpler, approach to rollback where
we re-use the warmup code to load prepares we can remove the code
added to pass various state through to the PDM and the PDM rollback
function.
