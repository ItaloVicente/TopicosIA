DESCRIPTION:

MB-26255[5]: Process the final DCP item at response creation time

The item that is received from a backfill or from the checkpoint,
isn't the final item that is sent over the wire to the DCP consumer.
The item's value/xattrs is pruned or the value is compressed or
decompressed. So, before creating the final DCP response, create the
final item and store it in the response.
