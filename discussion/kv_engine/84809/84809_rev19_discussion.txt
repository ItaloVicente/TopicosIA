DESCRIPTION:

MB-26255[5]: Process the final DCP item at response creation time

The item that is received from a backfill or from the checkpoint,
isn't the final item that is sent over the wire to the DCP consumer.
The item's value/xattrs is pruned or the value is compressed or
decompressed. So, before creating the final DCP response, create the
final item and store it in the response.

DaveR,

Please note that with this change if the client has enabled compression, all the items that have been placed in the ready queue will be streamed as compressed even if the client disables compression. In essence, the new setting only gets reflected if all items from the ready queue has been streamed.

I think that's fair, given the full-duplex (async) nature of DCP once it's setup. 

Couple of things:

1. We should document that in the code.
2. I'd be tempted to simplify this, and not allow compression to be disabled once started - or alternatively, when a stream is created we take the value of compression on/off and simply use that for the duration of the stream. If the client wants to change that stream, they need to close the stream and re-open it.
