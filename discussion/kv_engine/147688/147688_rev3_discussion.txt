Line:198, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> I would add the "full" state (on a single line if possible):
 . PDM::state::HPS
 . PDM::state::HCS
 . PDM::state::trackedWrites.size()
 . PDM::state::receivedSnapshotEnds
 . PDM::state::droppedCollections

Line:198, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> +
 . PDM::seqnoToAck

Line:91, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Same for ADM:
 . ADM::state::trackedWrites.size()
 . firstChain
 . secondChain
 . HPS
 . HCS
 . lastTrackedSeqno
 . lastCommittedSeqno
 . lastAbortedSeqno
 . queuedSeqnoAcks

I would also add the resolvedQueue.size() but it seems that we don't have an API for that :(

Line:198, engines/ep/src/durability/active_durability_monitor.cc -> I added trackedWrites.size() and highestTracked. I don't think that we should add the other state here as they're not used in the transition to ADM

Line:91, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Again, I added trackedWrites.size() and highestTracked (HCS and HPS already there) here but I think that adding the rest is of questionable value and adds more noise to the logs

Line:91, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Well everything is of questionable value until you hit some issue where you realize that you need something. Eg, the last* stats where useful in recent ephe issues where a "last completed" was missing in the current snapshot etc..

Line:91, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> Here we are logging only at vbstate changes (so we don't really risk to blow logs by this, even because the extra logging would be a few characters) and deciding to omit information that has already been found useful for solving a bug that took 1 month for getting to the RCA. I wouldn't call that reasonable :)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:91, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.cc -> I think what Ben has is a reasonable balance.

Note we have a finite amount of logging capacity, one big problem with logging too much detail is we end up limited history when things _do_ go wrong, and have _no_ information about the important thing which happened 2 hours ago...
