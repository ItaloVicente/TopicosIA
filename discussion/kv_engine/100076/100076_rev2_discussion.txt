DESCRIPTION:

Clear the packet after we've used it

Cookie::toJSON tries to add the packet currently in use
to the JSON dump which is included in the dump of the
connection. This is however not "safe" as we've consumed
the bytes from the input buffer, and we could in theory
resize the buffer and use a dangling pointer.

This isn't currently a problem (as we won't resize the
buffer until we've read the header, and then we reset
the cookie), but when using bufferevents we don't have
that control over when the underlying buffer gets reset
once we've told it that we're done with memory.
