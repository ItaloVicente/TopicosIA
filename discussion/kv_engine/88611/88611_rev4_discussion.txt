DESCRIPTION:

MB-24860: Rename getTotalMemUsed to getEstimatedTotalMemoryUsed

The name better suits what the function returns, the value may read
more or less than the real amount allocation (with that +/-
controlled by the mem_used_merge_threshold_percent).

Report the precise value in mem_used (that is effectively what used
to happen before the original TLS mem_used tracking)

Also report the estimated value to assist with debugging (estimated
is used for paging trigger etc...).

Change-Id: I7f82775b2bab9de9a25064dc7ea8660555653792

Line:2548, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> Nit: Might be nice to use "estimate" as a suffix, so we see these two values next to each other in mortimer / stats.log.

Line:2923, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.cc -> We should make sure this uses the same value as mem_used via "all" - i.e. precise.
