DESCRIPTION:

MB-36373: Refactor evp_store unit tests

The evp_store unit tests currently run only for couchstore, and some
combination of eviction policies. Refactor this test suite to use (where
possible) the STParameterizedBucketTest fixture so that we can run the
tests for non-couchstore backends.

Some tests have their own parametrization including bloom filters. Add
a new testsuite for these as GTest does not allow you to have multiple
hierarchies. Alternatively we could add a bloom filter on/off to the
fullEviction flag and re-use the STParameterizedBucketTest.

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> tiny nit parameterization

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> :feelsbadman:

Line:55, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.h -> One (bad) thought I had last time round was to GTest parameterize over (pointers to) some Config type, and use inheritance to add new dimensions.

Gross, I know.

I had a vague wonder about templating _all_ the test classes over an argpack which was shoved into the testing::tuple at the end so subclasses could instantiate their parent type over "more" parameters than the parent knows about.

Even grosser, yes. Also probably the road to madness/4 day compile time.

:sadpanda: all round

Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> does indeed

Line:55, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_test.h -> Gross indeed. Thought about messing with their typed tests but you have to manually specify which tests run as part of suite which sucks.
