DESCRIPTION:

MB-28206: Stop 'get_meta' from affecting 'get' stats

When getMeta was moved into memcached, we introduced behaviour which
meant that these operations were being included in the regular get stats
however, this caused these operations to be counted twice in ns_server
and so the data shown to the user was higher then reported (seen when
using XDCR). As this behaviour is not currently replicated by setMeta,
stop this from happening to A) maintain consistency and B) stop the
incorrect reporting of the get operations count.

Line:40, tests/testapp/testapp_stats.cc -> You could actually keep a variant of this as a negative test - perform the ops and check that none of the cmd_get stats change.
