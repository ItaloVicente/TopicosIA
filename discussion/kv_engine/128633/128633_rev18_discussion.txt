DESCRIPTION:

MB-39046: Introduce units for statistics

While many existing stats represent a value with units (e.g.,
microseconds), this was not always programatically determinable.

In order to correctly expose stats for Prometheus, stats need to be
scaled to base units (microseconds->seconds, kilobytes->bytes) and
appropriately suffixed ( https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/
).

This patch introduces Unit types which can be used to normalise values
and determine the correct suffix.

Units are not yet used in this patch, but will in future be used in
metric definitions.

Line:273, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> Are we going to have any issues with float / double rounding here?

Line:284, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> Is "percent" a prometheus thing? I'm not really a fan of having something called "percent" which is in the range 0.0-1.0 - that's just wrong - "percent" is in the range 0-100!

Can we just stick with using "ratio" in our code as that at least has a fixed meaning?

Line:3, include/statistics/stat_units.h -> 2020 ?

Line:33, include/statistics/stat_units.h -> Nit: You're allowed to add a trailing comma to the last enum element now (since C++14?), which means if another element is later added you don't have to modify (and break blame) of the previous ultimate element.

Line:36, include/statistics/stat_units.h -> Please add a description of this class.

Line:70, include/statistics/stat_units.h -> You probably want a folly::unreachable() here.

Line:273, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> I'd be surprised if we _didn't_ have rounding issues really. Apparently this value happens to be correctly representable - the test passes with these values, but can easily be made not to by using smaller numbers

 Expected equality of these values:
  0.000000000456
    Which is: 4.56e-10
  units::nanoseconds.normalise(0.456)
    Which is: 4.56e-10

I can make it EXPECT_NEAR, if preferred.

If you meant actually in Prometheus, we either:

1. accept that stats will be retained as a double representing the recommended base units (seconds, bytes, ratio, celcius etc.) with any rounding and limitations that entails
2. expose stats in non-base units to make sure the values are in a good representable range, and handle the querying hell that will cause

Line:284, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> This time I think I've got percent and ratio the right way round - the unit "percent" is to used when the value kv tracks is a 0-100 (or higher) percentage, to then be normalised into a ratio 0.0-1.0 to expose to Prometheus. That is, the unit describes what the number kv works with _is_ (and thus the unit cbstats uses... in most cases), not what prometheus will see.

It doesn't normalise _to_ a percentage, it normalises _from_ a percentage, to the matching base unit Prometheus expects: a ratio. Compare to a stat which goes up in "days". This may be internally tracked in kv as say an int `3`. By associating it with the unit `units::days`, the exporter now knows how to scale `3` to get the number of seconds for Prometheus, 259200. If we in the future want to track hours, we change the code that generates that stat so it stores `72` instead, but change the unit to `units::hours`. Now, Prometheus _still_ knows how to get the correct number of seconds.

To get back to percent: ep_mem_low_wat_percent is tracked internally as a real percentage 0-100 (and cbstats exposes that value as-is), but needs to be exposed as a ratio for Prometheus. So, in the process of collecting and exposing, it is normalised

 units::percent.normalise(95) == 0.95

so Prometheus will get it in the format meeting the best practices.

In any case, it's not immediately clear so that says "needs documentation!" to me.

Perhaps normalise is a bit vague anyway. maybe "toBaseUnit" or something.

Ideally, I'd like it to be more like std::chrono::duration in operation

 std::duration_cast<std::chrono::seconds>(<whatever value the stat returns in whatever time unit it likes>);

so maybe (again, this is not what the code does now, but _could maybe_ do)
 
 units::megabytes getSomeStat();

Then to turn it into the desired base unit, one could do something like

 units::bytes(getSomeStat()).count();
or
 unit_cast<units::bytes>(getSomeStat()).count();

or whatever.

Functionally the maths that needs to be done is the same, but that might fit better with the mental model of units. That way, the same benefits std::chrono::duration brings to time could be brought to bytes and ratios.

But it's not there yet. For now, this is a bolt-on to declare in the X-macros the unit we _currently_ track stats in.

Apologies for the brain-dump

Line:3, include/statistics/stat_units.h -> Dang, I set the time machine to the wrong decade. Done!

Line:33, include/statistics/stat_units.h -> Done, much nicer

Line:36, include/statistics/stat_units.h -> Done

Line:70, include/statistics/stat_units.h -> Done

Line:273, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> I was talking about the test in this instance. For the kind of things we use stats for, I think prometheus' representation should be fine.

Suggest EXPECT_NEAR for these tests.

Line:284, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/stats_test.cc -> I think it follow ;)

I noted the std::chrono -style approach - which I think is quite nice. `toBaseUnit()` or similar seems more descriptive - "normalise" is somewhat vague.

In terms of ratio vs. percentage, as long as we talk about things which are percentages (x/y *100) as "percent" and ratios (x/y) as "ratio" I'm happy :)
