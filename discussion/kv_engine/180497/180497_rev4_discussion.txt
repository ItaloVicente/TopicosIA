DESCRIPTION:

MB-53806: Backfill-yield doesn't update ScanContext::lastReadSeqno

The DiskCallback at backfill yields *before* processing the item.
So, setting (lastReadSeqno = item's seqno) means effectively skipping
the item at backfill resumed, as the backfill will resume at
lastReadSeqno + 1.

Misbehaviour introduced at
https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/179955.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think it's better to just make them all behave the same - i.e. always process the item before yielding. Having different semantics for different callbacks (the processed flag) is likely to lead to bugs.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> That means changing DCP - Perfectly doable but wider change.
The other way is to change back warmup to processing the item after yielding. From reviewing your warmup change I see that inverting the process/yield order is a core part of your change, is it?

This is a test blocker for Perf, that's why I aimed to keep the 2 different behaviours at backfill/warmup.

I dislike the process flag too. Maybe we can introduce a Callback::yieldAndSetProcessed() API ? At least by that the semantic is clear from the user perspective.

With Warmup we yield based on time (i.e. every X ms). For some disk environments we see that even for the first item fetched, we have already exceeded the time slice. The original code yielded without actually processing the item just read, which meant we failed to ever make forward progress,

I would have thought it would be reasonably straightforward to just move the code which checks when to yield in DCP after we have processed the item, like warmup?

It's the unexpected and immediately-not-visible side effects that usually give me concern on DCP ;) I'm giving it a try 👍

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Local patch makes the change, all good on the BySeqnoScan side.
But, hitting a blocker in the ByIdScan area.

When we yield, ByIdScan needs to save the key from which we have to resume at the next run.

In the current code base we yield BEFORE processing the key, so we do startKey=lastReadKey, as lastReadKey wasn't processed. All fine there.

Now, if we change to yielding AFTER processing lastReadKey, then we don't know what's the next key to resume from, as that next key is determined by the ById index walk within the storage.

We don't have that problem in the BySeqnoScan as we just resume from lastReadSeqno+1

I suggest looking at what Jim did for key ranges for range scans. You essentially want to set the next key to be "current_key + 0x1" or similar.
