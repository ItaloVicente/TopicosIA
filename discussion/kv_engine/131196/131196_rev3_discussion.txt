DESCRIPTION:

chunk based leb128 decoder - note not default method in this patch.

The version now in this patch benchmarks a little better for all
cases, 20 to 25%?

I have fixed a few bugs but it means there's quite a few variables
to track for correctness.

* how far through the input buffer we are
* how far through each chunk

In the bench-mark yay, but need to now benchmark mcbp_validators
as I re-call the loop version being better there as it inlined
whereas the compiler wouldn't inline the chunk version

Hmm now with all fixes and larger input set, not much better

A specialise u32 version is possible, but only a tiny bit better
