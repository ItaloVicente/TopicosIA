DESCRIPTION:

MB-35297: RangeScan continue using mcbp

Add mcbp validator/executor so that an existing RangeScan can be
continued.

A RangeScan continue is a bit different to other mcbp commands.

1) A single continue request may trigger many response packets, with
each response carrying a payload containing many keys/values.
See range_scan_continue.md for a description of the payload format.

2) The RangeScan I/O task (AUXIO) is writing 'directly' to the
connection. This is different to the usual ewould_block pattern
as we don't bring data into memory and then trigger a worker thread
to copy that memory out. Note that the continue request does not
use out-of-order and the connection cannot process any more commands,
even whilst waiting for the AUXIO task to pickup the continue task.

Patch Set 9: Code-Review-1

(6 comments)
Line:23, /COMMIT_MSG -> Might be worth explaining why this is the case - just an initial simplification or is there something fundamental with RangeScan which means OoO cannot be used?

Line:125, docs/range_scans/range_scan_continue.md -> Perhaps choose an example length which means leb128 encoding doesn't map to simple integer count (>127?) - so it's more obvious in the hexdump below how the length is encoded?

Line:149, docs/range_scans/range_scan_continue.md -> Possibly discussed before (and maybe I forgot the conclusion), but do we gain enough from packing multiple documents (including their key, CAS, flags etc) into a single response to outweigh the complexity of another way to send values over the wire?

For example, to encode two documents (key0 and key1) with their various metadata and value would take:

   24B (header)
 + 25B (flags, expiry, seqno, CAS, datatype)
 +  1B (key0 length prefix)
 +  4B (key0)
 +  1B (value length)
 +  6B (value0)
 + 25B (flags, expiry, seqno, CAS, datatype)
 +  1B (key1 length prefix)
 +  4B (key1)
 +  1B (value length)
 +  6B (value1)
 = 91B
 
Encoding the same as two response packets, with the standard 24B header (which already includes key length, value length, datatype and CAS) gives:

   24B (header 1 - includes CAS, keylen, bodylen, datatype)
 + 16B (flags, expiry, seqno)
 + 4B (key0)
 + 6B (value0)
 + 24B (header 2 - includes CAS, keylen, bodylen, datatype)
 + 16B (flags, expiry, seqno)
 + 4B (key1)
 + 6B (value1)
 = 100B

That's an extra ~9% if we used framing similar to current GET, at arguably a very minimal value size. If the value sizes were instead 100B (which still feels small for most real-world documents) then the above totals become 279B and 288B, or only 0.3% smaller with the single-header approach.

Note that _if_ the value size goes over 127 (what can be encoded in a LEB128 in a single byte) then the size difference gets even smaller, as we must spend 2 bytes (or more) per value to encode.

The complexity increase may seen small (and one could argue it is), but it's another framing style for both KV-Engine and all the SDKs to support; add in things like making sure XATTRs are correctly encoded / removed as appropriate.

Comments / thoughts ... ?

Line:90, engines/ep/src/range_scans/range_scan_callbacks.h -> Please document these - particulary `buffer` as not obvious from name / type what it is used for.

Line:35, include/mcbp/codec/range_scan_continue_codec.h -> Suggest making explicit that the (encoded) key is appended to the end of the vector, not replacing it.

Line:72, include/mcbp/codec/range_scan_continue_codec.h -> Similarly here.

Line:23, /COMMIT_MSG -> Will do, but this is just a simplification, longer term we could make it work with OOO (have the I/O task try..acquire the connection somehow)

Line:125, docs/range_scans/range_scan_continue.md -> Ack

Line:149, docs/range_scans/range_scan_continue.md -> Some early feedback was to keep the framing overall the same, but yes we have to have more varint "headers" to frame each variable chunk.

I was also motivated by size improvements following the usage Query are going to use, that is request continue in batches of 512 (whether a vbucket/range will include more or less than 512 is of course unknown), but if 1 batch was 512 the saving seemed useful.

Fixed:
512*24B (headers) +
512*16B (extra metadata) = 20,480B

Vs
1 x 24B +
512 x 25B meta 
512 x varints for key (1B min 2B max) + 
512 x varints for value (1B min 4B max) = 

The min/max based on the varints 

13,824B min (-32% from fixed)
15,872B max (-22% from fixed)

Although reality is more complex as internally there's a buffer (to be configurable) which fills and triggers each 24B header + data, single 20MB document will currently fill the buffer and trigger the "send"...

Line:149, docs/range_scans/range_scan_continue.md -> So in that query example we are not including the actual value sizes - I was more thinking that once the actual value is included, the difference becomes arguably negligible, assuming a value size or 100B or larger.

I definitely think it's worthwhile for the key-only case (given we can probably assume keys are typically <24B), and hence adding a header per key would double the network cost.

Have you discussed the new packed encoding with the SDK folks - what is their take?

Line:149, docs/range_scans/range_scan_continue.md -> Nod. If people are broadly happy with it, and it has some small but non-zero benefit to size then we can stick with the encoding you have here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:149, docs/range_scans/range_scan_continue.md -> iirc the take is above, keep bulk encoding same/similar and no feedback (negative or positive) on framing from the toy-build people have been using
