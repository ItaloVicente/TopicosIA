DESCRIPTION:

MB-34393: Subdoc: Correctly handle NOT_STORED race when adding doc

During a subdoc mutation, if the user specified doc_flag::Add, and the
key didn't exist at the start of the command processing, but did exist
at the point we finally store the new value (i.e. another connection
added the key just before us), then the engine update fails with
ENGINE_NOT_STORED (as expected).

However, this status isn't correctly handled by the subdocument state
machine, resulting in an exception being thrown and the user
connection being terminated:

    2019-05-30T16:14:39.675236+01:00 WARNING 47: exception occurred in runloop during packet execution.
    <cut>
    conn_execute: Should leave conn_execute for !EWOULDBLOCK

Issue is in checking the status code from subdoc_update() - if other
than SUCCESS or ENGINE_KEY_EEXISTS then the status code isn't passed
back to the cookie correctly. This is the case for bucket_store(ADD)
finding an existing document, where it returns NOT_STORED.
