DESCRIPTION:

MB-33859 [SR]: Add support for Abort in PassiveDM

The PassiveDM exposes a resolvePrepare(key) function that removes the
tracked Prepare identified by key from the internal Container.
The functionis used for both resolution types (Commit/Abort).
Note that In-Order Commit implies that the Prepare eligible for removal
is always the one at Container::begin.
