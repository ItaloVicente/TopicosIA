DESCRIPTION:

MB-33859 [SR]: Add support for Abort in PassiveDM

The PassiveDM exposes a resolvePrepare(key) function that removes the
tracked Prepare identified by key from the internal Container.
The functionis used for both resolution types (Commit/Abort).
Note that In-Order Commit implies that the Prepare eligible for removal
is always the one at Container::begin.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> function is

Line:68, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.h -> Please don't inline this - it shouldn't be hot and just bloats headers.

Line:76, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.h -> We've used 'complete' elsewhere to refer to a SyncWrite which has either been committed or aborted. Suggest the same here - say `completeSyncWrite` for symmetry with addSyncWrite - and maybe even move it up to immediately follow addSyncWrite?

Line:68, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.h -> Done

Line:76, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.h -> Are we happy with using Resolution for the enum and wording on comments. I m happy to rephrase as "Complete the given Prepare.." and using Completion for the enum (but Resolution sounds nicer to me for the enum :) )

Line:76, engines/ep/src/durability/passive_durability_monitor.h -> `Resolution` is a good choice for the enum. 

The design just talks about things like "Once a SyncWrite has been completed..." or "For in-progress (not completed) SyncWrites, ..." so I'd prefer to use "complete / completed" as the general term for Committed / Aborted. `Resolved` is also a reasonable choice but I'd just have to update everywhere in the spec etc now ;)
