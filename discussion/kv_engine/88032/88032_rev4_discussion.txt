DESCRIPTION:

Modifications to the spd logger

1) Add time based flushing of the buffers
2) Restore the file naming of the logfiles so that all external
   tools continue to work as before
3) Removed the deduplication logic in here as it was broken
   (ended up swallowing more data than expecting)

LGTM. I'll let Eugen take a look and give +2 then you can merge both together.

Looks good overall. I just had a few questions and spotted a typo.
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> What exactly happened with deduplication? I wasn't aware there were any bugs

Line:34, extensions/loggers/custom_rotating_file_sink.h -> concatinated -> concatenated

Line:198, tests/logger_test/spdlogger_test.cc -> Is this a leftover from testing or did you mean to leave it in?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> I tried to run the full server with it in there... and it did not put in any lines of the vbuckets being created etc... when I nuked off the deduplication logic the log looked like they used to.... 

Given that it's been so long since the last time I've actually seen that being used I figured we could just live without it for now..

Line:34, extensions/loggers/custom_rotating_file_sink.h -> Done

Line:198, tests/logger_test/spdlogger_test.cc -> it is hard to figure out which file it was missing in ;) I'll extend it with a bit more info
