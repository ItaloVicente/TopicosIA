DESCRIPTION:

MB-25179: Enable connection buffer recycling

Try to release the buffers assigned to each connection every
time a connection is put to sleep if the input or output
buffer is empty.

When the client connection is being scheduled, the framework
assigns an input buffer and an output buffer (the thread local
one is being used if one is available, otherwise a new
buffer is being allocated).

Before the connection goes to sleep all empty buffers would
be returned to the thread (or freed).

Line:1177, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> At this stage in development (master / 5.1) I suggest we turn this into a std::logic_error exception - which we're much more likely to see in testing.

We can add a placeholder MB to drop it back to WARNING, to be fixed before 5.1

Line:1177, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Done

(Hopefully we won't need to do that as I'm hoping we'll complete the move to bufferevents)
