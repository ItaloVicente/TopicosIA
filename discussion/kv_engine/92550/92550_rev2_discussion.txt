DESCRIPTION:

MB-28941: Make tracing of BG_WAIT/LOAD cheaper by reusing timestamps

The session tracing for bgfetch currently has a couple of issues:

1. It takes it's own timings of the span of BG fetch, which is costly.

2. As a result of taking it's own timings, it results in different
   durations compared to the existing bgWait / bgLoad histograms.

Address both of these issues by re-using the timestamps already
recorded for bgLoadHisto / bgWaitHisto; and splitting into two events
(one corresponding to bgLoad; the other to bgWait).
