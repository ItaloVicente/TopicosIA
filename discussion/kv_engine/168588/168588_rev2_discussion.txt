DESCRIPTION:

Reduce cost of including ep_engine.h

ep_engine.h is now the second most costly header to include:

    *** Expensive headers:
    29312 ms: kv_engine/include/mcbp/protocol/request.h (included 162 times, avg 180 ms)
    27828 ms: kv_engine/engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h (included 71 times, avg 391 ms)

A large portion of it's cost is it includes <spdlog/logger.h>
indirectly via error_handler.h. error_handler.h is only needed to
access a single enum type (ErrorHandlingMethod).

Move ErrorHandlingMethod to ep_types.h which avoids having to include
error_handler.h and consequently <spdlog/logger.h> from ep_engine.h.

Before:

    27828 ms: kv_engine/engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h (included 71 times, avg 391 ms)

After:
    21727 ms: kv_engine/engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h (included 71 times, avg 306 ms)
