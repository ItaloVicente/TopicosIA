DESCRIPTION:

MB-27162: Update revision sequence number before adding to checkpoint

When a given item has been deleted and then recreated in memory, a new
stored value is created with a revision sequence number of 1 and pushed
into the checkpoint and the item's revision sequence number is updated in
memory. But, given that it could be potentially recreated, it should be
set to a value that is 1 greater than the maximum revision sequence number
for a deleted item in the vbucket and then pushed into the checkpoint
