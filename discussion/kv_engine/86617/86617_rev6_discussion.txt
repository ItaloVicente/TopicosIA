DESCRIPTION:

MB-27162: Update revision sequence number before adding to checkpoint

When a given item has been deleted and then recreated in memory, a new
stored value is created with a revision sequence number of 1 and pushed
into the checkpoint and the item's revision sequence number is updated in
memory. But, given that it could be potentially recreated, it should be
set to a value that is 1 greater than the maximum revision sequence number
for a deleted item in the vbucket and then pushed into the checkpoint

Thanks for the quick fix / turnaround on this issue - much appreciated!

Couple of suggestions to make the fix a little cleaner. Also I think we also want a test which validates the warmup path (which I believe would affect value eviction) - i.e. if we restarted the engine instead of evicting. Probably best to do that as a ep_testsuite-style test (as we have support for reloading the engine there).
Line:1505, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Given we already return a pointer to the modified value; I think it's cleaner to use that to return the updated revid; otherwise it's not clear from the caller what in Item is modified.

Line:1507, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Given this function is only called from 2-3 places; I think it's clearer to give this argument a default value.

Line:860, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/kv_bucket_test.cc -> There's probably no harm in also running this for value eviction also?

Warmup could be done in the SingleThreaded harness if it helps test stability http://src.couchbase.org/source/xref/spock/kv_engine/engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc#1415

Line:1507, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Not sure what you mean by a default value. Doesn't this parameter already have a default value of GenerateRevSeqno::Yes?

Line:1507, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Sorry, I mis-typed - I meant it would be clearer to *not* give it a default value :)
