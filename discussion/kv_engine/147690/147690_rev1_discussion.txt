DESCRIPTION:

Refactor RangeItr construction to make members const

maxVisibleSeqno and highCompletedSeqno of a RangeItr should be
const as we want their values at the point of RangeItr creation.
Make them const by moving lock acquisition to the factory function
and pass a reference to the lock to the ctor of the RangeItr.

Line:435, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> We can make the 2 members const without moving the lock acquisition out of the RangeIteratorLL ctor.
What's the reason for moving the lock acquisition?
The RangeIteratorLL::ctor seems its natural place, as you say in the commit message "maxVisibleSeqno and highCompletedSeqno of a RangeItr should be
const as we want their values at the point of RangeItr creation"

Line:435, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> That would introduce a race condition though in which we could take values for MVS and HCS, update them to new values, then take our rangeGuard. If our HCS value is incorrect we could send a prepare that is logically now completed to a replica which risks hitting MB-44079 if we have a very short purge interval. Additionally I think it could also break the MVS sending the correct snap end value.

Line:435, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> Sorry probably I didn't explain myself.

Before this change we have
    RangeIteratorLL::create()
        -> RangeIteratorLL::RangeIteratorLL() <- THIS IS WHERE WE LOCK THE SEQLIST

After this change we have
    RangeIteratorLL::create() <- THIS IS WHERE WE LOCK THE SEQLIST
        -> RangeIteratorLL::RangeIteratorLL(Lock&)

Why do we need that?
It doesn't seem that we are fixing anything by that.
And if we do, what do we fix exactly? Is there a test for what we are fixing?

Line:435, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> We're not fixing anything here, the change is just so that we can make the members that should be const const. To do that we need to take the lock before we call the ctor to ensure that the HCS and MVS are correct.

Line:435, engines/ep/src/linked_list.cc -> Oh I didn't consider that we need to initialize them in the init-list for making them const
