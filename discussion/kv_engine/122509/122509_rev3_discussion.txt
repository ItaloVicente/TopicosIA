DESCRIPTION:

MB-32358: Add DCP Seqno Advance opcode

Add DCP_SEQNO_ADVANCED opcode to allow DCP producers to inform DCP
client consumers that the seqno for a vbucket has advanced but there
are no "visible mutation" for it e.g. there are mutation for collections
that client is not subscribed for or there are sync-write
prepares/aborts.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:813, daemon/protocol/mcbp/engine_wrapper.cc -> I don't believe we should as a the kv should never receive this DCP opcode see Jims comment on patch two

Line:6, docs/dcp/documentation/commands/seqno-advanced.md -> Done

Line:7, docs/dcp/documentation/commands/seqno-advanced.md -> Done

Line:7, docs/dcp/documentation/commands/seqno-advanced.md -> Done

File Comment: docs/dcp/documentation/protocol.md -> :D :roger:
Line:407, engines/nobucket/nobucket.cc -> ah yes but its a bug was going to just fix it in the same patch but can split it out into a separate one.

Line:415, include/memcached/dcp.h -> its a clang tidy fix should but like the no bucket change I can move it to another patch

Line:813, daemon/protocol/mcbp/engine_wrapper.cc -> I guess that here we should find the implementation of

ENGINE_ERROR_CODE dcpSeqnoAdvanced(Cookie& cookie, uint64_t seqno);

Line:499, daemon/protocol/mcbp/engine_wrapper.h -> delete if not needed, given KV never expects to recieve the command we should not need a function here (just like the OSO snapshot command).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: docs/dcp/documentation/commands/seqno-advanced.md -> We should add a sentence to explain that HELLO collections is the trigger for this command being used

Given in 7.0 all DCP consumers will need HELLO collections to do anything sensible, it should be sufficient!

File Comment: docs/dcp/documentation/protocol.md -> Can you also update https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/BinaryProtocol.md

It has links to the commands

Also whilst changing that file please can you fix https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/BinaryProtocol.md because the links to dcp/ are broken :D thanks! (they are missing part of the path)
