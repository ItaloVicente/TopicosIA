DESCRIPTION:

MB-30532: Add the new 'DCP Consumer mutation latency' perftest

The investigation on MB-30019/MB-30234 has spotted slow runtimes for
a DCP Consumer when processing incoming mutation.

I introduce a new test in ep_perfsuite to measure the latency of
DcpIface::mutation in EPEngine.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Could you include an example of the output (and the initial timings) for this new benchmark in the commit message?
Line:1174, engines/ep/tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Great, detailed comment.

However, I'd say that having this kind of comment in the commit message is actually a better place; as it gives the "what and why" behind the change; helping reviewers get orientated with what code they are about to review.

Having such a detailed justification of the reasons behind the test in the code is unnecessary detail. By all means explain what the test does (the latter few sentences), but keep the background in the commit message - people who care about the context (why) of a change can easily look at the commit message to get more detail.

Line:1179, engines/ep/tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Style: consider making const if this never changes.

Line:1211, engines/ep/tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> IIRC checkeq()'s arguments are "expected, actual" (unfortunately different to GTest :(

Line:1216, engines/ep/tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Style - you've essentially discarded the type of the time unit here (just a raw count), in a variable named 'begin' - so a later reader / the compiler won't be able to detect if you say tried to mix with microseconds.

Prefer just keeping as the concrete (strongly-typed) time-point; then only convert to a raw count when you later need to. This is also more terse:

 auto begin = ProcessClock::now();
 ...
 auto end = ProcessClock::now();
 timings.push_back(end - begin);

Line:1218, engines/ep/tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Might be worth adding a comment around here that as this is the last mutation in the snapshot; receiving it triggers the function we are trying to measure: handleSnapshotEnd. (It wasn't immediately obvious to me when reading the code that was the case - I was initially looking at snapshot_marker above).

Line:1176, engines/ep/tests/ep_perfsuite.cc -> Consider changing the name as the test is forcing a snapshot end as opposed to a plain mutation
