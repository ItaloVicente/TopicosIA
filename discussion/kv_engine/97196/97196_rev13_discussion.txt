DESCRIPTION:

MB-30532: Add the new 'DCP Consumer snap-end mutation latency' perftest

I introduce a new test in ep_perfsuite to measure the latency of
DcpIface::mutation in EPEngine.

The performance issue in MB-30019 / MB-30234 is the main reason
behind this test.
Essentially, if the Consumer is slow in processing incoming DCP
mutations, then the mc:worker thread that manages the DCP connection
slows down and delays in processing other managed connections, which
could be front-end MCBP connections.
Thus, a slow DCP Consumer may degrade the throughput of front-end
operations.

In the case of MB-30234, the throughput degradation is caused by slow
runtimes of PassiveStream::processMutation.
It would be important to spot performance regressions quickly, so here I
introduce a perf-test to measure the runtime of that execution path.

The interesting part of the call stack is:

    DcpConsumer::mutation
        PassiveStream::messageReceived
            PassiveStream::processMutation
                PassiveStream::handleSnapshotEnd
                    CheckpointManager::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint

If the Producer sends many tiny snapshots to the Consumer, then the
PassiveStream::handleSnapshotEnd function is executed very often.
E.g., if the Producer sends many 1-item snapshots, the function is
executed at every incoming mutation.

Note that the main purpose of PassiveStream::handleSnapshotEnd is to
close the open checkpoint (call to
CheckpointManager::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint) if certain conditions
apply.

In the case of memory-snapshots, the current condition is
(mem_used>high_wat), which makes the execution to skip the call most
times. That may result in huge open checkpoints consuming most of the
BucketQuota, which is the issue in MB-30019 (where we execute a bulk
load of 1 Billion items, + 1 replica).

In fact, my first attempt to fix MB-30019 is the cause of MB-30234.
I removed the (mem_used>high_wat) condition mentioned above, which led
the code to execute CheckpointManager::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint
unconditionally and very often (in MB-30019 the Producer sends many
small snapshots).
That had 2 effects:
    1) the expected positive one:
        we had a constant (low_wat < mem_used < high_wat)
    2) a negative one:
        I spotted that CheckpointManager::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint is
        suboptimal, and in particular very slow when the number of
        checkpoints is high, which is the case if we constantly close
        the open checkpoint at every incoming mutation.
        That caused the throughput degradation in MB-30234.

Note that my first attempt to fix MB-30019 has been reverted for
MB-30234, so currently we are skipping the call to
CheckpointManager::checkAndAddNewCheckpoint (most times in real
executions, always in this test), so here I show an example of output if
I re-introduce the regression on my local environment:
