DESCRIPTION:

MB-49811 Make magma_enable_block_cache a dynamic config

In the linked MB, *after* the workload finished, objects in BlockCache
were left fragmented. In such an idle cluster, the best way to fix this
fragmentation is to reallocate those objects onto lower memory addresses
that are free. This is what a defragmenter does. Magma defragmenter is
targeted for Morpheus release.

As a stop-gap solution for Neo release, we provide users the option of
disabling BlockCache dynamically. This results in deallocating all
objects in BlockCache and hence gets rid of the fragmentation. This
option can also be used to turn on the cache once we're free of the
fragmentation.

Command example:

Turn off:
cbepctl localhost:12000 -b magma -u Administrator -p asdasd set
flush_param magma_enable_block_cache false

Turn on:
cbepctl localhost:12000 -b magma -u Administrator -p asdasd set
flush_param magma_enable_block_cache true

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

Would we recommend that customers run this periodically if we see symptoms of this or just disable the block cache entirely? Do we know if running this periodically even solves the issue (i.e. how quickly do we get fragmented again)? If we are going to run with the block cache disabled do we know how that will perform?

If the fragmentation comes back again and again, it would be better to turn it off entirely. For the situation seen in MB, disabling/enabling is only required once. So the answer is really workload dependent.

I ran some tests to answer this. It seems if we have sufficient free memory for Linux page cache, turning off block cache makes no difference. If there is insufficient free memory, then we'll start to incur extra read IO. We plan to do a weekly run with block cache turned off for further assessment.
