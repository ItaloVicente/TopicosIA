DESCRIPTION:

MB-49811 Make magma_enable_block_cache a dynamic config

In the linked MB, *after* the workload finished, objects in BlockCache
were left fragmented. In such an idle cluster, the best way to fix this
fragmentation is to reallocate those objects onto lower memory addresses
that are free. This is what a defragmenter does. Magma defragmenter is
targeted for Morpheus release.

As a stop-gap solution for Neo release, we provide users the option of
disabling BlockCache dynamically. This results in deallocating all
objects in BlockCache and hence gets rid of the fragmentation. This
option can also be used to turn on the cache once we're free of the
fragmentation.

Command example:

Turn off:
cbepctl localhost:12000 -b magma -u Administrator -p asdasd set
flush_param magma_enable_block_cache false

Turn on:
cbepctl localhost:12000 -b magma -u Administrator -p asdasd set
flush_param magma_enable_block_cache true

Do we know if running this periodically even solves the issue (i.e. how quickly do we get fragmented again)? If we are going to run with the block cache disabled do we know how that will perform?

If there is insufficient free memory, then we'll start to incur extra read IO. We plan to do a weekly run with block cache turned off for further assessment.

Sure I'll put the results on this page:
