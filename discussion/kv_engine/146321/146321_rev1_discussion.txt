DESCRIPTION:

Revert "MB-43818: GlobalTask::execute: Log task info if exception thrown"

This reverts commit 98c2ff45b6a9c1ef6af22c6f9317965b45170885.


Reason for revert: Now FollyExecutorPool no longer catches exceptions
on bg threads (see MB-44253), we don't want to catch them ourselves in
GlobalTask - we want them to be uncaught and trigger std::terminate
with a full backtrace to where the exception was thrown from.
