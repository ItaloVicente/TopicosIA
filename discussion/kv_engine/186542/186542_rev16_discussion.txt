DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Unify read/write callbacks for folly

Move the read/write callbacks used in the core to a
common location and use the same callbacks in the async client
used for testing.

After the move the code is isolated in such a way that it is
easy to write unit tests (not part of this patch) and possibly
other benchmarks

Please note that the folly connections is not yet used in our
product (only a prototype which may be enabled by setting
environment variables) and in some of our unit tests.
