DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Unify read/write callbacks for folly

Move the read/write callbacks used in the core to a
common location and use the same callbacks in the async client
used for testing.

After the move the code is isolated in such a way that it is
easy to write unit tests (not part of this patch) and possibly
other benchmarks
