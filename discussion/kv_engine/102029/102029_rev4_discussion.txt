DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Refactor passing of DeleteSource through functions

This patch removes the unnessessary passing of DeleteSource through
some functions. This is due to the fact that StoredValue now holds
the deletionSource so, as long as this passed through to where the
StoredValue is deleted, the deletionSource can instead be picked
up from the already passed StoredValue.
