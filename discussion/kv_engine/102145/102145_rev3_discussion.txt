DESCRIPTION:

MB-30624: Validate correct collection key length

Prior to collections, the maximum key which may exists is 250 bytes long.
A collection aware client may still need to access those 'legacy' keys, and
thus must be able to form a key 251 byte in length (1 byte collection-id + 250
bytes of key).

For keys in collections the collection-id can take from 1 byte up to 5 bytes,
so in theory 255 bytes could be the max keylen, however the collections design
does not wish (or need) to consume every bit of the 1 byte length field.
Allowing for future encodings to use the extra bits for escapes...

So a collection client will have the following restrictions, note logical
key-bytes refers to the bytes of the key after the leb128 prefix is removed.

* If the collection-ID is the DefaultCollection (value of 0) the
 logical key bytes can be 1 to 250.
* If the collection-ID is not the DefaultCollection then we will restrict the
logical key bytes to 1 to 246. This ensures that the longest key will always be
accessible even if the collection-ID varies from 1 to 5 bytes.

A non collection connection still has the following restrictions:

* key length must be 1 to 250.

Overall key length values in the range 252 to 255 are unused and reserved for
future use.
