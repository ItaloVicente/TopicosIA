DESCRIPTION:

MB-34946: Remove prepare when receiving overwriting mutation

When a replica is backfilling from disk it will often be sent
a Mutation instead of a Commit. This Mutation logically commits the
prepare that the replica may already have. Currently the code will
overwrite the prepare with a mutation. This is not valid as the
replica may already have a mutation for this commit and a following
lookup in the HashTable would cause a precondition to fail as there
would now exist two commited StoredValues in the HashTable.

Instead, the replica should either remove the prepare (EP vBuckets)
or mark it as completed (Ephemeral vBuckets) and either add a new
mutation or overwrite the existing one. Update the setWithMeta and
deleteWithMeta functions that are called by the replica to process
this mutation instead of a commit to lookup both the prepare and
committed StoredValues and deal with them appropriately.

Line:863, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Nit: More about "no longer owned" and avoiding the double stats update.

Given the trickiness / subtly of this issue when developing I think it's worth adding a brief comment explaining this.

Line:760, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> While accurate, this is somewhat hard to follow. Maybe also add a higher-level sentence explaining the rationale for the calculation.

Line:1842, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Do we really need all these extra methods? Arn't they identical to the non-setWithMeta variant, apart from they allow a SET to succeed if a Prepare exists?

In which case can't we just check the vBucket status (active / not active) and only allow SET against PREPARE if non-active?

Line:2437, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Suggest documenting that the Proxy is modified to no longer own the prepare after the call.

Line:863, engines/ep/src/ep_vb.cc -> Done

Line:760, engines/ep/src/hash_table.h -> Hopefully this is a little better

Line:1842, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Technically no, but the signature has changed and I didn't want to update all the other callers to find and pass through the FindCommitResult and StoredValue*

Line:2437, engines/ep/src/vbucket.h -> Done
