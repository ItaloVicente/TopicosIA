DESCRIPTION:

MB-33423: Don't unnecessarily reset cursor

It was incorrectly thought that the reason the cursor sometimes remained
valid after being removed from the cursor map was due to other uses of
the underlying shared pointer not yet being out of scope.  Therefore an
explict attempt was made to reset the cursor after being removed from
the map.

The actual explaination is that when removeCheckpointCursor is invoked
from dropCheckpointCursor_UNLOCKED (due to cursor dropping) it will
have a non-null value after being removed from the cursor map.  The
reason is that the top level method handleSlowStream takes
cursor.lock().get() as an argument.  Therefore the cursor is not reset
until we return from this handleSlowStream method.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> Could you qualify this with DcpConnMap:: so it's not ambiguous which method you're referring to (and hence my earlier confusion!)
