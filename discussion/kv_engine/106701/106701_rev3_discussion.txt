DESCRIPTION:

MB-33423: Don't unnecessarily reset cursor

It was incorrectly thought that the reason the cursor sometimes remained
valid after being removed from the cursor map was due to other uses of
the underlying shared pointer not yet being out of scope.  Therefore an
explict attempt was made to reset the cursor after being removed from
the map.

The actual explaination is that when removeCheckpointCursor is invoked
from dropCheckpointCursor_UNLOCKED (due to cursor dropping) it will
have a non-null value after being removed from the cursor map.  The
reason is that the top level method handleSlowStream takes
cursor.lock().get() as an argument.  Therefore the cursor is not reset
until we return from this handleSlowStream method.

Line:1646, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> I think this is a little confusing - we shouldn't really need to document how _other_ methods happen to call a particular method and the consequences of it. 

Specifically:

>  When this method is invoked from dropCheckpointCursor_UNLOCKED
>  the value returned from cursor.lock().get() remains non-null at
>  the point of return.

This doesn't make sense - assuming you're referring to line 1659 below, as soon as removeCursor() returns the rvalue `cursor.lock().get` goes out of scope, and the shared_ptr is deleted.

Moreover, handleSlowStream() doesn't take any arguments - where is cursor.lock().get() used there?

Line:1646, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> In checkpoint_remover we call:

engine->getDcpConnMap().handleSlowStream(vbid, cursor.lock().get())

and hence is why it remains non-null until the function returns.

"as soon as removeCursor() returns the rvalue `cursor.lock().get` goes out of scope, and the shared_ptr is deleted" - unfortunately this is not true when called from handleSlowStream (I added debug to confirm), which was why I added the reset.  But the addition was based on a misunderstanding. We should just wait until the shared_ptr to get reset on returning from handleSlowStream.

Line:1646, engines/ep/src/dcp/active_stream.cc -> Ah, you're talking about DcpConnMap::handleSlowStream() - not ActiveStream::handleSlowStream which I was looking at.

Having said that, I think my point still holds - we shouldn't be documenting in a leaf function what a function 4-5 level up which called it does.
