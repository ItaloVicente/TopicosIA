DESCRIPTION:

[BP] MB-36802: Don't return estimate=0 for dcp-takeover stats before backfill

[Backport of MB-35594.]

The 'dcp-takeover' stats are used by ns_server to estimate how many
mutations are remaining on a DCP stream. However, the estimate value
is not updated until the backfill task has run once (and scanned the
disk file). As such, if 'dcp-takeover' stats are requested before that
first backfil task has run, then they can incorrectly report '0'
backfill items.

To address this, change backfillRemaining to be of type
boost::optional, initialized to an empty optional.

Only when the backfill scan has completed (when the number of items
remaining is determined) is the optional populated.

Then, when stats are requested use a new status value
"calculating-item-count" if the optional is empty (i.e. before scan).
