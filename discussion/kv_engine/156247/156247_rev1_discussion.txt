DESCRIPTION:

Don't call shutdown_server from signal handler

shutdown_server isn't signal-safe. Instead we should just
set the memcached_shutdown variable to true as that is signal
safe.

The clock callback happens every second and will poll the
shutdown variable.

Note that the sigterm and sigint handler isn't the "normal" way
to initiate shutdown, that happens from:

  a) the parent process close stdin
  b) someone sends shutdown request

Line:1040, daemon/memcached.cc -> I'm unsure if this will reintroduce MB-20034 (just re-read the MB, and there were a few issues). Plenty could of changed, but just can't say for sure. However it would be signal safe to retain the mutex/condvar and only set the boolean 'memcached_shutdown' when `memcached_can_shutdown` is true

Line:1040, daemon/memcached.cc -> We shouldn't be reintroducing that bug as now we won't try to call anything in shutdown_server apart forom setting the shutdown variable to true. Now all of the threads _MUST_ be up'n'running at the time when we enter the libevent loop, and it is the clock callback which would break out of the libevent loop and shut down things.

Btw. the condition variable code in the callback isn't safe as none of the mutex/cond vars are signal safe

Misunderstanding the conversation with Jim. I wasn't aware that he would be looking into this.

Ah cool, thanks for the clarification w.r.t to that old MB! I think the approach is fine. I'm not working on this yet, but do have the signal safety MB assigned to me and was planning on it before closing the MB. Looks likely this patch will do, just with the commit message including the signal safety MB
