DESCRIPTION:

Add callback driven stats call to internal client

Going through std::map and json parsers may change
the order of the keys (and it'll also simplify some
parsing in unit tests).

Line:38, protocol/connection/client_connection.h -> <functional> is a pretty expensive header to pull in. Can you get away with a forward-decl of std::function - according to https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/functional/function it should be:

 namespace std {
 template< class R, class... Args >
 class function<R(Args...)>;
 };

Line:481, protocol/connection/client_connection.h -> Nit: by using std::string as a default argument you're forcing the creation of a std::string which can be costly. You're also forcing the caller to construct a string to pass, even if they themselves don't have a complete object.

Given the above, const_char_buffer is a better choice as that can accept either a non-owning or owning sequence of chars.

Line:38, protocol/connection/client_connection.h -> Done
(C++ starts to become a hassle to work with ;) It puts too much burden on developers to try to move out of its inefficiencies.)

Line:481, protocol/connection/client_connection.h -> BinprotGenericCommand requires a std::string, so if I force through a cb::const_char_buffer here I'd need to create a string inside the function... by requiring a std::string here I don't need to create another string object inside the method...

It's beyond the scope here to refactor all of the internal packets to use cb::const_char_buffers to build up the packets.

Line:481, protocol/connection/client_connection.h -> Ok, fair enough - although this is increasing the `const std::string&` "pollution" in the mcbp APIs. Would be nice to clean it all up so we can avoid memory allocation in most of the hot paths...
