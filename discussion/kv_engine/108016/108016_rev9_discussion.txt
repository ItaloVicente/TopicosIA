DESCRIPTION:

MB-33836 [SR]: Implement High Prepared Seqno (HPS) logic in ActiveDM

The HPS represents the last locally-satisfied Prepare on a node.
As per In-Order Ack/Commit, the HPS is updated within the
"durability-fence" constraint. See DesignDoc for details.

Practically, an HPS update at Active is triggered in response of one of
the following events:
1) A new Prepare is queued into the ActiveDM. The new Prepare may be
  locally-satisfied immediatelly.
2) The Flusher has persisted some Prepare. That may "move" the
  durability-fence onward and satisfy a number of pending Prepares.

There HPS implementation at Active differs from the one at Replica on
two main points:
a) Level:MajorityAndPersistOnMaster does enforce a durability-fence at
  Active (while it does not at Replica)
b) The internal implementation of the HPS at Active is what we used to
  know as the Active (local) tracking in FirstChain. So (differently
  from the PassiveDM) we don't need a new tracked-quantity in ActiveDM.
  With this patch we just fix the "move-semantic" of the Active
  tracking in FirstChain to be consistent with the HPS rules.
