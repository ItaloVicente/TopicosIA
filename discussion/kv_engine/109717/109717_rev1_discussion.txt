DESCRIPTION:

MB-33332: Fix issues due to merge conflict

Two issues here:
1) The epehemeral Abort code did not consider the new committed state
PreparedMaybeVisible. Fix the Abort code to use the isPending check.
2) Not sure what happened to the CommitExisting_RangeRead test but
the test was invalid in that if we do any writes whilst there is a
range read then we will never attempt to write anything in that range.
Fix the test by correcting the logic to what was intended, grabbing a
range read covering an already committed value and then do another
commit.
