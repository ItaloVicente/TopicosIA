DESCRIPTION:

MB-22010: Fix disabled_users filtering bugs

Fix bug with the new configuation option: disabled_users. The bug is
that when converting the configuration to JSON the
disabled_users list was being populated from the disabled list.

In addition there was a memory leak when an audit event is filtered
by a user.

This patch fixes the bugs, and introduces a test to defend against
regression.
