DESCRIPTION:

Use folly::SharedMutex when calling into the engine

The core holds a read lock to the mutex when calling
the normal methods in the engine interface, and holds
the write lock when calling initiate_shutdown to
ensure that there is no front end threads running
in the engine at the same time.

Line:115, daemon/buckets.h -> If you alternatively turn this into a folly::Synchronized<State>  then that will automatically acquire the lock everytime the state is accessed. Avoids the need for manual mutex locking / unlocking.

Or possibly the same thing on the all_buckets[] array - so that when you call getBucket() you automatically acquire the lock.

Line:115, daemon/buckets.h -> Not 100% sure where you would have wanted to acquire the lock... ideally it could have been acquired in conn_execute, but that woud "break" select bucket as there we're moving to another bucket.. 

To be honest I'm a bit scared of all of this with respect to where we are in the release cycle. Every time we've tried to tighten up the logic we've seen some sort of hang situations because thing didn't always behave the way we thought it would (like deadlocks due to lock ordering into libevents internal)... I'm tempted to drop all of this and rather call initiate_shutdown potential multiple times if cookies isn't getting disconnected within a reasonable time...

Line:115, daemon/buckets.h -> Fair enough - that might be the best plan for now. 

(I think ideally we want what I outlined on Slack - for the record:)

 the server should:
 All that to me implies that on bucket delete, the server should:
 A) Stop any new requests into the engine. 
 B) Tell the engine to complete (cancel) anything currently in-flight. 
 C) wait for in-flight ops (i.e. step B) to finish then delete bucket.

if that was done (without any races) then the engine's role would be pretty simple - just cancel in-flight stuff when told to.
