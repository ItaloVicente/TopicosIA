DESCRIPTION:

MB-39344: Allow expelling all non-meta items in checkpoint

The historical problem of unrecoverable OOM on replica checkpoints has
been highly releaved in Neo compared to the previous releases, but not
totally solved.

In particular, low-end envs with low memory quotas might experience
hard OOM in scenarios like simple data loads or rebalance-in. That
happens in cases where the doc size is high enough to eat the CMQuota
by a few docs spread across multiple vbucekts, eg:
 1. BucketQuota 100MB, CMQuota 30MB
 2. Doc size 10MB
 3. 4 vbuckets
 4. Load 10 docs on Node1 - no replica yet
 5. RebIn Node2

At (5) Node2 might receive ~ 3 docs across multiple replica vbuckets,
1 doc per vbucket. That allocates ~ 30MB in checkpoints (ie CMQuota
full), but:
 a. Replica checkpoints are open and won't close unless the node
    receives some new snapshots over those streams immediately. So
    checkpoints can't be released by CheckpointRemoval.
 b. We can't Expel the items in those checkpoints as we can't remove
    the last item in a checkpoint

We fix the problem by solving (b). With this patch ItemExpel is
capable to remove all the items in a checkpoint if memory recovery
requires so. With all items we refer to non-meta items only, so the
integrity of the checkpoint is preserved.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> relieved

Line:105, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_cursor.h -> Please expand the comments here, to be explicit about how "checkpoint begin" and "checkpoint start" are diffferent.

Line:280, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> I think you can simplify this - modify initialisation of ckptIt (originally line 294) to skip past any checkpoints which are empty by Expel. 

That means you don't need two different paths through this code, and it highlights the core logic of the function is always the same - we simply register a cursor at the earliest _valid_ seqno which meets the users request.

Line:1854, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> Please document the "magic" -1 here.

Line:105, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_cursor.h -> Done

Line:280, engines/ep/src/checkpoint_manager.cc -> So that was my first attempt :)

Problem is that in the existing loop below:
1. the checkpoint state checks are all based on Checkpoint::getMinimumCursorSeqno()/getHighSeqno() that are meaningless if expel has emptied the checkpoint
2. there is no "skip all empty checkpoints" if there's 1 checkpoint only - essentially we would end up the same special branch within the loop - which would be fine, but the early exit here remarks that the logic below isn't really valid in the case that we handle here.

Plus, note the sanity checks at line 306. Those are invalid too in if there's just 1 open/empty-by-expel checkpoint
