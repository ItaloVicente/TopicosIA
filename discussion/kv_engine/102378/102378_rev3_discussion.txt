DESCRIPTION:

MB-26907: Integrate Expiration event handling into passive stream

This patch adds the differentiation between an expiry and a deletion
when the event is triggered within passive stream. This requires the
addition of DeleteSource to deleteWithMeta.

Line:655, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Remove the default case - then the compiler can warn if you add a new enumeration value and don't cover it.

To handle the case where something goes wrong (e.g. origin is not in the set of valid enum values) - and to keep the compiler happy move the throw to after the switch - typically I do something like check if `bytes` has been assigned to check that one of the switches was executed.

Line:603, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> This is very similar to processDeletion - can you combine the bulk of them into a single common function which processExpiration / processDeletion both call?

Line:618, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> expiration?

Line:481, engines/ep/src/dcp/response.h -> Didn't really follow this part of the sentence - could you expand / re-word?

Line:1489, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> Prefer switch.

Line:1491, engines/ep/src/vbucket.cc -> So see the comment at line 1485..1488 - the active should have already pruned the system XATTRs; and hence calling processExpiredItem I think could be incorrect (or at least inefficient) here - we should simply store the already-pruned value the active sent us; just with the correct delete source.

Can you check if this is correct - and if we have test coverage for it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:603, engines/ep/src/dcp/passive_stream.cc -> processMutation is the same in this regard, so I have aded processMessage to merge all three's similar elements.
