DESCRIPTION:

MB-35281: Print hint if select_bucket fails in cbvbucketctl

Previously:

 EOFError: Got empty data (remote died?).

Would be logged if selecting a non-existent bucket (or selecting a
bucket without previously authing).

Now:

 EOFError: Got empty data (remote died?).

 EOF while selecting bucket - does bucket "defaul" exist?

Which at least hints to the user what may be wrong. Continue to print
the exception backtrace to avoid hiding valid EOFErrors.
