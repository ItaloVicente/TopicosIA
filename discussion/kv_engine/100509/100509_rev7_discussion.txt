You can probably add the rest of the team now as reviewers.
Line:841, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> Worth explaining *why* this is the case - the reader can see from the comment what is occurring here, but not the rationale for it...

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:842, engines/ep/src/dcp/producer.cc -> I was referring to the highlighted comment on line 841 - and was referring to the fact includeDeleteTime is being enabled.

Suggest something like:

 Expiry opcode uses the same encoding as deleteV2 (includes delete time); therefore a client enabling expiry_opcode also implicitly enables includeDeletetime.
