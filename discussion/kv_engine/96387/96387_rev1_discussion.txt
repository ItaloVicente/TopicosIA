While I agree it would be nice to be more consistent, I don't think this is worth the code churn / changes in blame / additional merge conflicts this could add in future.

(I might be ok if you'd just done a rename on the files which Git is pretty good at detecting; but the code changes in failover_table.h / failover_table.cc itself are problematic).

(As an aside, failover-table isn't the only one which uses hyphens - see dcp-, backfill-, etc. While in an ideal world it would be all consistent, I don't think the costs of changing this (aforementioned blame changes; breaking people's muscle-memory, still inconsistencies elsewhere) outweight the benefits.
