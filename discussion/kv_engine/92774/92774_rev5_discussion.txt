DESCRIPTION:

MB-29262: When scanning the seqno index, use the persisted manifest

When a scan is performed we check if items belong to a deleted
collection by calling isLogicallyDeleted, this previously always
used the in-memory manifest to determine the state of the key. This
however is dangerous, particularly when the result of a scan is used
to feed DCP (e.g. backfill_disk).

The in-memory manifest can easily lose updates if a node crashes
allowing a situation when we can backfill a client and drop keys
before a crash, but then after the node restarts a client can stream
and now receive keys which would of been dropped before the crash.

A simple example is a client asking for seqno ranges.

First they ask for all collection keys from seqno 0-10, assume seqno
3 and 4 are for the 'beer' collection which has been deleted from
the memory manifest, but not yet flushed to disk.

* Backfill will send 0 to 9 but drop 3 and 4 (3 is 'create-beer')
* Scan completes and client has received all keys.
* memcached crashes before the beer delete fact has been persisted.
* memcached restarts
* Client reconnects and now asks for 10-19, assume 15 and 16 are
  'beer' mutations
* Backfill will now send every key, none are logically deleted
* Client gets beer keys and has never seen a create-beer or any prior
  'beer' key, an incorrect view of the data.

If the scan drops keys based on the persisted manifest, then this
situation will not occur.

(4 comments)

Approach looks good. Mostly some comments on code layout; to try to minimise #include spiderwebs...
Line:21, engines/ep/src/callbacks.h -> If we inline the constructor of CacheLookup can we avoid pulling in this header (and just forward-declare CachingReadHandle)?

Unless we really need CacheLookup inlined (which at first glance I don't think we do); I think it's preferred to minimise the number of headers included.

Line:3, engines/ep/src/collections/scan_context.h -> Nit: 2018

Line:35, engines/ep/src/collections/scan_context.h -> I believe this is no longer true in the current design - I assume the main motivation now is having a consistent manifest set?

Line:23, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> Similary here; given it looks like we only refer to ScanContext in the header as either a reference or as a template to unique_ptr we should be able to avoid including this here.

*EDIT*: Ah yes, I see it's used in ScanContext below :( Might be worth moving that class to it's own header file; to avoid having to pull in collections/scan_context.h into kvstore.h.

updating soon
Line:3, engines/ep/src/collections/scan_context.h -> I think i actually wrote the first 'scan_context' in 2017 :eek: just been sitting in local branches for a while

Line:35, engines/ep/src/collections/scan_context.h -> Done

Line:21, engines/ep/src/callbacks.h -> Being an inner-class of Manifest, you can't forward declare CachingReadHandle

Line:23, engines/ep/src/kvstore.h -> There's more to it than just ScanContext, compaction_ctx may have a unique_ptr, but the compiler defined ~compaction_ctx wants to destroy the Collections::VB::ScanContext and as such needs the definition. A number of objects need tweaking including an empty ~compaction_ctx defined in the .cc
