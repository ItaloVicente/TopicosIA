DESCRIPTION:

MB-29262: When scanning the seqno index, use the persisted manifest

When a scan is performed we check if items belong to a deleted
collection by calling isLogicallyDeleted, this previously always
used the in-memory manifest to determine the state of the key. This
however is dangerous, particularly when the result of a scan is used
to feed DCP (e.g. backfill_disk).

The in-memory manifest can easily lose updates if a node crashes
allowing a situation when we can backfill a client and drop keys
before a crash, but then after the node restarts a client can stream
and now receive keys which would of been dropped before the crash.

A simple example is a client asking for seqno ranges.

First they ask for all collection keys from seqno 0-10, assume seqno
3 and 4 are for the 'beer' collection which has been deleted from
the memory manifest, but not yet flushed to disk.

* Backfill will send 0 to 9 but drop 3 and 4 (3 is 'create-beer')
* Scan completes and client has received all keys.
* memcached crashes before the beer delete fact has been persisted.
* memcached restarts
* Client reconnects and now asks for 10-19, assume 15 and 16 are
  'beer' mutations
* Backfill will now send every key, none are logically deleted
* Client gets beer keys and has never seen a create-beer or any prior
  'beer' key, an incorrect view of the data.

If the scan drops keys based on the persisted manifest, then this
situation will not occur.

Test-code required some tweaking as we have clash with boost/list.hpp
and ep_test_apis.h both defining check(), this occurred because
callbacks.h now includes vbucket_manifest (and then boost).
callbacks.h has been removed from test_helpers.h

Line:221, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> While these might be physically const; they don't seem like they are logically const (given they change the underlying manifest's disk count). Can we get rid of `const` modifier  or does that cause all kinds of compile problems?

Line:560, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Ditto for these two methods.

Line:2471, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Given we have the LEB128 support, how about using that here - would both support arbitrarily long counts; and would use fewer than 8 bytes per collection count?

Line:221, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> I'll check on that front, suspect i've been here - comments are needed for sure as Chris asked a question around this area.

Line:2471, engines/ep/src/couch-kvstore/couch-kvstore.cc -> Good call
