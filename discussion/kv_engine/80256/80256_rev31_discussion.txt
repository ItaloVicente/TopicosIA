DESCRIPTION:

MB-22960 / MB-25056: Set pendingBackfill to true when backfill required

Due to cursor dropping we re-register the replication cursor only
during backfill when we mark the disk snapshot.  However by this point
it is possible that the CheckpointManager no longer contains the next
sequence number the replication stream requires (i.e. next one after
the backfill seqnos).

To avoid this data loss when we register the cursor we check to see if
the result is greater than the lastProcessedSeqno + 1.  If so we know
we may have missed some items and may need to perform another backfill.

We actually only need to do another backfill if the result is greater
than the lastProcessedSeqno + 1 and registerCursorBySeqno returns true,
indicating that the resulting seqno starts with the first item on a
checkpoint.

The patch set pendingBackfill as required, and enables / provides the
appropriate regression tests.

Line:654, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> You can simplify this to:

 resp.reset(mock_stream->next());

(same below).

Line:342, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> nit: redraft comment

Line:332, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> This lambda is pretty big, it isn't clear when your reading the depths of it that you're in a function (and not in MB22960_cursor_dropping_data_loss)

Can the lambda be moved to its own function

Line:339, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> this kind of reads odd to me, I know in general we try an keep the exepected value on the left for EXPECT_EQ tests (because gtest will print a message saying expected:a), but what i would of expected to see here (given line 340 tests registerCursorCount to be 0) is "expect registerCursorCount less than or equal to 1", the greater than test threw me when i read the next line checking for 0.

Could this be switched to use EXPECT_LE or the comment updating?

Line:342, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> good spot - thanks

Line:332, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Done

Line:339, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> have changed to EXPECT_LE and swapped the arguments around.

Line:654, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> good point - thanks
