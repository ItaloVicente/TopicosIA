DESCRIPTION:

MB-22960 / MB-25056: Set pendingBackfill to true when backfill required

Due to cursor dropping we re-register the replication cursor only
during backfill when we mark the disk snapshot.  However by this point
it is possible that the persistence cursor has moved ahead.  This would
mean we would lose data when we switch over to in-memory streaming from
backfilling.

To avoid this data loss when we register the cursor we check to see if
the result minus one is greater than the requested starting seqno.  If
so we know we may have missed some items and may need to perform
another backfill.

The reason for the minus one is that registerCursorBySeqno returns the
bySeqno with which the cursor can start and therefore we want to ensure
the previous end is not greater than the requested starting seqno.

We actually only need to do another backfill if the result minus one
is greater than the requested starting seqno and registerCursorBySeqno
returns true, indicating that the resulting seqno starts with the first
item on a checkpoint.

The patch set pendingBackfill as required, and enables / provides the
appropriate regression tests.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> This may be true, but it's not the crux of the issue - it's more that the CheckpointManager may no longer contain the next sequence number needed following the disk backfill.

While the CheckpointManager guarantees that seqnos >= persistenceCursor are always available, but the corollary is not true - the CheckpointManager *may* still have seqnos < persistenceCursor available, if it's not deleted those checkpoints yet. As such, it's more accurate to say something like:

> However by this point it is possible that the CheckpointManager no longer contains the next sequence number the replication stream requires (i.e. next one after the backfill seqnos).

Line:395, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> This whole "-1" thing I feel is pretty confusing. I think it would be better if you re-wrote it in terms of the next required sequence number; and renamed startBySeqno to say "lastProcessedSeqno" - something like:

 void ActiveStream::registerCursor(CheckpointManager& chkptmgr,
                                  uint64_t lastProcessedSeqno) {

 uint64_t nextRequiredSeqno = lastProcessedSeqno + 1;
 ...
 if (result.first > nextRequiredSeqno && ...) {

Line:216, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> Probably worth renaming `callback` to something more descriptive now we have a second `callbackAfter`.

Line:382, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> in this else case is it a bug if callbackCount is > 1? I presume you expect it to be 1 or 0?

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> updated - and also updated the comment in stream.cc

Line:395, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.cc -> Done

Line:216, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_stream.h -> changed to callbackBeforeRegisterCursor and callbackAfterRegisterCursor

Line:382, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> This callback is called after ActiveStream::registerCursor (will rename callbackCount to registerCursorCount) so in the else statement we expect it to be 2.  I will add some expect on what the count should be.
