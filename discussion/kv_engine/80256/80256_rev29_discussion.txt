DESCRIPTION:

MB-22960 / MB-25056: Set pendingBackfill to true when backfill required

Due to cursor dropping we re-register the replication cursor only
during backfill when we mark the disk snapshot.  However by this point
it is possible that the CheckpointManager no longer contains the next
sequence number the replication stream requires (i.e. next one after
the backfill seqnos).

To avoid this data loss when we register the cursor we check to see if
the result is greater than the lastProcessedSeqno + 1.  If so we know
we may have missed some items and may need to perform another backfill.

We actually only need to do another backfill if the result is greater
than the lastProcessedSeqno + 1 and registerCursorBySeqno returns true,
indicating that the resulting seqno starts with the first item on a
checkpoint.

The patch set pendingBackfill as required, and enables / provides the
appropriate regression tests.

Line:1040, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Nit: this is unnecessary, you could just do `"key0"`

Fix looks good; some suggestions for clearer code.
Line:360, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> Maybe expand to clarify what the result of this function is?

Line:519, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Clearer to say "incorrectly" ?

Line:549, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Style: It's often easier to start with the bucket in active, populate, flip to replica, and then setup the DCP stream etc. That means you use the simpler store_item() method to add items.

Line:646, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> More robust to call the variant of runNextTask where you specify the Task name.

Line:651, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Style: you can assign the result of next() to a unique_ptr<DcpResponse>, then you don't have to worry about delete.

Line:653, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Similary here, I'd verify the value of the response you're getting off - check it
actually /is/ key1 (that also removes the need for comments - the code becomes self-documenting.

Line:360, engines/ep/src/dcp/stream.h -> Done

Line:1040, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> fixed - and also addressed similar case on line 1037

Line:519, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Done

Line:549, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> In this case it makes it hard to reproduce issue, because switching from active to replica causes entry in the checkpoint i.e. {5,set_vbucket_state,set_vbucket_state}.
So leaving as is.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:549, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/evp_store_single_threaded_test.cc -> Ok, makes sense.
