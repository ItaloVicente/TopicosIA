DESCRIPTION:

MB-22960 / MB-25056: Set pendingBackfill to true when backfill required

 Due to cursor dropping we re-register the replication cursor only
 during backfill when we mark the disk snapshot.  However by this point
 it is possible that the persistence cursor has moved ahead.  This
 would mean we would lose data when we switch over to in-memory
 streaming from backfilling.

To avoid this data loss when we register the cursor we check to see if
the result minus one is greater than the requested starting seqno.  If
so we know we may have missed some items and may need to perform
another backfill.

The reason for the minus one is that registerCursorBySeqno returns the
bySeqno with which the cursor can start and therefore we want to ensure
the previous end is not greater than the requested starting seqno.

We actually only need to do another backfill if the result minus one
is greater than the requested starting seqno and registerCursorBySeqno
returns true, indicating that the resulting seqno starts with the first
item on a checkpoint.

The patch set pendingBackfill as required, and enables / provides the
appropriate regression tests.
