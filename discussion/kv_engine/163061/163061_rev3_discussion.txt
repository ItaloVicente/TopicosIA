DESCRIPTION:

stats connection self may be run directly in the callback

We have access to the connection object directly in the cookie
callback so we don't need all of the extra complexity of trying
to start a new task, iterate over all of the connections to locate
the correct connection object etc.

Line:284, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> I guess the only advantage to current approach is if it's particulary costly to generate the JSON description; and hence we can avoid holding up the front-end thread (and any other Connections associated with it)?

Line:284, daemon/protocol/mcbp/stats_context.cc -> the current approach also aquire the mutex for the connections (blocks out all establishment and disconnect of clients) until we've iterated over all of the connections trying to look up the connection with the socket descriptor).

I found this as part of trying to flip over to Folly as the backend and it accepted the new socket _BEFORE_ deleting the old object (the socket was closed, but we keep the id around) and then I got the stats for the _previous_ object with the same socket descriptor..

nice 😊

Assuming the cost of toJSON() is low; then this looks fine.
