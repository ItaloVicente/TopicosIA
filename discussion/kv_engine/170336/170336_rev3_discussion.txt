DESCRIPTION:

MB-50647: Remove AtomicQueue

AtomicQueue was reintroduced after memory accounting issues were found
when using folly::UMPMCQueue for ConnMap::pendingNotifications (see
MB-50546).

Now ConnMap::pendingNotifications has been entirely removed,
AtomicQueue can once again be removed.

AtomicQueue has a limit to how many threads can interact with it over
its lifetime (including threads that have since been destroyed).
