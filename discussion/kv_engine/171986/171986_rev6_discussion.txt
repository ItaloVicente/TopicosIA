DESCRIPTION:

MB-51105: Stop ActiveStream from sending non WeaklyMonotonic snapStart

Problem:
MB-51105 showed that just after a rebalance of a cluster, a KV node
would crash when trying to process data for a collection filtered
stream. Due to ActiveStream::nextSnapStart throwing as it's
WeaklyMonotonic property has been violated.

Cause:
This crash is due to a checkpoint within a recently promoted active
node, having an incorrect snapshot range (see figure 1, checkpoint
id:3).

This happens when the following steps occur (referring to figure 1):
1. An active vbucket has a number of documents on disk (e.g. up to
   seqno 11, seqno 11 -> 16 in memory).
2. Then a replica connects and wants to stream 0 -> +inf, e.g.
   send the replica a snapshot[0,16].
3. Then writes come into the active, stored in memory in
   checkpoint id:2 (current checkpoint snap range [12,21]). And we send
   a snapshotMarker ([17,21]) with a checkpoint flag. As it's the first
   items from in memory.
4. Then more mutations come in which we send a snapshot marker e.g
   ([22, 26] & [27,31]), without a checkpoint marker flag as its still
   part of the last checkpoint.
5. NS-Server then closes the stream, to start a takeover stream from
   the high seqno of the active vbucket. At this point we change the
   topology of the Active two times which causes us to add two
   set_vbucket_state items, with the first one causing us to close
   the checkpoint and the second in a new checkpoint (at seqno 32).
6. The takeover stream moves the replica to the pending state, but
   before moving it from pending to active. The original active
   receives mutations.
7. **THE BUG**: At this point the active process the mutations in
   ActiveStream::processItems() to send a snapshot. However, while
   doing this we register our cursor on the first active
   set_vbucket_state (at seqno 32). Which causes us to pick up the
   first in memory's snapshot range (see step 3). Which we then use
   for this snapshot's start seqno (so we end up sending [12, 33] as
   can be seen at checkpoint id:3 in figure 1).
   ***We've now poisoned the replica**
8. The take over stream the moves the replica from pending to active.
9. Then a collection only DCP client comes along and streams some of
   the items from the vbucket. We send the items for the collection
   from the disk snapshot. Then we move to send data from the memory
   checkpoints. At this point we set the ActiveStream::nextSnapStart
   when ever we see a new checkpoint start. This causes us to set it's
   value from 17 then 12 causing us to beak nextSnapStart's
   WeaklyMonotonic property causing us to throw and crash.

Fix:
To fix this bug we need to ensure that we don't use Snapshot range from
previous checkpoints. To do this every time we see a checkpoint_end item
during ActiveStream::processItems(), remove the head of the
OutstandingItemsResult::ranges, ensuring that the current head's end
seqno is < the queue_op::checkpoint_end's seqno.
