DESCRIPTION:

MB-25342: Don't update revision on a delete

Collections are identified by a name and to support (fast) re-creation
of deleted collections internally by name:rev. The current code on
delete was changing the revision we store for the collection to match
whatever manifest informed us of the delete, this is not correct and
prevents full clean-up of a deleted collection (not full clean-up of
a collection is not supported yet).

Full clean-up in this context means deletion of all items belonging
to the deleted collection and any system-events we persisted which
"mark" the collection in the seqno index.

To re-cap on collection creation we have stored a system event which
says "collection X created with revision n", that information is
in the key of the system event.

Thus to delete that key in the future we must retain the revision of
the deleted collection when we start deletion.
