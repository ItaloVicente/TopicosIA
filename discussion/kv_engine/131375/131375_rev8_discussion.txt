DESCRIPTION:

MB-39532: Tolerate a collection being re-created

Remove an exception from the collection state flusher so that we
allow a collection to be in both drop and open lists.

This has the effect of fixing crashes seen in the MB but is also
how flush of a collection is intended to work.

Collections have an associated seqno (the seqno at which they were
created). The isLogicallyDeleted function which decides if a key
is dropped (because the collection was dropped) has always used the
collection-ID and seqno for evaluating the result. In the flush case
a collection's start seqno would effectively move to vbucket-high
meaning all existing document's of the collection are dropped, but
new documents can be added. With this always being the design, the
exception was incorrect and can be removed.
