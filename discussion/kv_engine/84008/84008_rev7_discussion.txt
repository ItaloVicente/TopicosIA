DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Move to bufferevent [1/n]

This patch moves the memcached core over to using bufferevents
for it's network layer (for plain and SSL communication).

To reduce the size of the patch we've disabled some functionality:

* Disable fair sharing by backing off after processing n
  events
* Disable idle timers

And we're not doing any large refactoring to the buffer
handling in memcached which would grow the patch. That
means that we're currently doing double buffering by
copying the data between our read/write buffers and
the buffers already used by bufferevents.
