DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Move to bufferevent [1/n]

This patch moves the memcached core over to using bufferevents
for it's network layer (for plain and SSL communication).

To reduce the size of the patch we've disabled some functionality:

* Disable fair sharing by backing off after processing n
  events
* Disable idle timers

And we're not doing any large refactoring to the buffer
handling in memcached which would grow the patch. That
means that we're currently doing double buffering by
copying the data between our read/write buffers and
the buffers already used by bufferevents.

Mostly looks good. Few minor comments.
Line:879, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Are there not similar statistics we can ask of the bufferevent API? these kinds of stats have been very useful in the past; would be good if we could replace with something similar.

Line:45, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Style: If you make these two functions static member functions of McbpConnection; you can then make `on_data_received()` and `on_data_sent()` private; reducing the surface area of the class.

Line:52, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Same.

Line:114, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> I think it would be cleaner to just delete this (given it's not compiled in anyways), and maybe leave a TODO. You can always look in the git history to see what it used to do...

Line:202, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> everything

Line:209, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Add @todo?

Line:215, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Shouldn't we also set `res` to a negative value here?

Line:298, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> @todo?

Line:895, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Do we need to check if it's enabled? Can't we just unconditionally call bufferevent_disable?

Line:901, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Same question here.

Line:757, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> Add a `@todo` tag?

Line:757, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> bufferevent

Line:886, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> Add @todo?

Line:77, daemon/memcached.cc -> Nit: Technically we should use the C++ variants of these (<cstdio>, <cstdlib>, etc) which would mean they would sort correctly automatically (go with <algorighm> and <vector> below).

Line:328, daemon/statemachine_mcbp.cc -> Same comment as previous - I think it's best to delete the code (leaving a todo).

Line:397, daemon/statemachine_mcbp.cc -> Suggest an exception or similar to enforce this.

Line:879, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> i can add a todo to insert new internal stats once we're done.

Line:45, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Done

Line:52, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Done

Line:114, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Done

Line:202, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Done

Line:209, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> Done

Line:215, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> no... we return -1 unless res is of a positive value (line 226)

Line:298, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> done

Line:895, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> The documentation doesn't specify if it is possible or not.

Line:901, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> ditto

Line:757, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> Done

Line:886, daemon/connection_mcbp.h -> Done

Line:77, daemon/memcached.cc -> This is thanks to the limitations of clang-format. I added a single header, and it rearranged all of them. Is there a way to fix clang-format to only mess around with lines actually being changed?

Line:328, daemon/statemachine_mcbp.cc -> Done

Line:397, daemon/statemachine_mcbp.cc -> Done

Line:215, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> So the previous code would fail (and return -1 from the method) if any individual write failed (line 350). In your new code; you just break from the for() loop without modifying `res`; therefore the function will return whatever the total so far of bytes written is; surpassing the error.

If that change in behaviour is desired; then ok; but we should document that in the header.

Line:77, daemon/memcached.cc -> IIRC it'll only change the paragraph you're editing; but sooner or later if the header order is wrong we'll need to fix it.

Line:215, daemon/connection_mcbp.cc -> If you look at the old code it behaves exactly like this does.. it does increment res every time we successfully send some data. if one of the individual write fails, we'll return the number of bytes we've sent so far.. if we haven't sent anything we'll return -1..

Line:77, daemon/memcached.cc -> Sure, but it does increase the diff.. And I don't think it's correct to go through replacing unrelated includes as part of another patch
