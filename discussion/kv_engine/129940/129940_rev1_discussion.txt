DESCRIPTION:

MB-37009: DcpProducer::handleResponce, don't disconnect on KeyEnoent

DcpProducer shouldn't disconnect on status code
cb::mcbp::Status::KeyEnoent. As this is returned by
DcpConsumer::lookupStreamAndDispatchMessage(), when it can't find a
stream for the vbucket the op is for. This can occur during rebalance
and thus we don't want to tear down all the streams because its likely a
vbucket is being moved to another node or has changed state. However, we
do need to disconnect for DCP durability ops (Prepare, Abort, Commit)
as KeyEnoent is used to indicate something more more serious has
happened e.g. a DCP_COMMIT can't find the matching prepare.
