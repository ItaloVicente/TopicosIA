DESCRIPTION:

MB-44079: Dump full ADM at State::updateHighCompletedSeqno()

Extra logging has been recently added for dumping the ADM::State in case
of error, but the resolvedQueue is an ADM member. Add the resolveQueue
to the dump. Note that currently we print only the size of the queue as
the underlying type (folly::USPSCQueue) public API exposes only
enqueue/dequeue.

I was looking for that, but the underlying folly::USPSCQueue public API provides only enqueue/dequeue. Commit message updated.

Ahh okay. There's highEnqueuedSeqno too which might help
