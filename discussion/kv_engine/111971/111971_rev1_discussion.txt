DESCRIPTION:

MB-39410: Track Passive HPS/HCS in member variables

For a simpler warmup (and even state transition) if the
HPS and HCS are tracked as variables of the
PassiveDurabilityMonitor's state object they can simple
be assigned to from the warmup state.

This commit adds the variables only and maintains them
from existing PDM methods.
