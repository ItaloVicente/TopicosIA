DESCRIPTION:

Remove checkpoint re-use optimization in CheckpointManager

Removed the ability of the CheckpointManager to re-use empty
checkpoint. Which will help us to make more of the checkpoint immutable
in the future patches. This will help us to better reason about the
state of a checkpoint and what are valid transitions for snapshot
ranges.

Due to us now sometimes creating empty checkpoints in
some unit test, this patch also make amendments to multiple tests.

(6 comments)
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Maybe give a bit more context here on why this optimisation exists and when it currently kicks in.

Line:660, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Didn't understand this comment "max checkpoint items" - could you expand / re-word?

Line:1049, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> I think this is probably a good example of not making tests overly specific. I don't think the code here cares exactly how many checkpoints exist, all it cares about it that the number doesn't change when mutationns are processed, but it does change when a snapshot marker comes along. 

Give you need to change the numbers anyway, I'd do something like read the number of checkpoints which exist at this point and store in a variable, then change the explicit EXPECTS() below to simply check for that same number, then at line 1082 check it's that initial checkpoint count +1.

Line:1820, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Given this is a common pattern, suggest creating a helper function, something like "advanceCursorToEndOfCheckpoints" - in fact check with Paolo as I think he might have added something very similar recently.

Line:2570, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> This seems related to / conflicts with  Paolo's eager / lazy checkpoint changes - might want to check with him.

Line:2809, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Comment needs updating.

Line:2570, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> Also note, that call that we would actually need here is to move cursors, not removing checkpoints.

Line:2570, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> This will conflict either patch preventing us breaking the text if both where to get +2ed at the same time. Think the fix long term is Paolo's but this change is need first if this patch gets in first.
