DESCRIPTION:

Remove checkpoint re-use optimization in CheckpointManager

Removed the ability of the CheckpointManager to re-use empty
checkpoint. Which could occur when a replica vbucket received a
snapshot and the current open checkpoint had no items in it. This
could occur after a CheckpointManager had been created but nothing
had been added to the checkpoint, or a old active flipped to being
a replica but it's open checkpoint didn't have any non meta items
in it.

This will help us to make more of the checkpoint immutable
in the future patches. This will help us to better reason about the
state of a checkpoint and what are valid transitions for snapshot
ranges.

Due to us now sometimes creating empty checkpoints in
some unit test, this patch also make amendments to multiple tests.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Also, we should probably raise an MB for this as it might be something we want to defer to in release notes etc - or at the last tag with the same MB you're using for the CheckpointManger additional const-ification / invariants checks...
Line:321, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Not clear why there's three checkpoints here, the comments above only refer to 2.

Line:327, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Comment needs updating.

Line:376, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Again, comment needs updating here, and probably the above comments about 1st and 2nd snapshot need updating also.

Line:379, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Did you consider changing where `cursor` is registered in the SetUp method - i.e. say just calling getItemsForCursor() there to "consume" the items you are now skipping everywhere?

That might simplify the changes needed for this test...

Line:4598, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Style: You can achieve the same thing in a more terse (and readable) fashion via:

 EXPECT_THAT(outItems.items,
             testing::ElementsAre(HasOperation(queue_op::checkpoint_start),
                                  HasOperation(queue_op::checkpoint_end));

Line:4779, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Could you do the same pattern as per line 5020?

Line:4858, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> As above, given you're (mostly) just checking for the operation, you could replace most of this with:

 EXPECT_THAT(outItems.items,
             testing::ElementsAre(HasOperation(queue_op::checkpoint_start),
                                  HasOperation(queue_op::checkpoint_end),
                                  ...);

Then just check the seqno of that one element you are checking.

Line:5277, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Please explain why this extra step is needed for ephemeral.

Line:379, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> doing it in the setup won't quite work as it will affect tests that don't treat the checkpoint manager as a replica by using createSnapshot(), Though probably makes sense to create a sub set of test that call advanceCursorToEndOfCheckpoints() in the setup

Line:4598, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_durability_stream_test.cc -> Thanks for the heads up
