DESCRIPTION:

Remove checkpoint re-use optimization in CheckpointManager

Removed the ability of the CheckpointManager to re-use empty
checkpoint. Which could occur when a replica vbucket received a
snapshot and the current open checkpoint had no items in it. This could
after a CheckpointManager had been created but nothing had been added to
the checkpoint, or a old active flipped to being a replica but didn't
but it's open checkpoint didn't have any non meta items in it.

This will help us to make more of the checkpoint immutable
in the future patches. This will help us to better reason about the
state of a checkpoint and what are valid transitions for snapshot
ranges.

Due to us now sometimes creating empty checkpoints in
some unit test, this patch also make amendments to multiple tests.

 This could occur after

Line:1055, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> You're expecting id=2 actually, either comment or assertion is wrong :)

Line:1056, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Style: We use to write _EQ(expectedValue, expression) - I'm not a fan of that but it makes sense to keep consistent style

Line:2572, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> Why 2 calls?

Line:337, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> could flip to using post-increment so "index++" is visibly the last time a given index is checked, rather than "++index" being the first time a new index is checked

Or, though it's a bit more verbose, when multiple lines check the same index it could be

    EXPECT_EQ(queue_op::mutation, items.at(index)->getOperation());
    EXPECT_EQ(1003, items.at(index)->getBySeqno());
    ++index;
    
to make it easier to see at a glance when we've moved to the next item.

Could possibly even move this into a helper checking the operation, and optionally the seqno.


Butttt - this is just a stylistic thing and is somewhat tangential to the actual patch, so might not be worth changing right now

Line:2198, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Have these tests already been moved to `eager` checkpoint removal? I'd have thought with `lazy` expelling tests would fail with the old checkpoint lingering.

Though if the test passes it's obviously handling it fine, so that might be the answer for me :P

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:337, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> My angle was not to be too intrusive when changing this test but also so that one doesn't need to lock it down per index. I think ultimately its still readable and ensures the test does what it's meant too.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2198, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/checkpoint_test.cc -> Think it's enabled by default so I would assume so, it's probably not being removed due to the cursor still being on it.
