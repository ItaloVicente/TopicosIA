DESCRIPTION:

MB-35543: Add (basic) unit tests for durability requests

Add basic tests to verify that we can add durability
requirements to all of the commands who supports durability.

We can't enable all of the tests yet due to:

MB-35546: delete don't return the correct CAS
MB-35548: TOUCH and GAT returns NOT SUPPORTED for durable
          requests.
