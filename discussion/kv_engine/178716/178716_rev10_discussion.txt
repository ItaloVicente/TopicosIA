Line:95, include/memcached/config_parser.h -> How does the caller know how many elements are in here? null-terminated?

(Given you're already changing the API might be nicer to change to gsl::span<items> which knows it's own size).

Line:18, utilities/config_parser.cc -> API is not very C++ idiomatic here - we both modify the input param (str), and return it from the function.

Prefer to either:

a) leave the input unmodified (say passing as string_view) and return the resulting trimmed part, or

b) modify the input but return void so it's more obvious how the data is changed.

(Personally I'd go with (a)).

Line:27, utilities/config_parser.cc -> trim_left() from boost string algorithms can do this - see https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/doc/html/boost/algorithm/trim_left.html

Line:89, utilities/config_parser.cc -> Doesn't this loose support for negative numbers (we are not using std::stoll() anymore...)

Line:104, utilities/config_parser.cc -> boost to_lower (or the copy variant if you prefer) https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/doc/html/boost/algorithm/to_lower.html 

or  
https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_80_0/doc/html/string_algo/reference.html#header.boost.algorithm.string.case_conv_hpp

Line:153, utilities/config_parser.cc -> Don't we want to at least log this - to maintain the same behaviour as before?

Line:156, utilities/config_parser.cc -> Ditto

Line:164, utilities/config_parser.cc -> Style: unnecessary comparison to nullptr.

Line:154, utilities/config_parser_test.cc -> Shouldn't we be calling value_as_ssize_t() here?

Line:95, include/memcached/config_parser.h -> It was added just as a wrapper (and could be static inside the config_parser.cc). I wanted to flip the internals over to use std::string_view first and not have to worry about all callers as that would make the patch too big..

This method is nuked in the next patch

Line:18, utilities/config_parser.cc -> So your comment is _almost_ correct.. we return a _modified_ version of the part we remove from the field.. I could split this into 3 different tasks:

1. pick out the next field
2. remove it frokm the input field
3. trim the next field by removing escape's and leading/trailing space.

I can always rewrite that into 3 different methods and then create a new method which calls all 3 which is the one I'm going to need in all cases...

This isn't a "general purpose" method so I'd prefer to just stick with the current one..

Line:27, utilities/config_parser.cc -> it didn't like the std::string_view.. the common case is no leading (or trailing) whitespace and we're only parsing a configuration as part of bucket create and delete so we don't really need a huge optimization here..

Line:89, utilities/config_parser.cc -> ooops...

Line:104, utilities/config_parser.cc -> Not sure what the win is? looks like we only introduce an external dependency?

Line:153, utilities/config_parser.cc -> caller provides the callback

Line:156, utilities/config_parser.cc -> ditto

Line:164, utilities/config_parser.cc -> It will be killed in the next version

Line:154, utilities/config_parser_test.cc -> Done

Line:27, utilities/config_parser.cc -> :( Looks like a known issue: https://groups.google.com/g/boost-developers-archive/c/m3UzDU9zFfg

Line:104, utilities/config_parser.cc -> we already depend on boost (and algorithm is header-only IIRC) - what we gain is simply not implementing our own version of common algorithms.

Line:153, utilities/config_parser.cc -> Ah yes, I misread :(

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:104, utilities/config_parser.cc -> std::transform _is_ part of the C++ library so its not like we're implementing something new (and we have the same logic elsewhere in our codebase already)

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:104, utilities/config_parser.cc -> True, although boost::to_lower is slightly simpler...
