DESCRIPTION:

MB-30552: Add test for correct log formatting of Vbid

Added a test to ensure that Vbid logs correctly, along with a fix
to make that actually happen. <spdlog/fmt/ostr.h> is needed to
output custom types, however having this in vbucket.cc allows the
implicit call of Vbid to uint16_t to take presidence and ignore
the formatting. By including it in the appropriate locations,
this issue can be avoided. This also removes the need to have a
seperate vbucket.cc file.

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> conversion

Line:22, engines/ep/src/bucket_logger.h -> We should try to minimise header inclusion - if a file doesn't want/need to use fmtlib to print a custom type, it shouldn't need to #include ostr.h

This pulls in a bunch of fmt unnecessarily into the interface of bucket_logger.h. At the very least move this to Vbid.h (for now while you have the implicit conversion operator to uint16_t); when you remove that operator you can relocate this header where necessary.

Line:121, include/memcached/vbucket.h -> I'd keep this non-inline - formatting code isn't really performance critical and hence we should just keep in the .cc file.
