DESCRIPTION:

MB-26470: Notifier stream to hold only a weak_ptr to producer conn

Currently active stream holds a shared_ptr to its producer
(notifier) conn and the producer conn holds shared_ptr to all its
notifier streams. When a DcpConnMap is deleted without explicitly
closing all its connections, there is a cyclic reference between
producer conn and its streams.

Hence, this commit converts the shared_ptr (to producer) held by
the notifier stream to weak_ptr. It also adds a test case that
demonstrates the memory when run with address sanitizer.
