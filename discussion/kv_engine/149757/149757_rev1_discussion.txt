DESCRIPTION:

Fix CouchstoreFileAccessGuard() on Windows

Currently CouchstoreFileAccessGuard() doesn't work as intended when used
in DenyAll mode. This is due to the fact that chmod() on Windows works
by modifying the files attributes, but on Windows there is no attribute
that states if a user can read a file only an attribute to make it
read-only. Instead Windows implements this functionality using ACL's
(Access control lists) however, to access these they require verbose
code. So instead simply create an exclusive handle to the file for the
lifetime of the CouchstoreFileAccessGuard() when in the DenyAll mode.
