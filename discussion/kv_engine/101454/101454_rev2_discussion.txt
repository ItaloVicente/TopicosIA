DESCRIPTION:

MB-31907: [2/2] Persist and replicate scope events

Update the VB::Manifest so that it can queue a system
event when a scope is created or dropped, this system
event is very similar to collection create/drop.

The patch also updates the filter code so that a stream
which is scope filtered closes when the scope is removed.
