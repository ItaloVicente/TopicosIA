DESCRIPTION:

MB-31907: [2/2] Persist and replicate scope events

Update the VB::Manifest so that it can queue a system
event when a scope is created or dropped, this system
event is very similar to collection create/drop.

The patch also updates the filter code so that a stream
which is scope filtered closes when the scope is removed.

Line:298, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_filter.cc -> In processCollectionEvent we only send events in passthrough mode if the client has not observed them yet (See line 271-275). Seems like we should be doing the same thing for scope events.

Line:318, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_filter.cc -> Why do we need this instead of just emptying the collections in the filter?

Line:869, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.cc -> Per our chat, can you make this clearer that you can't shrink the flatbuffers data so we just have to overwrite the value

Line:1130, engines/ep/src/collections/vbucket_manifest.h -> Pretty sure std::set sorts on insertion by key so it won't maintain insertion order. Think we need an extra test that deletes a scope in the middle of those the vBucket knows about

Line:299, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/collections_dcp_test.cc -> Could check key in same way as collection drop event (line 277)

Line:1002, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/collections/evp_store_collections_dcp_test.cc -> nit: comment needs updating
