Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This bug id isn't public so it should be replaced with an MB.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> This isn't of much value to this commit ;-)

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's off by default and needs to be explicitly enabled

-1  for the memory quota defaulting to a fixed value internally if "0.0" is used.

Also - do you want to enable EP_USE_MAGMA in KV-Engine commit validation yet? (So this code can be defended)?
Line:1022, engines/ep/configuration.json -> That doesn't seem very useful from a KV-Engine pov - I would suggest that magma always takes the value we pass down to it.

Line:186, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Note: You'll need to add support later down the line for dynamically changing the quota (as the bucket quota changes).

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I did not know that's a problem. So to confirm, for all changes that are associated with a sprint board ticket, we need to create corresponding MB and use that?

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Agreed, will remove.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Sorry the comment is correct, but magma needs to be enabled by default.

Line:1022, engines/ep/configuration.json -> Done

Line:186, engines/ep/src/magma-kvstore/magma-kvstore.cc -> Thanks Dave, I will make a note of this as a TODO.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> It won't break CE at least not currently. In fact for the commit validation magma repo isn't even available. The purpose of this commit is to have the API stubs ready to help with future rebase in case kvstore API changes again. In this commit magma is not pulled in. In the next commit once magma gets pulled in we will conditionally disable magma based on build type as we do for other such projects today.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yeah, similar to how CBSEs shouldn’t be used for code commits as they arn’t public so impossible to follow what the actual issue is in the public tracker.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Technically it’s true it won’t currently break as you arn’t linking magma yet, *but* the intent of EP_USE_MAGMA should be if magma is used (and hence linked) - just like how forestry / RocksDB is handled. 

It seems pretty pointless to enable it here, then to disable in the next commit. Just make it set based on ENTERPRISE=1 by default.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> Trond is correct - magma needs to be off by default otherwise you’ll break the CE build. At the very least you need to only enable it if Enterprise=true
