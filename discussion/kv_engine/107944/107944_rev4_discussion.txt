DESCRIPTION:

MB-33852: Fix NOT_STORED being returned from arithmetic op

(Backport of MB-33813 to 5.5.x).

Currently we are returning NOT_STORED when bucket_store()
returns ENGINE_NOT_STORED. This is due to a race condition
when a key of the same name as this arithmetic operation is stored
between ArithmeticCommandContext::getItem() calling bucket_get()
and ArithmeticCommandContext::storeNewItem() calling bucket_store().
Thus, causing the bucket_store() to fail. In this case we should
handle this.

To fix this, this patch resets the ArithmeticCommandContext
state machine by calling changing the state to Reset. When
we see ENGINE_NOT_STORED returned to
ArithmeticCommandContext::storeNewItem() by bucket_store().

This patch also adds a unit test to check that we return
ENGINE_SUCCESS and that we correctly re-try the arithmetic
operation.
