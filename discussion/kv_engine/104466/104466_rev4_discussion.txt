DESCRIPTION:

MB-31810: Track the persisted high seqno of system events

Currently, we do not track the high seqno of collection events
in the collections persisted high seqno. Track the high seqno of
these events by decoding the collection ID from the system event
key, and updating the appropriate collection's persisted high
seqno.

There exists a special case that must be dealt with. If an active
node has a collection tombstone, and is streaming to a replica that
has no knowledge of the collection, then it is possible to not find
the manifest entry corresponding to the collection (i.e. a fresh
replica). In this case, we should not throw an exception if we
cannot find the collection, we should just continue.

Line:33, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.cc -> I think this function mostly already does what you need getCollectionIDFromKey (the key must be from a system event with type Collection).

I wonder if the two can be merged or if you can make use of the existing ones

Line:37, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.cc -> You should be able to do this with std::search, that would avoid creating the temporary string from strippedKeyData

Line:33, engines/ep/src/collections/collections_types.cc -> Forgot they existed, used them instead but threw in an optional separator parameter so that I can specify more specifically the CollectionSystemEventPrefix and throw on any non-collection SystemEvents
