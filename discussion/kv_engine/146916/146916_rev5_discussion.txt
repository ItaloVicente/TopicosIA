DESCRIPTION:

Optimize send buffer use

Calculate the total number of bytes we want to send for an
individual response and and ask bufferevent to allocate the
space (in an iovector) at the same time.

Previously we would use a number of calls to bufferevent_write
to write the individual parts of a packet and each of these
calls would then result in (potentially) allocating new buffers.
To work around the problem for the headers we would first copy
everything into the front end threads scratch buffer, before
using bufferevent_write with the header extras and key and then
a second call with the value.

We may use bufferevent a bit more optimal by calculating the
total amount of data we're going to send and then request (at
at least) this amount of memory to become available in an
iovector. The first entry of the iovector will be "the current
tail chunk" and the second entry is a new buffer which is big
enough to hold the remaining data.

Is there an MB associated with this (the DCP perf MB?)
Line:1137, daemon/connection.cc -> By passing a gsl::span in you can also turn this into a simple for loop over the elements in the span

Line:376, daemon/connection.h -> gsl::span<std::string_view> is probably a cleaner and more generic solution - i.e. a non-owning view on a sequence of string_view objects,

Line:94, include/memcached/dcp_stream_id.h -> To avoid duplication nice to just implement one of these in terms of the other (getBuf / getBuffer).

Its not directly linked towards an MB (it would be the initial bufferevent one if any). It'll be used in more or less all operations and not just DCP.
Line:1137, daemon/connection.cc -> Done

Line:376, daemon/connection.h -> Due to the problems on the "call site" having to build up an std::array there I'll just leave this in as a convenience method from within the core for now until gsl::span gets fixed

Line:94, include/memcached/dcp_stream_id.h -> Done
