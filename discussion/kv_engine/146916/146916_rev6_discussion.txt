DESCRIPTION:

Optimize send buffer use

Calculate the total number of bytes we want to send for an
individual response and and ask bufferevent to allocate the
space (in an iovector) at the same time.

Previously we would use a number of calls to bufferevent_write
to write the individual parts of a packet and each of these
calls would then result in (potentially) allocating new buffers.
To work around the problem for the headers we would first copy
everything into the front end threads scratch buffer, before
using bufferevent_write with the header extras and key and then
a second call with the value.

We may use bufferevent a bit more optimal by calculating the
total amount of data we're going to send and then request (at
at least) this amount of memory to become available in an
iovector. The first entry of the iovector will be "the current
tail chunk" and the second entry is a new buffer which is big
enough to hold the remaining data.

Line:1136, daemon/connection.cc -> Now there's a simple for-loop, not sure the complexity of the lambda above (including modifying captured values) is worth it - can just inline the lambda contents into here.

Line:397, daemon/connection.h -> Note you're always constructing a 5-element span here; so there's more work in copyToOutputStream to actually manipulate the empty elements. 

If you want a maximally simple API to use and efficiency, better to create 5 different overloads (assuming we actually need to send 5 chunks of data at once?):

 copyToOutputStream(std::string_view data1, std::string_view data2) {
     std::string_view data[] = {data1, data2};
     copyToOutputStream(data);
 } 
 copyToOutputStream(std::string_view data1,
                    std::string_view data2,
                    std::string_view data3) {
     std::string_view data[] = {data1, data2, data3};
     copyToOutputStream(data);
 } 
 ...

Line:1136, daemon/connection.cc -> Done

Line:397, daemon/connection.h -> I'm aware of that, but in most of the cases we'll call it with 3 or 4 parameters (4 for all normal operations operating on items < 4k) so I'm not sure if we're really able to measure any runtime overhead of pushing 1-2 unused entries into that array....

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:397, daemon/connection.h -> True it might be hard to measure; but given this patch is about minimising copying / moving data thought it might be worth to try to make as tight as possible :)
