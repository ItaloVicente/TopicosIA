DESCRIPTION:

MB-53118: Ensure Warmup disk scans process at least 1 item

As part of MB-52383, warmup tasks which read items from disk (key
and/or value scan) yield their running thread after 10ms, to allow
other tasks on the Reader thread pool to execute.

However, if the first item returned from scan takes longer than 10ms,
then the task immediately yields without processing the item. When the
task is next rescheduled it will end up fetching the same item again -
and if _that_ item also takes >10ms to read then it will yield
again. As such, warmup can end up making zero forward progress. This
is particulary likley to occur with slower disks and/or large Buckets,
as the scan will require more disk access than smaller Buckets.

Address this by:

1. Only checking for a yield _after_ we have processed the item.

2. Modifying how yield() is implemented to resume the scan _after_ the
   item which was just scanned - otherwise upon resume we would end up
   scanning the same item again.

This guarantees that at least 1 item will always be processed before
yielding.

Line:414, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> nit: do you mean the first?

Line:414, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> I mean the last.

Consider the case where we perform a scan, and after the 4th item we have only just not reached the limit (say 9.99ms has passed); we continue scanning and process the 5th item, check the limit after it and find 11ms has elapsed - so we need to add some "buffer" to account for this last item.

Line:414, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> But don't we yield after the 5th item has gone though the call back, after this change? So why would we want to try and continue to go further?

Line:414, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Yes, we yield after 5, but by then we have taken _longer_ than the chunk duration to get there.

Line:414, engines/ep/src/warmup.cc -> Apologies I forgot we use maxExpectedDuration() for the logging. I was thinking of it's use in this code before this patch here:https://review.couchbase.org/c/kv_engine/+/178056/4/engines/ep/src/warmup.cc#b502
