DESCRIPTION:

MB-53118: Ensure Warmup disk scans process at least 1 item

As part of MB-52383, warmup tasks which read items from disk (key
and/or value scan) yield their running thread after 10ms, to allow
other tasks on the Reader thread pool to execute.

However, if the first item returned from scan takes longer than 10ms,
then the task immediately yields without processing the item. When the
task is next rescheduled it will end up fetching the same item again -
and if _that_ item also takes >10ms to read then it will yield
again. As such, warmup can end up making zero forward progress. This
is particulary likley to occur with slower disks and/or large Buckets,
as the scan will require more disk access than smaller Buckets.

Address this by:

1. Only checking for a yield _after_ we have processed the item.

2. Modifying how yield() is implemented to resume the scan _after_ the
   item which was just scanned - otherwise upon resume we would end up
   scanning the same item again.

This guarantees that at least 1 item will always be processed before
yielding.
