Few minor things.

Once you've done the pass to remove the unnecessary #includes, it would be interesting to compare the (incremental) build times before and after this change when you say just touch kv_bucket.h. Note you'll need to disable CCACHE (set env var CCACHE_DISABLE=1) to ensure the comparision makes sense.
Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> You're missing a line break here - Git considers everything in the first paragraph as the subject (even if it's on multiple lines).

Line:261, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h -> Style: In C++ it's unnecessary to specify a function which takes zero arguments as `(void)` - you can just use an empty list `()`. For lines where you are already changing them, could you remove the `void` please?

Line:344, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h -> Can you also restore these functions to be inline - they all should meet the requirement of being cheaper to inline than not inline.

Line:357, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h -> Same.

Line:407, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h -> Note: /technically/ you shouldn't really change the whitespace here as we arn't otherwise changing these lines now. 

Having said that; the scope of this patch is relatively large but shallow (we are making simple changes in a large number of places) and this /does/ bring the formatting of these methods to the standard; so in this case given you've already made this change it's ok to leave as-is.
