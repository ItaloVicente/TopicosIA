Couple of comments. Apologies for lack of clarity in the MB about what inlines to remove - best to keep trivial member functions (simple accessors / mutators etc) inline. 

General rule of thumb would be - does making a function non-inline cost /more/ than inlining it? (both compile-time and runtime-costs). 

For example - making an accessor which returns a copy of single scalar member will cost ~minimal at compile time (as the definition of the class must be present); and the runtime cost will be more than simply inline it (inline would be a single `mov` instruction on most archtectures; non-inline would require setup of a function call (push regs to stack; call function; the actual mov and a ret).
Line:28, engines/ep/src/checkpoint.cc -> (here and elsewhere) - is this the minimal required includes or is his still the simple "add kv_bucket.h everywhere ep_engine.h" proposal we discussed?

Line:19, engines/ep/src/dcp/flow-control-manager.cc -> Nit: config.h should *always* be the first header (see https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#include-style) - while that's true currently if might not if you added aaa.h; so please put config.h into its own paragraph.

Line:177, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h -> It's probably better to leave this as inline - it's a trivial accessor method which /doesn't/ require the definition of any external types (i.e. kv_bucket.h) as it just returns a (reference to a) member of the class. As such it would be more expensive to setup the call/return than the actual work it does (copying a simple scalar value)

Similar elsewhere - anything trivial (i.e. 1-2 lines; with no conditional) should probably stay inline. See also: http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#f5-if-a-function-is-very-small-and-time-critical-declare-it-inline).

Line:393, engines/ep/src/ep_engine.h -> All these are probably worth leaving as inline - same for other accessor / mutators which just set / get a member (without any extra logic).
