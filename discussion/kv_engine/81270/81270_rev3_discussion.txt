DESCRIPTION:

MB-25097: In 'fail_new_data' disconnect from processor tsk on full mem

In Ephemeral buckets, with fail_new_data policy, if replication or
rebalance results in a condition wherein there is not enough memory for
data items on the consumer node, then we must fail such a rebalance
or replication rather than hang.

It is possible that the memory usage can be found above the threshold
while we are porcessing the items from the consumer buffer in the
consumer processor task. Upon hitting such a condition, the processor
task stops processing and notifies the DCP consumer to disconnect.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> processing

Line:50, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_dcp_consumer.h -> uint32_t

Line:1959, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> please provide brief summary/overview of what the test is doing.

Line:1992, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> why falsely?

Line:2022, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> stating that setting NumNonIO to zero so Processor task does not run, but then immediately below, wait for the Processor task run to complete??

Line:2024, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> can't we explicitly run the work of the processor task, as opposed to letting it run in the background and waiting for it to complete.  Its cleaner as it does not relying on checking stats to allow test to run.  Instead they can become ASSERTS.

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:50, engines/ep/tests/mock/mock_dcp_consumer.h -> Done

Line:1959, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Done

Line:1992, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Bad wording, removed.

Line:2022, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Wrong comment. After setting the NonIO to 1, the processor task runs

Line:2024, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> I think running as separate threads is more closer to what happens in actual operation time. 

Changed this a bit: that is, the processor thread sets the disconnect status, notifies the consumer conn and sleeps. Consumer conn then comes and closes the conn.
