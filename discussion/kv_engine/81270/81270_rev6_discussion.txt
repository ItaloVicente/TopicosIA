DESCRIPTION:

MB-25097: In 'fail_new_data' disconnect from processor tsk on full mem

In Ephemeral buckets, with fail_new_data policy, if replication or
rebalance results in a condition wherein there is not enough memory for
data items on the consumer node, then we must fail such a rebalance
or replication rather than hang.

It is possible that the memory usage can be found above the threshold
while we are processing the items from the consumer buffer in the
consumer processor task. Upon hitting such a condition, the processor
task stops processing and notifies the DCP consumer to disconnect.

Line:920, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> Style: the control-flow is a bit hard to follow here - you `return` directly from one of the cases (all_processed), but break from the others; however there's an immediate return after the switch. In effect every case is the last thing it does.

As such, suggest you use `break` in all cases, or `return` in all cases (I'll let you determine which is clearer here).

See also: https://github.com/couchbase/kv_engine/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.rst#use-early-exits-and-continue-to-simplify-code

Line:1278, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> This comment is essentially useless - we can see all the streams are being closed from the code, the comment doesn't add any more. Either remove it, or change to explain /why/ the streams are being closed, it necessary.

Line:1281, engines/ep/src/dcp/consumer.cc -> ditto

Line:1985, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Any reason we can't just run the Processor task in the current thread . That simplifies the test as everything is sequential.

See for example: runBGFetcherTask()

Line:1995, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> You'll remove the need for all of this if you run the task synchronously.

Line:2009, engines/ep/tests/module_tests/dcp_test.cc -> Same for all of this - it can be removed if you run the task synchronously.
