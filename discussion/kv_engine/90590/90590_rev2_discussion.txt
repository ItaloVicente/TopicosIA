DESCRIPTION:

Refactor: Use common method to create and connect sockets for tests

We've duplicated the logic on how to create sockets for our
clients in testapp and the test client. Refactor the code
so that we have only a single way we're creating these
sockets (so that we can add retry logic later on to
make sure that our tests won't fail as easy during
network issues)
