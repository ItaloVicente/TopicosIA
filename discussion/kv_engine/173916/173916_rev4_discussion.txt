DESCRIPTION:

MB-51805: Pass persistedPrepareSeqno(maxPrepareSeqno) to CkptMgr

We will set the value of the first Checkpoint to this value in a
future change to ensure that the on disk HPS is correctly updated
if we partially persist a snapshot, restart, and find on streaming
the rest of the snapshot that it does not contain any prepares.
