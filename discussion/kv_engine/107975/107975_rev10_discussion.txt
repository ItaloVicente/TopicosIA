DESCRIPTION:

MB-33805: Create 1 shard per core in topkeys

There is a lot of cache contention in topkeys. Perf data from when
I originally tested this change is below.

Triton 2 node 80/20 R/W test:
No change - ~3,200,000 ops/s
Topkeys disabled - 3,868,560 ops/s
Topkeys shared per core - 3,731,861 ops/s

What's the memory impact for this change (more shards and more keys per shard?)

Btw. this is also most likely going away due to collections...

Will look into memory footprint, I had some data but made the change a couple months ago and just recently rebased.
We still want to keep topkeys for mad-hatter at least as collections won't be GA until cheshire cat

iirc the agreement with PM was to deprecate top-keys in cheshire cat, and remove in the release after that, so still some time before it can be removed

Line:325, daemon/topkeys.cc -> I believe this comment is inaccurate after this patch...

Line:342, daemon/topkeys.cc -> Magic number - why 80?

Line:391, daemon/topkeys.cc -> Much of this is the same as doStats. Can you generalise the common parts?

Line:397, daemon/topkeys.cc -> Style: Prefer `auto*` here, making it explicit to the reader the item being iterated on is a pointer.
