DESCRIPTION:

MB-54516: Update collection history configuration

Primary change is that all history enablement is only via the
collection entry, removing any bucket/scope entry overrides.

Also changed in this commit is the disablement of history on the
default collection. Required to avoid having to support modify
collection with getAllVBSeqnos and a legacy DCP client.
