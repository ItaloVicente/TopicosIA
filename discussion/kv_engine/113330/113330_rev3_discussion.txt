DESCRIPTION:

MB-35281: default username to bucket name in cbvbucketctl

Follow the precedent of cbstats and set the default username to the
given bucket for cbvbucketctl. If authentication is not provided on the
command line, cbvbucketctl will now still try to auth. This will lead
to a more useful auth error, rather than "remote died".
