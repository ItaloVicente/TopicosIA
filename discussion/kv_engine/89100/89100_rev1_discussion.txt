Line:204, logger/spdlogger.cc -> should we do something similar here? (What did the old logger do with stderr - was it buffered?)

Line:204, logger/spdlogger.cc -> I believe that the "problem" here is that the buffering happens in the "logger" and not in the sink.. 

This is sent to the babysitter "in production", and I don't think it is a big problem that it is buffered (as we flush it timebased anyway). The problem with the unit tests is that we had something printing directly to the standard error and something going through the buffer so that they didn't appear in sequence...

Line:204, logger/spdlogger.cc -> So the only concern I have is in the past we've had crashes where the last few (important) messages have only appeared in the babysitter log file; as due to buffering we didn't flush memcached.log before crashing. This was possible because the console output (stderr) was unbuffered.

I think it is important to keep this behaviour in the new logger.

Line:204, logger/spdlogger.cc -> If we want to do that we can't use the dist sink as the buffering happens on the layer above that one... we could probably modify our macros to make sure we always explicitly flush the logs for every critical / fatal messages?

Line:204, logger/spdlogger.cc -> I don't really mind exactly how we implement it - although the downside of the macro suggestion is that the places where we /do/ use the logger object directly we'd have to manually remember to call flush().

Given spdlog lets you setup a hierarchy, would it be possible to rearrange things so we don't buffer on the stderr side; but only on the file side?

Line:204, logger/spdlogger.cc -> I need to read up a bit more on spdlogger internals to figure out that ;-)

We can probably solve that as a separate patch?

Line:204, logger/spdlogger.cc -> Sure - although could you open an MB so we can track it - I think we should try to get this fixed for Vulcan.
