DESCRIPTION:

MB-29676: Remove memcached bucket flush audit event

ns_server generate an audit event for a bucket flush.  However memcached
generates a similar event for when a memcached binary protocoal command
FLUSH or FLUSHQ is used.

The issue is that for couchbase (and ephemeral) buckets ns_server
performs a bucket flush without using the FLUSH or FLUSHQ commands.
Therefore when the ns_server performs a bucket flush its audit event
appears in the audit log, but the memcached one does not.

For memcached buckets where ns_server performance a bucket flush using
the FLUSH command both the ns_server and memcached bucket flush audit
events appear in the log.

This is confusing for the user and therefore we are removing the
memcached bucket flush audit event, and instead will rely on ns_server
for auditing when buckets are flushed.

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

I gave this some more thoughts last night and I'm tempted to keep the entry in there, but change the code in flush_command_context to look like:

    if (!connection.isInternal()) {
        audit_bucket_flush(....)
    }

That'll make sure that there _is_ an audit event if someone have the correct privilege to execute the flush command, but isn't going through ns_server...

Hey Trond, Sorry for the delayed reply.
I'm happy to make the change - but we still want to modify the UI, because I don't think we want it it to be visible. You agree?
