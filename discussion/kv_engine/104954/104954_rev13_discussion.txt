DESCRIPTION:

MB-33077 [SR]: Pending SyncWrites are never ejected

This patch addresses two different issues.

1) When a document has a Pending SyncWrite in flight, then subsequent
   writes (both durable and not-durable) are must be rejected.
   Checking for an in-flight Pending in Value Ejection mode is pretty
   simple: the CommittedState (Pending/Committed) is part of the
   StoredValue's Metadata, so always available in memory.
   But, in Full Ejection mode a Pending would be completely ejected, so
   the CommittedState would be lost.
   A way to address this issue is to never eject Key and Metadata for
   Pendings (i.e., always apply a Value Ejection policy, even when the
   Bucket is in Full Ejection mode).

2) We need the Value for committing a Pending. So, we need a BGFetch at
   Commit if the value has been ejected.
   But, while handling value-ejected Pendings via BGFetch is perfectly
   fine, a Pending is expected to be converted into Committed quickly
   (hopefully). Which means, the ejected value will be fetched from disk
   just after being ejected.

For all the above, we just skip Pendings at ejection, so a Pending is
always resident by logic (Key, Metadata and Value always in-memory).

Note that it comes with some side effects:

a) A burst of SyncWrites could fill up the Bucket Quota. That is handled
   in the same way as we currently do at Value Ejection when Key +
   Metadata fill up the memory quota (ENOMEM).

b) At Warmup, we may have a set of Pendings that doesn't fit entirely
   into the given Bucket Quota. While handling a) would prevent this
   case in most scenarios, it is still possible that a new Bucket Quota
   is set at node-restart.
   The idea (not yet implemented) is that we handle that in a Phase-1
   Warmup where we process all the Pendings, before switching to the
   usual Warmup execution.

Also, note that Value/Full Ejection were not supported at all before
this patch. So, this change implicitly covers both.
