DESCRIPTION:

MB-55656 Compute data size from internal fragmentation

Magma stores user docs in last level of seqIndex tree. The deletes are
gathered on levels above. The unfragmented data size is taken as
difference between size of last level - 2nd last level.

The sizes used to estimate data have to be the size before block
compression. We cannot use block compressed sizes as only after a
compaction can we know which unfragmented docs get together to form a
data block and what its compression ratio will be.

Magma recently fixed this by using size before block compression. To
tune the couch_docs_fragmentation accordingly, so that it is inline with
Magma's internal ratio, we now estimate the db_data_size from the
internal ratio and db_file_size.
