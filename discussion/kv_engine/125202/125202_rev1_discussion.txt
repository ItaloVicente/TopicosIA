DESCRIPTION:

MB-38656: Remove support from upgrading MetaData V0

In 3.0.0 we extended the metadata stored in the DocInfo to
include more information (datatype etc), and as part of
compaction we would inspect each document and replace
the content with a new DocInfo containing the new metadata
section.

Given that the only way to get into this situation would be
if someone took a CouchStore file written by a Couchbase
server < 3.0.0 (and never run compaction on the file) I think
it is safe to say that it is safe to kill the (complex) code.
(the callback for each document cause memory allocation and
copy for _every_ document in order to build the MetaData
object, and this happens _every_ time compaction runs).

If we ever end up in the situation where we want to reintroduce
the logic to rewrite the DocInfo structure we should keep
the status in a local document so we only try to inspect and
upgrade all documents one time (and not every time compaction
runs).

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think it’s worth mentioning that the 6.5 offline upgrade forces a compaction as part of upgrading to support collections and hence we are guaranteed to have compacted in a pre-6.5 -> 6.5 offline upgrade.

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> I can add that, but according to our "poorly documented" upgrade paths a person could try to do an offline upgrade from pre-6.5 directly to this version so that compaction would happen as part of _this_ installation)
