DESCRIPTION:

MB-43622: Fix race between DCP Open and scheduleDcpStep

Previously there was a possibility of a race for DCP
connections by the fact that DCP Open would create the handler
but it wouldn't set the state for the connection to DCP until
the method returned. In the mean time the cookie was available
for DCP to try to schedule a step.

This change sets the connection up as a DCP connection as part
of creating the the ConnHandler object.

Patch Set 4: Code-Review+1

Encoding the failure seen in the MB in a test would be quite complex, but we could just add a very simple unit-test that checks that we set the DcpConnHandler in the ctor of ConnHandler.
A simple DcpConnMap test that executed newProducer/newConsumer should be enough
