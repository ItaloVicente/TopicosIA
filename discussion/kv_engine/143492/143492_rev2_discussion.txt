DESCRIPTION:

MB-43622: Disable checks in scheduleDcpStep

Disable the "sanity checks" in DCP due to the possible race
scenario where the cookie is scheduled _before_ the completion
of DCP Open.

The code opens for a race due to the fact that it first creates
the DCP producer which is dispatched over to another thread before
it later on set the DCP state for the connection. If the other
thread decides to notify the cookie _before_ the thread executing
DCP Open manage to set the state to DCP the checks will fail.

This patch disable the extra checks while working on a permanent
fix which ensure this won't happen.
