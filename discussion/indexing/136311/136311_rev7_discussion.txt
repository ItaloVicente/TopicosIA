DESCRIPTION:

MB-41410 Flush feed's backch before processing reqch messages

When there are back-to-back MTR's and delBuckets requests from indexer,
backCh can easily get filled up and lead to a deadlock. By flushing
the backCh before processing a request, we make sure that backch has
enough space to process messages from new requests. This should not
have any functional impact as this flush can be considered as a
special case where feed always selects the backCh over reqCh
