DESCRIPTION:

MB-43967 Part 1: getIndexStatus cache fixes and ETag infrastructure

Part 1 includes some ETag infrastructure that as yet has no effect. Most
of the changes are fixes / rewrites of getIndexStatus caching code in
in manager/request_handler.go to address the following problems:

1. New data went to disk cache first but not memory cache, leading to
   inefficiencies and possible time travel (serving older data after
   having previously served newer data).

2. Disk cache cleanup deleted entries from memory cache based on older
   information about what indexer nodes are reachable, which could
   incorrectly purge memory cache entries that are newer than the staged
   data the disk persistor is working on.

3. It failed to locally cache latest known status of an unresponsive node
   that was retrieved from another node's cache, so if the other node
   also went down, status would be served from even older cache entries.

4. It cached results of the latest getIndexStatus even if they were only
   partial results due to caller filters and/or caller lacking permissions,
   thus purging prior full results from the cache, as only one entry is
   kept locally for each indexer node. The fix is to skip caching any
   partial result for a node. ns_server calls getIndexStatus for full
   results every 5 sec on every indexer node, and this is what we must
   cache, else ETags won't work. Performance would suffer and available
   info of unresponsive nodes would also be degraded if the last thing
   cached for a now-unresponsive node was only a partial result set.
