DESCRIPTION:

MB-46320 Make closing streams/recovery asyncronous in bootstrap1

When there are large number of indexes on a node, recovering
indexInstMap from metadata can take long time and this can
exceed 60 sec in some cases. This can lead to rebalance failure
for a node that is just added to the cluster.

Similarly, when there are large number of KV nodes in the cluster,
shutting down streams across all KV nodes can take more than 60
sec leading to a rebalance failure.

The rebalabce failure is because - indexer registers it-self as
a topology aware service only after bootstrap1 is successfully
completed. If bootstrap1 does not complete in 60 seconds, then
rebalance would fail - although subsequent rebalances should work

This patch makes the shutdown streams/recovering index inst map
code path asyncronous to main loop. Now, indexer can register
itself as a topology aware service even before recovery completes.
This change seems safe because of the following reasons:

a. Create and Build index DDL's would be blocked until indexer
moves to active state which happens only after storage warm-up
is done. Therefore, making the recovery code path asyncronous
should not impact DDL's. Same reasoning applies for scans as well.

b. Rebalance service manger takes any action (Like clean-up of
pending tokens from previous rebalance) or initiating planner on
rebalance only after indexer moves to active state.

With this patch, indexer main loop would start before index inst
map is ready but as most actions are taken only after indexer
is in ACTIVE state. Hence, this should not be a problem

In general, if we have experienced delay due to closing streams, we should try to do that asynchronously. Not sure making everything is completely race free.
Line:6564, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Q: How much is the expected time required for recoverIndexInstMap?

Line:6574, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Q: Is there a theoretical possibility to have a race between cleanupOrphanIndexes and any other metadata operation ?

In the past, we have avoided making unnecessary changes to bootstrap path as it is known to be sensitive.

The issue is that there are multiple components that can take time and there is a sequential dependency on each other. E.g., validateIndexInstMap can only happen after recoverIndexInstMap.
Line:6564, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Hi Amit, From the 10k index tests, it can take upto 30 seconds. That said, the issue is not just with recoverIndexInstMap. It can also happen due to closeAllStreams() - In this case closeAllStreams was the issue.

Line:6574, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> yes. It is possible as we process some opcodes like OPCODE_CLEANUP_INDEX in bootstrap code path. But I do not see how they can influence each other. cleanupOrpahIndexes cleans the disk files and do not touch the metadata. Am I missing anything?

Line:6574, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Agree. It should not matter. I thought it was looking at meta repo, but it is not.
