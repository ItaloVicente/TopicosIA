DESCRIPTION:

MB-46320 Make closing streams/recovery asyncronous in bootstrap1

When there are large number of indexes on a node, recovering
indexInstMap from metadata can take long time and this can
exceed 60 sec in some cases. This can lead to rebalance failure
for a node that is just added to the cluster.

Similarly, when there are large number of KV nodes in the cluster,
shutting down streams across all KV nodes can take more than 60
sec leading to a rebalance failure.

The rebalabce failure is because - indexer registers it-self as
a topology aware service only after bootstrap1 is successfully
completed. If bootstrap1 does not complete in 60 seconds, then
rebalance would fail - although subsequent rebalances should work

This patch makes the shutdown streams/recovering index inst map
code path asyncronous to main loop. Now, indexer can register
itself as a topology aware service even before recovery completes.
This change seems safe because of the following reasons:

a. Create and Build index DDL's would be blocked until indexer
moves to active state which happens only after storage warm-up
is done. Therefore, making the recovery code path asyncronous
should not impact DDL's. Same reasoning applies for scans as well.

b. Rebalance service manger takes any action (Like clean-up of
pending tokens from previous rebalance) or initiating planner on
rebalance only after indexer moves to active state.

With this patch, indexer main loop would start before index inst
map is ready but as most actions are taken only after indexer
is in ACTIVE state. Hence, this should not be a problem
