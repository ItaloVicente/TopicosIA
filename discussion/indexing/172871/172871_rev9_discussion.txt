DESCRIPTION:

MB-51425 Keep minNumShard consistent with max_cpu_percent unless changed explicitly

The config "plasma.minNumShard" is both a primary config and derived
config. Primary means that user can change it directly through
indexer settings endpoint. However, this stat also gets changed if
max_cpu_percent changes making it a derived config. However, the change
due to max_cpu_percent is not persisted in metakv.

So, if max_cpu_percent changes and some other setting change happens,
indexer will have the last persisted config.

E.g., on a 80 core box, default value of minNumShard will be 20. This
value will be persisted in metakv. If the max_cpu_percent changes to
2000, then minNumShard value will be changed to 5. However, if any other
setting change happens, then settings manager will construct the
minNumShard value from metakv and sends its value as 20. As there is no
change in max_cpu_percent indexer will continue to use 20. This results
in minNumShard value deviating from
math.Max(2, (max_cpu_percent/100) * 0.25).

This can lead to more shards than expected and therefore take performance
hit.

This patch fixes the issue by keeping minNumShard value in sync with
max_cpu_percent unless user changes explicitly.
