DESCRIPTION:

MB-42743 Implement latency histograms

The latency histograms are implemented to track:

a. Scan request init latency
b. Scan request wait latency
c. Scan request latency
d. Snapshot latency
e. Flush latency

Also, the avg_scan_request_init_latency and getseqnos timing
stats per index are being logged everytime as they help identify
scan latency issues

Line:52, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> Should we have more granular distribution for latencies greater than 100 ms ? 

With DGM or more number of rows being returned, we will need more granular info from the histogram.

We can have different latency distributions for different latencies (only of needed.). That way, we can change one without changing the other.

Line:84, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> Minor: dividing nanoseconds by milliseconds is not humanise (logically speaking.) We can divide while doing Add. That will be more readable.

Line:52, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> Hey Amit, Sure. So, of all the stats I added, only scan_latency_dist stat might require more granularity as it is end-to-end scan latency. Rest of the stats are expected to happen around the snapshotting interval.

For scan_latency_distribution stats, I have expanded the histogram range.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:84, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> I did think about this. But Add() is more frequent than GetValue() and division is not a cheap operation. Hence, used this logic
