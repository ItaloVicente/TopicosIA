DESCRIPTION:

MB-52382 (7.2.0 1543) Fix topology change orphaned token clean-up

Fix rebalance_service_manager.go getTransferTokenOwner()
to return the correct owner for TransferTokenAccepted and
TransferTokenRefused, which is Master. Previously this was
incorrectly returning Dest, which meant orphaned TTAccepted
TTs might not get cleaned up, causing the next rebalance to
immediately begin processing them. This could then further
cause a collision between those rogue TT builds and newly
published TTs for the same keyspace, triggering Rebalance
failure with "Build Already In Progress" for that keyspace.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Dest is the correct owner for TransferTokenAccepted for cleanup as the index metadata has already been created and needs to be cleaned up at the destination.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> If that is the case, doesn't it lead to the same problem I pointed out in the bug anyway -- the TT itself will not be deleted? (I do not understand why the cleanup does not delete ALL TTs but instead tries to keep some alive.)
