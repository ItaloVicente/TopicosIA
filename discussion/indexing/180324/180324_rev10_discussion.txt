DESCRIPTION:

MB-52928 Persist ShardIds in local meta

ShardIds (only for plasma storage) are persisted in local
meta during index creation. Tenant aware planner uses this
information to group index instances per shard and decide
on rebalance movements.

During rebalance, shardIds are persisted after index is
recovered into slice. Durin restart, if indexer sees any
difference between persisted shardIds and the current
shardIds, it is violation of an invariant. Indexer would
log that change and updates meta with new shardIds
