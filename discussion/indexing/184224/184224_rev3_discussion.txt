DESCRIPTION:

MB-52931 Drop indexes with delete tokens at the end of recovery

When an index is dropped, GSI client will send the drop
request to only REBAL_ACTIVE instances. If user issues a
drop index statement when indexes are in movement, then
the destination nodes will not be able to process the drop
request (as instances will be in REBAL_PENDING state). Since
a delete command token will be posted, lifecycleMgr::janitor
will cleanup such indexes. Janitor runs periodically
to identify such indexes and delete them

However, if rebalance finishes before janitor gets a chance
to cleanup the indexes, then the indexes will not be dropped
on destination even after rebalance is finished (the indexes
will be dropped on source though) - this can create some
confusion to users. To avoid such cases, shard rebalancer
makes a best effort call to try drop all the indexes in
transfer token for which DeleteCommandTokenExists in metaKV.

This is a best effort call made by rebalancer. Hence, all
errors are ignored
