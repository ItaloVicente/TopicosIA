DESCRIPTION:

MB-49356 Part 2 (7.1.0 1745): Boot: don't overwrite newer cache entries

requestHandlerCache populating the memory cache from disk cache at boot
could overwrite newer entries that might be present if a getIndexStatus
call had completed before the disk cache finished being read. ns_server
calls getIndexStatus every 5 seconds, and reading the disk cache into
the mem cache is done asynchronously, so this could occur.

The fix is to not memory cache things read from disk if there is a newer
entry already in the memory cache.

There was also an unintended rewrite of the info from disk back to disk,
which could overwrite newer disk entries from getIndexStatus. The fix
is to avoid write through to disk when populating the memory cache
during boot processing.
