Line:195, secondary/dataport/endpoint.go -> Q: This doesn't get logged here anymore? May be somewhere else?

Line:994, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Q: We don't want to log IncomingMut here?

Line:67, secondary/projector/kvdata.go -> Q: How would this behave with Collections?

Line:195, secondary/dataport/endpoint.go -> These stats get logged at lines 229-231 in new code

Line:994, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Done

Line:67, secondary/projector/kvdata.go -> Collections may have different feeds for the same bucket. This means we may have a kvdata component per collection. However, as collections do not own vbuckets, each kvdata component can still have an array of sequence number's it is processing. Therefore, the behaviour w.r.t. storing vbseqnos should not change
