DESCRIPTION:

MB-49356 Part 1 (7.1.0 1695): Autofailover: IsSafe() more logging

Autofailover IsSafe(): Log both the cached and current set of index
statuses as JSON. This is done in a goroutine as it must do scatter-
gather to get the current index statuses, which can take a long time.
Also, only log this if it has been at least 5 minutes since the prior
logging as the index status JSON can be huge.
