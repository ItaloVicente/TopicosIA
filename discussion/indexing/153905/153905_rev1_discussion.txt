DESCRIPTION:

MB-45964: Negative values for stat raw_data_size, key_size_distribution, backstore_raw_data_size

Negative stats are because the stats persisted with a snapshot are not the stats of that snapshot
– they are just the most recent stats available, so the stats don't match the snapshot and thus can go negative.
This happens as doPersist call is done as async call.
Fix is to collect stas at time of snapshot and pass it to doPersist.

Line:954, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> I think it would be good to keep this code after line 984 i.e. if CAS on isPersistorActive succeeds. Otherwise, every in-memory snapshot would carry this stats and can have some impact on memory (although little).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:954, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> The original code change looks fine to me as this code block gets executed if s.committed is true (i.e. for disk persisted snapshots only). It shouldn't impact in-memory snapshots.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:954, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> I am worried that the patchset 2 change responding to Varun's comment, that moved the stats back to its original location and removed "go" routine from "go mdb.doPersistSnapshot(s)", will have a performance impact, especially with my fix for MB-45743 which makes it wait for the disk to finish persisting stats before returning. If current routine is in a caller loop that persists snapshots for all indexes (thought I found this before, tho not finding it right now), then this would change it from a parallel operation to a sequential one, with potentially huge performance impact.

Better is to keep the stats collection here but do not do the line
    s.info.IndexStats = snapshotStats
Keep the call to doPersistSnapshot() as a go routine and pass it snapshotStats as a 2nd arg:
    go mdb.doPersistSnapshot(s, snapshotStats)
so it does not have to be added to s.info.IndexStats of the in-memory snapshots.

Line:954, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Good catch, addressed for both moi as well as plasma.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:954, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Agree with Deep - this code block is only for snapshots being persisted, so I think patchset 1 was good and patchsets 2-3 are not needed and would introduce a lot of unnecessary churn late in the release cycle. I had not noticed the pushdown of "go" into doPersistSnapshot() before, so the problem I was worried about does not exist but would prefer the lower-churn change of pathset 1.
