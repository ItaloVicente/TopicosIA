DESCRIPTION:

MB-35328 Handle KV failover from indexer

When a node is failed over, it can take arbitrarily long time for
ns_server on the failed over node to realise the failover and act
on it. When it is a KV node that is failed over, in some cases
(E.g. indexer is ahead of replica and ns_server takes more than
20 minutes to realise the failover), this can lead to a rollback to
"0" for indexer

The rollback situation can be avoided to some extent by making indexer
to act pro-actively on KV node failover rather than waiting for ns_server
of the failed over node to terminate the projector process/ intimate
memcached about failover

In this fix, indexer process monitors the clusterInfoCache periodically
(every 5 sec) and keeps a track of hostnames of the KV failed over
nodes. When indexer observes any failed over nodes, it sends a message
to dataport server (via mutation manager, stream reader) to close the
connection belonging to the failed over node

The mapping between a KV node hostname and remote address of the
connection is maintained in dataport server (Projector sends the
hostname of the KV node along with a stream-begin message. See
http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/110765/. The mapping between hostname
and connection address is made during this time).

The connection closure happens in the following cases:

a. When indexer receives a StreamBegin message from a connection that
is different from the connection dataport server has in its book-keeping
for the host in StreamBegin messages - In this case, the connection in
dataport server book-keeping will be closed and book-keeping will
be updated to contain a new connection

b. When indexer sends a CLOSE_SERVER_CONNS message - Indexer sends a
CLOSE_SERVER_CONNS message when indexer sees KV nodes in state
inactiveFailed (or) some KV nodes have moved out of cluster since the
last time indexer has updated it's cluster info cache. In this case,
indexer sends a message to dataport server containing the hostnames
of failed-over/rebalanced-out KV nodes along with the timestamp of
when cluster info cache is updated on indexer side.

The dataport server on receiving this message compares the time when a
connection is updated in it's book-keeping to the time when the cluster
info cache is updated on indexer side. An attempt to close the connection
happens only when the book-keeping time for the connection is less than
cluster info fetch time. This check is to ensure that indexer does to close
any connections that have been established as a part of restart attempt from
indexer

Line:156, secondary/dataport/server.go -> Hi Jeelan, This map is updated only inside the genServer routine. Hence, it need not be protected

Line:296, secondary/dataport/server.go -> Yes. I tested this on a 2-6.0.2 KV and 1-6.5.0 indexer. I did not see any issues
