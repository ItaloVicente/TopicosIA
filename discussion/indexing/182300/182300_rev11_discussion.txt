DESCRIPTION:

MB-52517: Disallow Alter Index and Create Index With Clause for Indexes

Implemented CreatePrimaryIndex5 and CreateIndex5 functions.
New interface Indexer5 was implemented which passes user credentials(IndexConnection) as parameters.
These credentials are used to perform a RBAC check to see if the user has permission to create the index with certain parameters in serverless mode.

1. IsOperationAllowed() returns false if the user is trying to Create Index with parameters that are disallowed in serverless.
2. IsParameterAllowed() returns true  if the only parameters present in with clause are "defer_build" or "retain_deleted_xattr" or both.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> There are multiple places where we are returning errors, but not logging any info. Do we need to log any info, so that debugging will be easy?
