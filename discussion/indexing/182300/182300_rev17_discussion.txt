DESCRIPTION:

MB-52517: Disallow Alter Index and Create Index With parameters in Serverless.

Implemented CreatePrimaryIndex5 and CreateIndex5 functions as a part of Indexer5{} interface. This interface passes the user crdentials as IndexConnection which can be used to perform a RBAC check.

1. IsOperationAllowed() returns fasle only if the user does not have permission to use certain paarmeters in WITH Clause in serverless mode.
2. IsParameterAllowed() returns true only if the WITH clause has either "defer_build" or "retain_deleted_xattr" or both.
