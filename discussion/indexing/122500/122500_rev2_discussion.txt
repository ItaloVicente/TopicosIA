DESCRIPTION:

MB-31109: Make indexer HTTP server listen on optional tcp protocol stack

If the cluster is configured for ipv4, indexer HTTP server
has to listen on ipv4:port. But optionally, it will try to
listen on ipv6:port as well.

Similarly, if cluster ios configured for ipv6, indexer HTTP server
has to listen on opv6:port. But optionally it will try to listen
on ipv4:port as well.

This is done only for HTTP server as this server can be accessed
by the external clients.

Error in listening on optional ip:port does not lead to process
exit.
