DESCRIPTION:

MB-39823 force strict consistency if bucket has no items

this provides better user experience after bucket flush, by making
consistent scans work as expected. There is a delay of 5 seconds between
bucket flush and its processing within indexer. During this duration,
consistent scans return results from old snapshot, which is both
confusing and incorrect.
