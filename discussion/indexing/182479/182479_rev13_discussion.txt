Line:380, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> Is this code required only for serverless model or it should be good for on-prem as well?

Line:4330, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> There can be n throttling events since lastStatsTime. streamKeyspaceIdThrottleDuration will capture the last one, in case that makes a difference.

Line:380, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> It can be for both serverless and on-prem.   When mutations are queued up, it means resource contention, OS error (out of disk space), or bug.  

For resource contention, it is better to slow down emittance of query in order to keep index up-to-date for both stale=ok and stale=false query.   

In case of OS error, stale=false query will time out regardless.  For stale=ok query, it can slow down but the queries will be emitted since they are not fully blocked.  But those queries will have no choice but returning stale data.

Having said that, since we have not tested in on-prem, I will enable this only for severless mode, but I think it will be useful in on-prem after we have tested it.
