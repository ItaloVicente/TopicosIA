DESCRIPTION:

MB-49381 support for sigar cgroup in projector process

With this change, the total memory and current memory used by
the container are reported from container's cgroup info rather
than reading system limits. Similarly, projector's maxCpuPercent
is adjusted based on the available cores to the container rather
than the available cores in the system.
