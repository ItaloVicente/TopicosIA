DESCRIPTION:

MB-49356 Part 5 (7.1.0 2037) Planner constraint violation checks

(NOTE Part 4 was mislabled "Part 1" when delivered. It was the first fix
to Planner for this bug but there were 3 prior fixes to getIndexStatus's
cache.)

1. Code simplification: Eliminate needless checkConstraint arguments
   that are always true. Makes it easier to understand where constraint
   checks might actually be skipped in the code.

2. Possible fix: In adjustInitialSolutionIfNecessary() move the call to
   cloned.evaluateNodes() to below all the adjustments made to the plan
   for replica repair. This call sets IndexerNode.meetConstraint for all
   the indexer nodes based on the contents of the initial plan. This was
   previously run before the adjustments so did not take account of any
   of these, and thus the initial meetConstraint flag settings could be
   incorrect if any of the adjustments changed the plan from valid to
   invalid. This might never be noticed later as the flag is often
   updated incrementally based on each plan change as it is made.
