DESCRIPTION:

MB-55062 Retry dropIndex if index is in async recovery

If index is in async recovery, dropIndex would fail with
"ErrIndexInAsyncRecovery". In such a case, sleep for 5 seconds
and retry drop index so that by the end of rebalance cleanup,
all indexes would be properly deleted.

Otherwise, if index is dropped during rebalance and /dropIndex fails
with ErrIndexInAsyncRecovery, then a new DDL with same name on same
keyspace will fail because of duplicate index name.

Also, after dropIndex, shards are destroyed. If index is in async
recovery and shards are destroyed, then plasma can panic due to
inconsistent state. To avoid these cases, /dropIndex is retried.

It is usually not expected to recover an index for more than
10 min. Hence, used 10min as the upper threshold for retries.
Shard destroy is skipped if dropIndex is not successful even
after 10 min.
