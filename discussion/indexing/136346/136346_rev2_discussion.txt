DESCRIPTION:

MB-41410 Process stream begins in a separate go-routine to avoid throttling data path

Processing stream begins in datapath for initializing projector latency
object is taking upto 20ms of time. For building indexes back-to-back
across multiple collections, this is causing significant delay overall.
By keeping this logic in go-routine, we can speed-up the datapath

Line:383, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> This has to be processed in handleWorkerMessage, isn't it ?

This change is ready for review.
Line:383, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> No. It is required idea to modify the projector latency map object in the same go-routine which updates it to avoid inconsistencies. Otherwise, two go-routines can set two different versions of projector latency map leading to inconsistency.

Previously, this was in handleWorkerMessage() as initLatencyObj() was happening there. As this is moved to processStreamBegins(), this is also being moved.

Line:383, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> Pardon my ignorance, but we will need to forward this type of message to m.streamBeginCh as well, Is it happening?
