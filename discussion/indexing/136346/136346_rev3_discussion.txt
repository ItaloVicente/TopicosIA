DESCRIPTION:

MB-41410 Process stream begins in a separate go-routine to avoid throttling data path

Processing stream begins in datapath for initializing projector latency
object is taking upto 20ms of time. For building indexes back-to-back
across multiple collections, this is causing significant delay overall.
By keeping this logic in go-routine, we can speed-up the datapath
