DESCRIPTION:

MB-45222: Delayed processing of deleteCommandTokens.

At many places in code there is assumption that if delete token is present in system then stop processing of ongoing create command token or index create/build processing. With drop token cleaner immediately deleting deleteCommandToken, there are corner cases which cause create toekn processing to go ahead and re-create a deleted index. By avoiding immediate cleanup of deleteToken we avoid these race cases.
