Line:2272, secondary/indexer/pause_service_manager.go -> Is it possible to reuse cluster info cache (m.genericMgr.cinfo)?

Line:2272, secondary/indexer/pause_service_manager.go -> we need the underlying client of cluster info cache as it has observers and callbacks for bucket updates. are you suggesting to create a wrapper over client.RunObserveCollectionManifestChanges inside cluster info cache?

Line:2272, secondary/indexer/pause_service_manager.go -> My few cents..

In cinfo lite we do reuse the payload data from the notification instead of calling the endpoint again. No extra call will be made to fetch bucket info. 

If we want to query the current HibernationState of a bucket in the cinfo lite (updated with notifications processed so far), we can add new APIs to bucketInfo and use them to fetch this new property of bucket (similar to other properties like NumVBuckets or Type etc..)

If we want do some action on every state transition and if we need to act on every state change, async processing of cinfo might not help. We can use Service Change Notifier for this and consume only the notifications that are needed.

If this goroutine is not a long running one, below approach of starting a new streaming connection and getting the notification to act on every state change can also be done.

Line:2272, secondary/indexer/pause_service_manager.go -> correct me if I'm wrong but cluster info cache does not listen on those changes isn't it? cluster info client is listening to collection manifest changes

and even in cluster info client, upon receiving bucket update notification, we fetch fresh info from bucket endpoint so that will again create overhead

Line:2272, secondary/indexer/pause_service_manager.go -> thanks Sai for this info. 
since this is not a long running function, let's use a new streaming connection

Line:2272, secondary/indexer/pause_service_manager.go -> Check with Sai on this. I think he made changes so that the notification payload is used to update the bookkeeping rather than fetching info again.

Line:2272, secondary/indexer/pause_service_manager.go -> As cluster info cache is already listening to the collection manifest changes, it can update the bucket hibernation state in the cache, which can be exposed via a function and used here.
