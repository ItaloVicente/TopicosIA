DESCRIPTION:

MB-55273 Avoid race between rebalance cleanup and dropOnSource token posting

Following race condition can exist in the shard rebalance algorithm:

a. Master node is about to post DropOnSourceToken or has just posted
   DropOnSourceToken
b. Due to eventual consistency of metaKV, the destination node
   has not yet synced the DropOnSourceToken
c. Rebalance has failed during this time and cleanup is invoked
d. When cleanup code reads the metaKV tokens, it will not find
   dropOnSource token - Therefore, it drops the index instances
   on destination node
e. However, when source node triggers cleanup, it will find
   dropOnSource token - as source node could have gotten the
   update from metaKV. Therefore, source node will drop index
   instances
f. This leads to cluster affinity violation - Source node deletes
   the index instances and destination node will also delete index
   instances

To avoid such a race condition, cleanup code path will fetch the
transfer tokens from metaKV again before deciding on whether to
drop indexes on source or destination node. This fetch is done
only once based on a configured timeout
