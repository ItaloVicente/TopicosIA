DESCRIPTION:

MB-40917: Introduce timeout in all indexing to memcached receive paths

BP of MB-30700 to alice

Timeout is added in only those code paths where projector/indexer is
actively waiting for response from memcached. The timeout is set before
making the request and the timeout is reset (i.e. no timeout) after the
response is received.
