Line:3694, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> for the default scope and collection, both INIT_STREAM and MAINT_STREAM use "bucket" name as keyspaceId for backward compatibility. That case needs to be handled here. In fact, the same problem already exists with keyspaceIdTsMap as well.

Line:3738, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> the duration of this lock can be reduced if the iteration is not done per index. The lock is required to protect the tk.ss.xx structs. As those structs are per streamId/keyspaceId, the counts don't need to be computed again for each index. We could compute the counts and store it per stream/keyspaceId(this will need lock). Then, the per index stats could be updated without the lock. You can do this change in another patch if that makes more sense.

Line:3738, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Yes. It definitely makes sense. Will address this in separate patch.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:3738, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Actually, doing that would directly contradict this patch as we need to hold a lock for iterating over tk.indexInstMap if we are not making a copy. 

But, making a copy would reduce the lock contention as we don't have to hold the lock for longer duration. Since timekeeper lock contention can impact in-memory snapshotting, I think it is better to reduce lock contention and go-head with copying the indexInstMap approach. Will do some tests with 1000's of indexes to benchmark the time taken to process while holding timekeeper lock in both cases. If there is a significant difference between the two, then we can go with the one with minimal latency
