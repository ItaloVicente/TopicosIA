DESCRIPTION:

MB-26307: moi - Throttle number of StoreToDisk by numCPU

When number of indexes > number of cores, the large number of
persistence go routines ends up causing CPU spikes which results in
increased query latency.
To solve this have a buffered channel = number of CPU cores and only
have as many persistence go routines as number of cores.
So the total number of go routines spawned = numCPU * concurrency

Line:730, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> By adding 1 to memdbPersistorCount in the if check, isn't it going to keep incrementing on every commit snapshot and get out of sync with the actual number of persistors?

Line:731, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> I think it would be better to limit number of persistors based on the setting "settings.moi.persistence_threads" so users can control the max cpu usage. For co-located setups, it would be good to have this ability.

Thanks Deep, I'll use the config setting like you suggest.
Line:730, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Yes I was trying to see if we can do this in a lock free manner.

Line:731, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Done
