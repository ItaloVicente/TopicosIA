DESCRIPTION:

MB-26307: moi - Throttle number of StoreToDisk by numCPU/4

When number of indexes > number of cores, the large number of
persistence go routines ends up causing CPU spikes which results in
increased query latency.
To solve this have a buffered channel = number of CPU cores and only
have as many persistence go routines as number of cores.
So the max number of go routines spawned = 4 * concurrency
Add ability to dynamically tune the number of persisters

Hi Sarath, the latest patch includes dynamic runtime tuning of the persister threads as you had suggested. Please let me know if this is what you had in mind. thanks

Line:253, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> You can check if cap(moiWriterSemaphoreCh) is >= moiWritersAllowed and reset moiWritersAllowed = cap incase somebody asked for higher persister count.

Line:300, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> We don't need to divide by 4 right ?
Already config sets the value.

Line:304, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Since we added updateMOIWriters in indexer config init path, do we need the updateMOIWriters here ?

Line:253, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Sounds good. Will do that. thanks

Line:300, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> divide by 4 is only because we are using the same config parameter which is initialized to 2*NumCPU(). Each persister also spawns upto 2*NumCPU() go routines, so I thought it might be good to restrict the number of persisters by 4?

Line:304, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> updateMOIWriters is only added in the handleConfigUpdate(). Is that invoked during indexer initialization? If so we can remove it, otherwise we still need this right?

Line:300, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Sure, will do that, also update the commit message. So by default the number of persisters will be limited to the number of cores & the max number of go routines spawned for persistence will be NumCPU()*2*NumCPU() by default.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:300, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> I think, it is better to reduce settings.moi.persistence_threads if we really want to reduce the concurrency limit rather an doing / 4 right ?
That way it is cleaner and easily understandable.
