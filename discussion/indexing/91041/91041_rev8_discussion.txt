DESCRIPTION:

MB-26307: moi - Throttle number of StoreToDisk by numCPU/4

When number of indexes > number of cores, the large number of
persistence go routines ends up causing CPU spikes which results in
increased query latency.
To solve this have a buffered channel = number of CPU cores and only
have as many persistence go routines as number of cores.
So the max number of go routines spawned = 4 * concurrency

1. I think it may be easier to work with a single setting. The number of bg persistors could be same as persistence_threads(probably we could change it to NumCPU). If num of indexes are less than num of cores, the indexes get more concurrency. Otherwise it gets capped. 

2. Another thing to consider would be make the persistors grow/shrink when the setting gets changed without restart of indexer.

Line:286, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> the path needs to be "moi.max_concurrent_persisters". settings need to be removed.(in case we decide to keep 2 settings)
