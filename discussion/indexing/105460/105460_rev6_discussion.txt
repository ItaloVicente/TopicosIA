Line:285, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> How about managing the stats inside tryRespondWithError()?  In this case, we can also take care of timeout for count request as well.
Also, are we not getting cancel error from requesting snapshot?  if so, it is a bug.

Line:432, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> what about timeout and cancel for count request?

Line:459, secondary/protobuf/projector/index.go -> How does these stats being printed to projector log or through rest API?

Line:285, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> We could do it as part of tryRespondWithError as well. I see that doing there will help handleCountRequest and handleMultiScanCountRequest requests as well. 

I will double check if we get timeout or client cancel in case of snapshot not being available within 2 mins. From what I know, it should be timeout, requested snapshot is not available.

Line:432, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> I will move stats updation to tryRespondWithError

Line:459, secondary/protobuf/projector/index.go -> This change will be integrated with Varun's stats manager and it will be printed periodically in projector log
