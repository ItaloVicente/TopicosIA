DESCRIPTION:

MB-31752 Log the response body and URI path when JSON un-marshalling of http response fails

When the response received from ns_server is not in expected format, un-marshalling
would fail

The stringified response is now dumped to the logs along with the query path
when the un-marshalling fails inorder to help identify the source of failure
