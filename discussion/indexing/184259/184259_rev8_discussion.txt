DESCRIPTION:

MB-52931 Notify lifecycle manager on async recovery done

If index is dropped during async recovery (either due to
scope/collection drop (or) user issued a drop), then
indexer should defer the index deletion until recovery
is done - as plasma expects indexer to serialize slice
recovery and slice destruction.

To achieve this, lifecycle manager will mark the index
instances that are in async recovery. If any of these
instance are dropped while recovery is in progress, then
they will be dropped after recovery is done. Indexer
will notify that async recovery is done for an instance
after recovery is complete.

Also, metadata updates to the index after recovery are
skipped if index is dropped during async recovery

Line:81, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> Since there will be DeleteCommandToken posted by client for this index, janitor will take care of deleting this instance on restart.

For the cases of scope/collection drop, manager will issue OPCODE_INVALID_COLLECTION and cleanup the instances after recovery.

In both cases, the index will be eventually deleted. 

Currently, if a drop is received for async recovery, we do not update the meta (We do that only after async recovery is done). We just update in-memory book-keeping and return. I am thinking to move this book-keeping update after updating the state as DELETED. I will address this in a separate patch.

Line:81, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> We can not currently update inst state to DELETED and then update the book-keeping (in droppedInstsInAsyncRecovery) because, rebalancer will consider indexes in DELETED state as done and can go-ahead and destroy the local shard data in case of failure scenarios. 

This can lead to unwanted race conditions with plasma - as recovery is in progress on one side and shard is destroyed on other side. To achieve this, we need to build the logic in indexer. I will try to address this in a separate patch

Line:81, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> Sounds good. The eventual cleanup should work fine.
