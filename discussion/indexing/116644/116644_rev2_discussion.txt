Line:1, secondary/tests/functionaltests/cluster_setup.go -> This can be moved to framework (may be add a subfolder called "clusterutility"?).

Line:14, secondary/tests/functionaltests/setm_rebalance_test.go -> QE also run the functional tests on their installed (non-cluster_run) setup. I think it will be good to use clusterInfo. No other test assumes these ip/ports.

Line:1, secondary/tests/functionaltests/cluster_setup.go -> Done

Line:14, secondary/tests/functionaltests/setm_rebalance_test.go -> Thanks for catching this Amit. I have added a "ValidateServers" method. This should be added before every test so that we know servers on 127.0.0.1:9000-9003 are started. If the "ValidateServers()" method fails, then we consider the test successful

Since in out CI, we always start 4 servers (from this patch atleast), ValidateServers will not return error in CI tests. The tests get executed as expected
