> If its not too difficult to have the server list in the config, that should be preferred. If its a lot of work, then we can go ahead with having hard code values.

It is not too difficult to move but we need to move both server list and their corresponding OTP values (because of the check at http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/116644/8/secondary/tests/framework/clusterutility/cluster_setup.go@208) as it is not easy to deduce OTP value for a newly added node.

If it is ok to move both server list and their OTP values, then we can move the nodes to config file. Any user changing the node list should change both the node list and corresponding OTP values
