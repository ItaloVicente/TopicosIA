If its not too difficult to have the server list in the config, that should be preferred. If its a lot of work, then we can go ahead with having hard code values.
Line:17, secondary/tests/framework/clusterutility/cluster_setup.go -> will this still work if the first node renames itself?

Line:26, secondary/tests/framework/clusterutility/cluster_setup.go -> will this still work if the first node renames itself?

Line:12, secondary/tests/functionaltests/setm_rebalance_test.go -> I think it would be cleaner to disable these tests based on config param.

| as it is not easy to deduce OTP value for a newly added node.

The testrunner framework also use rest api for rebalance I think. You can may want to check with some in QE how do they deduce the OTP value.
Line:12, secondary/tests/functionaltests/setm_rebalance_test.go -> I think a better option is to add this to the config file rather than a command line parameter. 

It should be fine to keep validateServers as well.

In the latest patch, I am checking if the response contains the string "otpNode". As per my understanding, the response can contain the "otpNode" string only on a successful addition of node
Line:12, secondary/tests/functionaltests/setm_rebalance_test.go -> Done

Line:17, secondary/tests/framework/clusterutility/cluster_setup.go -> Yes. This seems to work

Line:26, secondary/tests/framework/clusterutility/cluster_setup.go -> No. But, I am not using this anywhere in the code. The code is built on the assumption that node 127.0.0.1:9000 always remains in the cluster. Removed this line in latest patch

Line:12, secondary/tests/functionaltests/setm_rebalance_test.go -> Added a command line parameter: "enablemultipleindexertests". By default this is set to false. We need to explicitly add it to command line to enable the multiple indexer tests. Added this to command line in "dotest".

Even with this option, I think we should have validateServers() call to handle the scenario where we have less servers than required (E.g., if some one calls *cluster_run -n2* and enables rebalance tests, for those cases, it will log an error and return
