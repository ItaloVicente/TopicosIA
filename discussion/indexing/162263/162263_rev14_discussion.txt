Line:492, secondary/planner/executor.go -> Doubt: This looks like one ns_server call per scope. Can we reduce this to one call get all scope limits.

Line:574, secondary/planner/executor.go -> Very very minor: Somehow this function does not seem to fit in with clusterInfo philosophy. Its not updating the cache and does not use anything from cache. Looks like we remove the receiver cinfo object and make it stand alone function call.

Ignore if this is already thought about.

Line:492, secondary/planner/executor.go -> As this call is conditional (will be executed only in case of free tier), it is okay to incur this cost and avoid dependency on planner proxy as it does not require collection manifest - for any other reason.

Line:492, secondary/planner/executor.go -> Thanks Amit. 

I was thinking if we can have a function which does one rest call and gets scope to limit map once for all the scopes available we can reduce one rest call per scope to one rest call overall. Sorry if i am missing something very obvious here. I see no dependency on the planner proxy.

Line:492, secondary/planner/executor.go -> Got it. This is index creation code path. Only one index can be created at a time. The handling of multiple index specs is just to keep API compatibility. That won't happen.
