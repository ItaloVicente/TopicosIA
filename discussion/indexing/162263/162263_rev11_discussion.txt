Line:480, secondary/planner/executor.go -> This patch is not self sufficient in itself. The caller of ExecutePlan is not passing enforceLimits. It is happening in the next patch.

The idea of dividing work in multiple patches is to have self-sufficient milestones. With these patches, that doesn't happen. 

So, it would be ok if you merge these two patches in one, or let "enforceLimit" implementation happens in the third patch.

Line:498, secondary/planner/executor.go -> Please run gofmt.

Line:677, secondary/dcp/pools.go -> As commented by Varun on the previous patch, does this require a read lock ? Is it already implemented somewhere else in the code path ?
