(6 comments)
Line:679, secondary/dcp/pools.go -> Let' not have an infinite loop. Let's fail the request after 5 retries.

Line:487, secondary/planner/executor.go -> Code safety: please check if cinfoClient is nil.

Line:493, secondary/planner/executor.go -> Use some delimiter like ":" between bucket and scope names.

Line:502, secondary/planner/executor.go -> It is not necessary to iterate over all indexSpecs here if we are already iterating in line 492.

Line:505, secondary/planner/executor.go -> You can directly return common.ErrIndexScopeLimitReached. No need to do errors.New()

Line:572, secondary/planner/executor.go -> It is better to add name of the component in the user agent - it is better for debugging.

Line:679, secondary/dcp/pools.go -> Done

Line:487, secondary/planner/executor.go -> Done

Line:493, secondary/planner/executor.go -> Done

Line:502, secondary/planner/executor.go -> In line no. 492 : we iterate over indexSpecs and if the current "bucket:scope" combination has not been encountered earlier in the loop, we go for enforcing the limit.

We will find out the limit, if it is not nil proceed to enforce it. 

Now in order to enforce the limit, all new indexes to be created under that "bucket:scope" should be considered.
For example there are multiple requests(size of indexSpecs > 1) to create new indexes under the same scope and bucket, then I will iterate over indexSpecs and find total number of new indexes under the bucket and scope to be created and see if that number is within the scope limit. As this process will be same for all requests to create new indexes under the current "bucket:scope" combination, so this will happen only once whenever a new "bucket:scope" combination is encountered.

Line:505, secondary/planner/executor.go -> common.ErrIndexScopeLimitReached has "Limit for number of indexes that can be created per scope has been reached.", I add the value of the limit here and generate a new error. hence the current implementation.
