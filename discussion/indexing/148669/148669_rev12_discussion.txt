DESCRIPTION:

MB-32093 Slowdown ingestion from dcp_feed when projector is under memory pressure

When system is under memory pressure, DCP feed will sleep for
some time to slow down ingestion into KVData and workers. With
slow incoming rate, the memory consumed by projector should
come down and therefore reduce the memory pressure on system

The time for which dcp feeds sleep is determined by the RSS
of projector process

Line:1729, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> indexer sends collectionsAware true for MAINT_STREAM as well.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1729, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Thanks for catching this. Updated the code to differentiate maintStream based on collectionIds. This won't work for pre-7.0 nodes though. I will work on a separate patch - may be use feed's name to distinguish between INIT_STREAM and MAINT_STREAM
