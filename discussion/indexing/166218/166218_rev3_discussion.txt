DESCRIPTION:

MB-46068 Force disk snapshot with maintFlushTs during merge

In this patch, we force a disk snapshot with maint_stream flushTs
at the time of index merge. This will help to solve two problems:

a. Usage of bucket_seqnos for session consitent scans - Currently,
we can not use bucket seqnos to serve session consistent scans
(although snapshot get generated in MAINT_STREAM) because, if there
are no mutations after an index is built, then the last snapshot
would continue to contain collection seqnos. Any scan using bucket
seqnos would timeout if there are no further mutation on the bucket

b. During recovery/rollback, indexer may have to fallback by a large
difference in seqnos. if there are no mutations happening on a
collection (as index disk snapshot would contain collection seqnos.
which can be much behind bucket seqnos). This will lead maint_stream
to catch up a large number of mutations. Having maint_stream seqnos
in index disk snapshot will ensure that all indexes will have similar
range of seqnos. and recovery can be faster
