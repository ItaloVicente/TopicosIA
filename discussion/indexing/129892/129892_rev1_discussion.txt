DESCRIPTION:

MB-39148 Make the default size of sliceBufSize proportional to numWriters

Currently, the default size of sliceBufSize is set at 50000. This value is
shared across all writers in a slice. This can become a memory overhead
when there are large number of idle indexes.

Experimentally, noticed that the time spent in wait on cmdCh in slice
before and after reducing the sliceBufSize was around 5.8 sec (for 20M
mutations, MOI storage) and the index build time was not impacted.

Default numWriters are configured to runtime.GOMAXPROCS. So, the default
value of sliceBufSize is made proportional to runtime.GOMAXPROCS

Line:2009, secondary/common/config.go -> I think this is still a high number. Can you try with 200 per writer and see if there is any perf impact?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2009, secondary/common/config.go -> Ok. I haven't noticed any change in avg. index build times (across 5 samples) with cmdCh size 200. I have gone down till cmdCh size to 25 per slice but hardly noticed any difference. I will reduce this to 200
