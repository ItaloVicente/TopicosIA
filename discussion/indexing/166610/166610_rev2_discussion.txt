DESCRIPTION:

MB-48243 Cleanup erroneous MoveIndexToken in Janitor

Usually, erroneous MoveIndexTokens are cleaned-up from
metakv as soon as the error is updated. However, if the
token is recreated in metakv due to some race conditions,
other move operations might fail as we expect only one
move index token to exist in metakv. To address those
problems, rebalance janitor periodically cleans-up all
erroneous move index tokens
