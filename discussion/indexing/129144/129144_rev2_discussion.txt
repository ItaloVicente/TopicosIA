DESCRIPTION:

MB-39001: Handle scan requests when snapshot TS is ahead of request TS

BP of MB-32087

If scan has SessionConsistency option and scan coordinator's latest snapshot
is ahead of bucket KV TS, then switch to using the new SessionConsistencyStrict
which behaves similar to QueryConsistency i.e. compares both seqnos and
vbuuids of scan request with snapshot before serving the scans. This is
done so that scans after bucket rollback do no return incorrect results. With
this new consistency mode, the session consistent scans wait till a
snapshot is consistent with both KV seq nos and vbuuids is available.

Also, enable this new behavior with the config setting
indexer.enable_session_consistency_strict (default is true)

(cherry picked from commit 0879d5d4752ec0db521d17a0314712e69ec40a53)
