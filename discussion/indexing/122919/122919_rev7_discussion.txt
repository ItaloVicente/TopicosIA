DESCRIPTION:

MB-37737: Set immutable flag to false when index is partitioned and partial

Immutable flag is always set to true if an index is partitioned index. This
breaks upsertDeletes for an index that is partial and partitioned index. The
fix sets the immutable flag to true when the index is partial overriding
partitioned index.

The fix also changes flusher behavior to avoid un-necessary slice Deletes.
The new design is:
  UpsertDeletion - if partition key is available, delete from the partition
  the mutation belongs to.
  Delete mutation - Delete from all partitions as we will not have partition
  key in case of a delete mutation

The fix also includes a change in projector to always evaluate partition key
irrespective of whether WHERE evaluates to true or false.

Also, this patch does not attempt to fix metadata of an existing partitioned +
partial index, however sets the right Imuutable value in index definition in
mutation manager.

Line:408, secondary/indexer/flusher.go -> Not related to your patch: For processedUpserts,  Instead of slice, I think it is better to use a map so that look-up is faster (especially with collections)

Line:301, secondary/protobuf/projector/index.go -> Can this be moved above i.wherePredicate call ? Is there any advantage of doing that ?

Line:408, secondary/indexer/flusher.go -> Since this is not related to to the fix, we can look at it as a CC task

Line:301, secondary/protobuf/projector/index.go -> Will that make a difference?

Line:482, secondary/indexer/flusher.go -> as a future enhancement in processDelete, we could check if partn key is meta().id, then it can be optimized to delete from just one partition instead of all partitions. please file a ticket for this.

Line:495, secondary/indexer/flusher.go -> instead of iterating over the map, we can just get the partn from the map
