DESCRIPTION:

MB-36609: Fix replica repair in case of multiple server groups

Before starting the planner runs, replicaRepair mechanism
will identify lost replicas, and for each lost replica an indexer
node is chosen which will host the newly built replica. The choice
of indexer node takes into account the existing replica placement
but ignores the server groups.

The fix for this issue:
1. Enforces the server group constraints, along with replica
   constraints while choosing the target indexer node for placing
   the new replicas.
2. Update solution's replicaMap with the new replica before planner
   runs start.
