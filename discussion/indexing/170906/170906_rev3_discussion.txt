DESCRIPTION:

MB-49382 Part 3 (7.1.0 2284) Fix num_cpu_core indexer stat for cgroups

Per Part 2 of this fix, stats_manager.go global var num_cpu_core was
being initialized to runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0) under the belief that, since
Indexer creates the Settings Manager (NewSettingsManager()) before the
Indexer Stats (NewIndexerStats()), and the former updates GOMAXPROCS to
the desired value min(node, cgroup, "Indexer Threads"), then the stat
initialized from the num_cpu_core var would be correct.

However, num_cpu_core was initialized inside a Go native init() func,
which gets executed at package load time, not constructor call time.
Since both Settings Manager and Indexer Stats are in the indexer
package, the init was happening before any constructor code of either
Settings Manager or Indexer Stats ran, so it picked up the value before
Settings Manager had adjusted it.

The fix is to eliminate the global var num_cpu_core and call
runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0) directly when initializing the stat. The only
place the num_cpu_core global was read was to initialize that stat, so
it was superfluous.
