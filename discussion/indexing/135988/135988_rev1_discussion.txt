With concurrent index creation - two or more indexers can try creating indexes in parallel. With smaller timeout, and with large number of indexes, if planner takes more time than timeout, the two indexers can keep undoing work done by the other - by overwriting prepare lock in prepare phase - and by failing in commit phase.

This may end up exhausting retries in case of concurrent index creation. 

Longer the time-out, lesser the probability of such like of deadlock situation.

The original idea behind the timeout is query node failure. Assuming that it is a rare case, we can increase this timeout to even larger values like 30 mins.

One more question, what happens if user issues a create index and while planner is in progress, user cancels the create request. Will it cleanup the prepare or will it be left to eventually timeout?

There is no mechanism to send cancel event from query to indexing as of today. The create index request from query code is synchronous and atomic. For create index only response we can return is error. This is different that scan request where the sender can be closed if the user cancels the request.

To add more details, the prepare lock will be held until index is created OR prepare timeout happens. 

cancelPrepareIndexRequest here is not related to user cancelling the request. It is about releasing the prepare lock on indexers. This happens on error or on failing to get full quorum.

ok thanks. Let's see how long planner takes in experiments with 10k indexes and multiple nodes to arrive at a reasonable timeout.
