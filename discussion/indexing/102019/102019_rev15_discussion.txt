DESCRIPTION:

MB-31805 Show all indexes on UI

When one of the index nodes fail, the index information shown on the
UI is not accurate. Any new indexes created will not be shown on the
UI. This patch fixes that issue

Line:1532, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> Q: Will iteration work accurately if we modify allInsts while iterating over it simultaneously?

Line:73, secondary/manager/common/index_defns_metakv.go -> The 'bool' part does not seem to be used anywhere. Right? If yes, can we please return a list from this function?

Line:1532, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> Yes. As this is a Map interface, there is no need to do iterator invalidation.

Line:73, secondary/manager/common/index_defns_metakv.go -> Returning a list requires iterator invalidation. This logic is more complex. Hence a map interface is used even though we are not using the bool value. In this case, the bool value is just a place holder.

Line:5336, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> This is synchronous bootstrap code path. It may not be a good idea to init cluster info cache/call metakv here. It can cause rebalance in of a new node to timeout.

Line:5372, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Is this required? You have code in DeleteIndexInstance/DeleteIndex to cleanup metakv. cleanupIndexMetadata is internally going to call that.

Line:1522, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> This block of code should be moved to its own function and executed as part of onRebalanceDoneLOCKED. Also this code will get executed on each failover, do you want that to happen?

Line:1526, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> The response time for failover is expected to be very small. I am not sure we can afford to call metakv(at least synchronously). One option is to move this code block to DDLServiceMgr.

Line:368, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> It would be good to log the err.

Line:581, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> ns-server now publishes the nodeUUID of each node in /pools/default. You may want to add that to clusterInfoCache.

Line:5336, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Moved it to a background thread.

Line:5372, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Currently, I am persisting the index defn to MetaKV as soon as the index is added to topology. If the indexer node crashes after persisting to MetaKV and restarts, then the definitions of non-deferred indexes has to be cleared. 

This piece of code is required only to avoid inconsistency arising out of crash scenarios

Line:1522, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> Moved it to separate method in DDL service manager. The intention behind this code is to remove instances from Metakv for those nodes that have gone out of the cluster - to prevent metakv leak).

As per my understanding, this code gets executed at the end of rebalance. I am getting all the KeepNodes in the cluster and only removing those instances that belong to the nodes that are not a part of the cluster

Line:1526, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> Moved it to DDL service manager

Line:368, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> Done

Line:581, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> The nodeUUID was previously required to maintain a tight coupling between hostname and nodeUUID when returning the results back to getIndexStatus call

As per the info. from ns_server team, hostname is tightly coupled to nodeUUID. In a multi-node cluster, if it has to change, then the node has to be brought down and rebalanced back in with new hostname. In that case, nodeUUID also changes. Since ns_server maintain a tight coupling between nodeUUID and hostname, we do not need this change anymore

Line:1522, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> When the node comes back from failover, the instances are added back to metakv during bootstrap flow
