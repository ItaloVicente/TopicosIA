DESCRIPTION:

MB-50164: Analyze impact of in-memory compression on planner index movement

Enable the feature in-memory compression once the cluster is fully upgraded to 7.1.
This is done to avoid different versioned indexers treating memUsed stats in wrong way during upgrade period.
Wrong interpretation of memUsed stat could have caused planner to make suboptimal index placement in some cases during cluster upgrade.

Line:10329, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Any reason to fetch entire cluster info cache here ? Can we have indexer receiver to this function and use the cinfo lite ?

Line:1778, secondary/manager/common/token.go -> Just Curious: Why do we need another new path and token ? Settings update are anyways stored on metakv right ?

Line:10329, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Good suggestion, will use cinfolite.

Line:1778, secondary/manager/common/token.go -> We need to be able to differentiate between we changing the setting vs end user changing the setting. Because once we have enabled the setting and end user disabled it we dont want to enable it again on restart.  Which means we can not overwrite the original setting. Doing that using single setting value would have required some in memory state and logic to infer final setting from inmemory state and setting value combination. Adding this second variable to metakv solves that. This is internal variable and if this is set we have already done the job of enabling feature, if not we have not enabled it.
