DESCRIPTION:

MB-50164: Analyze impact of in-memory compression on planner index movement

Enable the feature plasma in-memory compression once the cluster is fully upgraded to 7.1.
This is done to avoid different versioned indexers treating memUsed stats in wrong way during upgrade period.
Wrong interpretation of memUsed stat could have caused planner to make suboptimal index placement in some cases during cluster upgrade.
