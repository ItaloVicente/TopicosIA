DESCRIPTION:

MB-50164: Analyze impact of in-memory compression on planner index movement

Enable the feature plasma in-memory compression once the cluster is fully upgraded to 7.1.
This is done to avoid different versioned indexers treating memUsed stats in wrong way during upgrade period.
Wrong interpretation of memUsed stat could have caused planner to make suboptimal index placement in some cases during cluster upgrade.

Line:10299, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> "marshelling" typo.

Line:10305, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Q: Will this override the "false" setting set by the user action ?

Line:175, secondary/manager/common/token.go -> Is it possible that two different nodes post two different values for a same key, at a same time ?

If that happens, I am worried if metakv handles the conflicts elegantly. 

If we can remove indexerId, all nodes will write same value, at the same time.

Line:10299, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Ack

Line:10305, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> If user enables the feature before upgrade to 7.1 is complete we will not override it. By default the feature is disabled.
Only if user disables the feature even before cluster is upgraded to 7.1 we will override it. But does it make sense to disable a feature which is already disabled?

Line:175, secondary/manager/common/token.go -> sure i will remove indexerId
