DESCRIPTION:

MB-51229: Fix concurrent idx.config (map) access

By design, "idx.config" map should be a read only object. Any config
changes should result in updation of values in a new config object.
And once updation is done, the reference to new object should be stored
in idx.config for further reading. The updates are not expected to
idx.config. Please note that idx.config can be read by multiple
threads concurrently, as per the design.

The problem:
Due to recent changes in indexer::handleConfigUpdate, the new object
reference was assigned to idx.config before all the updates happened.
So, while updates were still happening on new object, idx.config
got accessed - by another thread - for reading (which had the
reference of new object). This lead to concurrent read/write of the
map.

The solution:
As expected by design, assign new object reference to idx.config
only after all the updates to new object are done.
