Line:1349, secondary/indexer/shard_rebalancer.go -> I think here now if isMissingBSC is false, we should still call initiateLocalShardCleanup before returning from this function?

Line:1369, secondary/indexer/shard_rebalancer.go -> During cleanup after restart, we'll also have to consider the case that if drop index had succeeded before restart but local shard cleanup didn't get initiated or succeed, shard cleanup should be called again.

Line:1349, secondary/indexer/shard_rebalancer.go -> In this case, I think we should re-attempt the dropIndex as we can not trigger local shard cleanup without closing the slice. By setting an error here, I am relying on cleanup patch to take care of the cleanup. The patch: https://review.couchbase.org/c/indexing/+/180103 takes care of this scenario by initiating another dropIndex command.

During cleanup, we go-ahead and destroy the shard data irrespective of the status of "/dropIndex" command

Line:1369, secondary/indexer/shard_rebalancer.go -> I this case, I am assuming that there will be cleanup happening at 2 places:

a. Indexer during bootstrap will cleanup the left over data as orphan index files
b. Rebalance cleanup after restart will remove those files

The patch: https://review.couchbase.org/c/indexing/+/180103 will handle the cleanup
