DESCRIPTION:

MB-53870: Add Comment about map access for IndexerStats.Indexes

- It is read by handleMetricsHigh in stat_manager
- When setIndexStats will be called elsewhere, it can cause race with handleMetricsHigh

Patch Set 2:

(2 comments)
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Also, let's not commit anything against resolved MB.

For trivial code changes (like this) we can use MB-100.

Line:1068, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> I think the caller does not need to worry about race, isn't it? 

Also, can you please add the details about 
1. How indexer clones the stats object before distributing to the workers and 
2. How cloning of stats avoids concurrent map access ?
