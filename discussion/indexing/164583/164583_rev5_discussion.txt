DESCRIPTION:

MB-48981 Part 2 (7.1.0 1558) Smart Batching MOI performance regression

Fixing why Smart Batching Rebalance is slower than old Rebalance in the
MOI case.

Part 1 fixed long sleeps during Rebalance, in addition to adding useful
permanent performance and mutex instrumentation.

Part 2 fixes the following additional significant time-consuming areas:

1. GetIndexStatus() work moved from synchronous in the
   publishTransferTokenBatch() codepath to asynchronous in a goroutine,
   so the extremely long time it can take to refresh a ClusterInfoCache
   plus do scatter-gather REST calls are no longer in the codepath.

2. Rebalancer.getLocalStats() replaced with direct stats lookups. This
   eliminates all the work of reformatting and mapifying, marshaling,
   unmarshaling, and overhead of local REST call.

3. Plasma returns 0% instead of 100% avgResidentPercent if there are 0
   indexes, which caused empty nodes to be treated as highly loaded,
   thus triggering round-robin build assignment to them instead of
   maxing out their builds and getting better stream sharing. Now it
   gets the num_indexes indexer stat to check for this special case.
