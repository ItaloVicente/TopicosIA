DESCRIPTION:

MB-42743 Update waitPersist logic based on flushDone messages from flusher

The total slice writers in indexer equals num_indexes * num_cores. With
large number of indexes on high cores machine, this number can be quite
high. E.g., 1000 indexes on 80 core machine would have 80000 slice writers

When incremental build happens for most of these indexes, the waitPersist
method would wake-up all these slice writers as waitPersist writes to
workerDone ch and expects a response from them. This happens every 10ms
adding significant overhead to golang runtime.

To reduce this overhead, this patch proposes a new "flushDone" message from
flusher to each of the slices that processed mutations. The check for
waitPersist now happens based on the number of flushDone messages received.
The protocol followed is:

a. Whenever flusher finishes flushing the vbucket, it sends a message to
each slice that it has finished flush for that vbucket
b. This message also includes the total number of such flush done messages
to expect from flusher - as flusher will attempt a flush only if there is
any change to vbucket seqnos
c. Each slice up-on receiving this message will increment it's counter and
compares it with the expected number of such flushDone messages it has to
receive. Once both these counters match, then flush is considered done i.e.
slice has processed all mutations send by the flusher

These counters get reset at the start of every flush. To enable this reset,
slice keeps a track of two timestamps: lastMutProcessedTime - The time at
which last mutation has been processed by a slice and
lastFlushDoneProcessedTime - Time time at which last flush done message has
been processed by a slice.

As per the protocol, the flushDone message has to be the last message that
can be processed by a slice for every flush. If flusher has received all
such flushDone messages and if a mutation is processed after the last
flush done message is received, it marks the start of a new flush.

With this patch, the incremental index build performance has been increased
from 36 min to 25min for 3000 indexes on a node. The CPU utilisation has
come down as well
