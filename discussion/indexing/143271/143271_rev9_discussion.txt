DESCRIPTION:

Update waitPersist logic based on flushDone messages from flusher

The total slice writers in indexer equals num_indexes * num_cores. With
large number of indexes on high cores machine, this number can be quite
high. E.g., 1000 indexes on 80 core machine would have 80000 slice
writers

When incremental build happens for most of these indexes, the
waitPersist method would wake-up all these slice writers as waitPersist
writes to workerDone ch and expects a response from them. This happens
every 10ms adding significant overhead to golang runtime.

To reduce this overhead, this patch proposes two new messages:
a. opFlusherFlushStart - Sent at the begining of flush, per vbucket for
every slice
b. opFlusherFlushDone - Sent at the end of flush indicating that flush
has been completed

The protocol followed is:

a. Whenever flusher starts flushing a mutation for a slice, it sends a
opFlusherFlushStart message for the slice
b. Slice would increment the flushCounter upon receipt of this message
c. Whenever flusher finishes flushing for a vbucket, it sends
opFlusherFlushEnd message for all the slices to which it has sent a
opFlusherFlushStart message
d. Slice would decrement the flushCounter upon receipt of this message

All the workers are considered to be done when the flushCounter comes
back to zero. With this patch, the incremental index build performance
has been increased from 36 min to 25min for 3000 indexes on a node. The
CPU utilisation has come down as well
