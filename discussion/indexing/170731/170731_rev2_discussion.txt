DESCRIPTION:

MB-47552: Add error errStoragePathNotFound during plasma recovery

 There can be two possible reasons for error in the MB:

 a)Crash during index creation in deferred mode, followed by recovery

 b)Underlying file-system is unreliable

 Since plasma cannot tell from itself whether it is (a)/(b), we return
 fatal error. Currently indexer treats any fatal error from plasma as
 storage corruption, which is not the case with (a). This error check
 helps to distinguish the type of fatal error and can help indexer to
 log appropriate error message

 TBD: discuss with indexing team
