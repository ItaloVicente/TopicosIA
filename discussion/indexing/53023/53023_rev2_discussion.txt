DESCRIPTION:

MB-15204 Skip BucketNotFound for Stream in PrepareRecovery

In PrepareRecovery phase, all streams are stopped. After prepare is done,
recovery is initiated and bucket validation is done. There can be other
components(retrying MTR, restartVb in timekeeper) which can independently
detect bucketNotFound. If indexer sees this event in prepareRecovery it can
be skipped as streams have already been stopped. Recovery will do bucket
validation and cleanup if required.
