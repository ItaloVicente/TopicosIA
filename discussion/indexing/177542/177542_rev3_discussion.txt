Line:117, secondary/tests/ci/scripts/dobuild -> Is this required for both EE and CE builds. Why not we just do this after EE build is done as the info during CE build is anyways overwritten.

We can probably add the echo "Build $SUFFIX finished" to indicate that the build has finished

Line:126, secondary/tests/ci/scripts/dobuild -> IF there is ~/.reference and no repo, then mkdir would fail with directory already exists error. Can you handle this?
