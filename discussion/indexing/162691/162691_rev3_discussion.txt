Line:354, secondary/indexer/settings.go -> I think we should have this code after the settings have been updated

Line:23, secondary/logging/systemevent/system_event.go -> Instead of hardcoding values like 2048, 2049, can we do:

Approach 1:
EVENTID_INDEXER_SETTINGS_CHANGE      sel.EventId = 2048
EVENTID_PROJECTOR_SETTINGS_CHANGE    = EVENTID_INDEXER_SETTINGS_CHANGE + 1
EVENTID_QUERY_CLIENT_SETTINGS_CHANGE = EVENTID_PROJECTOR_SETTINGS_CHANGE + 1

Approach 2:
EVENTID_INDEXER_SETTINGS_CHANGE      sel.EventId = itoa + 2048
...
EVENTID_INDEXING_LIMIT = 3071

It becomes easy to add new events and we do not have to change EVENTID_UNDEFINED everytime we add a new event

Line:83, secondary/logging/systemevent/system_event.go -> I think it is a good idea to set UserAgent for the client so that it becomes easy to track it

Line:117, secondary/logging/systemevent/system_event.go -> Where are we using this?

Line:118, secondary/queryport/client/settings.go -> I think we should have this code after handleSettings i.e. generate an event after the setting has actually changed

Line:354, secondary/indexer/settings.go -> Can do that.. Any specific reason for suggesting so ? By this time the setting is already in metakv right so even if we restart at this point we should get back the setting.

Line:23, secondary/logging/systemevent/system_event.go -> I used iota in the initial patches but moved to this after seeing a comment in eventing review. Found out that the value of EventID made things less error prone on addition of a new event and more easy to read. EventIDs should not be changed once assigned. 

I can get back to the iota way if needed..

Line:83, secondary/logging/systemevent/system_event.go -> Sure will do that.

Line:117, secondary/logging/systemevent/system_event.go -> We are using this on other files where we added event like systemevent.InfoEvent

Line:118, secondary/queryport/client/settings.go -> Will update that. Any reason for thinking so ?

Line:354, secondary/indexer/settings.go -> Having an event log on a setting confirms that the setting has been applied. Isn't that the requirement from ns_server?

Line:23, secondary/logging/systemevent/system_event.go -> In the current logic, if we add a new event, then EVENTID_UNDEFINED's value will change. It is error prone as a user can forget changing the value - especially when adding multiple events.

iota simplifies as long as the ordering of event does not change in the code. I think you can write a simple CI test to guarantee the ordering.

Other approach is to comment in the code that EVENTID_UNDEFINED should be +1 to the last event defined. Either way is fine for me.

Line:83, secondary/logging/systemevent/system_event.go -> Thanks. Sorry, I missed those statements.

Line:118, secondary/queryport/client/settings.go -> Having the system event generated after the setting has been applied confirms the application of setting

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:83, secondary/logging/systemevent/system_event.go -> User-agent seems to be a request header and requests are created in the systemeventlog library. Will update library to add support for custom request headers and add this in next patch.
