DESCRIPTION:

MB-36254 Fix replica presence check log partition stats when alter index test fails

After dropping or decrementing replica count, wait for repilca to
get dropped (wait up to 5 minutes) and only then initiate the scan.
In some cases, if the replica drop takes more than 10 seconds, then
scans can go the the replica that is about to be dropped and the
test will fail with incorrect number of scans for replicas that
are present

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:226, secondary/tests/functionaltests/set15_alter_test.go -> Isn't 5 mins too long? Ideally drop should not take more than 2 mins.
