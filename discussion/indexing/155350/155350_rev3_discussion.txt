DESCRIPTION:

MB-46772 Fix bookkeeping problems in timekeeper.removeIndexFromStream()

This fixes several problems with streamKeyspaceIdIndexCountMap[][]
bookkeeping done by timekeeper.removeIndexFromStream(). The first two
of these could cause the message "Timekeeper::removeIndexFromStream
Invalid Internal State Detected. Index Count Underflow" to be logged.
The third is to reduce the log level.

1. Only try to do bookkeeping if the instance being removed from the
   stream actually was in the stream. (It might not be if there were
   multiple drops in flight concurrently, such as one "drop index"
   and another "drop collection" the index is in.)

2. Only try to do bookkeeping if the corresponding map entry exists.
   (It might not if a concurrent "drop collection" deleted it already.)

3. Change "Fatal" log message to "Error" as it is not fatal. (There is
   no functional impact even if this error is ever hit again.)
