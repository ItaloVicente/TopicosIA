Patch Set 5:

Patchset 5 drops "injected" licenses in files that previously had no license comment at all. It also seems to have dropped secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go; I'm not sure why - perhaps the license comment in that file wasn't recognized as one it could legitimately replace.

@Amit please resume reviewing; we need to get this done this week, ideally before Thursday.

Patch Set 5: Code-Review+2

Hi Ceej,

+2. 

Next steps:

A lot of files without copyright have a single primary contributor. The plan is to get the all such files copyrighted next. Please let me know if there is any timeline for that. 

Thanks.

Build/Legal/PM don't have any timeline for anything beyond this current phase 1 of BSL. I know Dave Finlay has been pushing to also include the license text for any third-party code that is in the repositories. Are the single-contributor files you're talking about third-party? Or are they written by individuals inside Couchbase? If it's the latter, they should get the Couchbase BSL license at this point.

No. These files will be Couchbase only.

After submitting this, I'll raise a second change with the "inject" option enabled - that will add the couchbase BSL text to all files with no existing license. You could review those and see if you think any should not be marked as such at this time.

Sure. We will review that and will post the comments mentioning which files can be safely licensed on that review request.
