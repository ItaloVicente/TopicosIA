Patch Set 3:

Are there any guidelines on code snippets that may have been copied from the internet in the past ?

It will be difficult to figure out if that has happened in the past - as we may not have required history. So, I believe it will be safe to avoid adding new license to the files which do not have any license.

For the files, with existing license, we can decide to migrate to the new license.

We can, I believe, re-run the script and have it only update files with an existing Couchbase license (although unfortunately Blair just left for a 4-day weekend so it may need to wait until next week now). We can also provide you a list of files that were missing any license so you can start the process of identifying anything that is definitely ours or definitely not.
