> 1. secondary/indexer/scan-coordinator.go is missing the first line in the current license. So, the changes triggered by the script did not take effect. We need to fix this. The changeset that lead to missing first line is: https://github.com/couchbase/indexing/commit/52a68c7d89b4f561e1870635ba68cea60738ce47#diff-a2e6ac258eabd7ebad68000a7bdf554a15c802e0ae9e4773ae78c972ab976833

> 2. ".proto" files are not handled. I was looking in the protobuf source code and I found at least one .proto file which has license information https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/google/protobuf/any.proto
> I think to be on safer side, we can add the license info to proto files as well.

Thank you, I've manually removed the Apache2 license from scan-coordinator, and included .proto files.
