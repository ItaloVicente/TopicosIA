Reviewed till secondary/indexer. Will continue reviewing this.
Line:1, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> Is 2017 correct starting year ?

Line:1, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> The years are based on the git history, if there isn't a prior copyright date in the file. It's mostly information and carries basically no Legal weight anyway, so best-effort is fine.

Reviewed until 
secondary/tests/functionaltests/set03_planner_test.go

After this file, the license was added to many file which do not have any existing license. 

for example, some files in 
secondary/tests/functionaltests and secondary/tools folders.

I think this should be fixed.

It is correct behaviour that the license was added to files without any existing license. If any of those files are *wrong* (not Couchbase-owned), or even if you're not positive whether they're Couchbase-owned or not, just let us know which files or directories that we should ignore.

Patch Set 4:

Hi,

As I mentioned in the previous comment, it will be a time consuming activity to verify unlicensed files as of now. 

So, we discussed this within GSI team meeting that - at this point in time, is will be safer to g with "update-only" approach.

We can keep adding licenses to unlicensed file later.

As per the above comment by Blair Watt, the patch set 4 was intended to do the same. i.e. "Patch 4 reflects modifications to existing headers (with no new header injections) "

But some files were still got licensed with new license without having old license.

I see. OK, in that case, hopefully we can re-run (and re-base) this change suppressing all "new" injected licenses.
