DESCRIPTION:

MB-44764 Use worker pool to generate snapshots for MAINT_STREAM

Current worker pool implementation is round-robin in nature
This is done to make sure that only one message can be broadcasted
to all workers for this stream keyspaceID. Other, a separate message
has to be sent to each worker containing an instance for which snapshot
has to be generated and this is not performance efficient.

Each worker will pick an instance based on workerId and the number
of instances for which the snapshots are to be generated. If the
number of instances are more than the number of workers, then
the worker will pick the instance at location `workerId + numSnapshotWokrer`
in the next iteration. For each iteration, worker will advance the
index by `numSnapshotWoker` value

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:638, secondary/indexer/storage_manager.go -> Hey Amit, so the iterCount is initialised to "0" for every message. After a message is received, if there are say 100 indexes and 5 workers, then worker-0 will pick up the 0,5,10,15,... instances. Worker-1 will pick-up 1,6,11,... instances. In each iteration iterCount gets incremented by "5". After processing all the instances, we break from the for loop and start waiting for the message again - so iterCount will be reset automatically
