DESCRIPTION:

MB-41179 Increase timeout when waiting for indexer in metadata provider

When metadata provider starts, it starts watcher. When watcher starts,
it syncs up the metadata and index definition information from peers.
Only after this sync, watcher will be considered ready.

When there are large number of indexes, this sync can take time. Currently,
metadata provider waits for 1 sec for this sync up to finish. After this
1 sec, metadata provider will assign a temporary ID to indexer and
continue to wait in the back-ground for watcher to become ready. If there
is any update topology call in the meantime, it would use the temporary ID
causing the "indexer node...not available error" and "cannot locate cluster
node" errors
