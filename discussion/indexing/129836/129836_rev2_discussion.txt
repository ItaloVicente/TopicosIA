We have more optimized versions of Debugf/Tracef in our logging package. Please check LazyDebug/LazyTrace. These optimizations are part of the server but yet to make its way to the client.

Btw, thanks a lot for taking out the time to look at this!

Glad to hear that, but the point still remains that even if we have a better Tracef / Debugf, a string should not be assigned to a a variable and then passed to a function, because the golang escape algorithm will allocate the variable to the heap and not on the frame.
This is because the function call may require a stack reallocation, and if we had references from the frame, we would panic, as said references would point to the old frame and not the new.

To give you an idea,

	fmsg := "Scan port %s for index defnID %d of equivalent index defnId %d"
	logging.Debugf(fmsg, qp, targetDefnID, defnID)

(in meta_client.go:415) in 5 minutes of execution, allocates fmsg on the heap 30 million times, for a total of 5GB.
This is all memory that needs to be cleaned and loads the GC.
To put it in perspective, this is equivalent to 30% of the memory we allocate fetching actual documents (which in 5 minutes is 16.4GB).

	logging.Debugf("Scan port %s for index defnID %d of equivalent index defnId %d", qp, targetDefnID, defnID)

solves the problem completely.
As a general rule, in golang, *never* assign to a variable what you can use as a constant.
There are many blogs that describe all of the escape algorithm pitfalls in detail.

Completely agree with that Marco.

On the server side, we follow the below convention to avoid the overheads completely.

logging.LazyDebug(func() string {
         return fmt.Sprintf("KVSender::handleOpenStream %v %v %v",
             streamId, keyspaceId, cmd)
})

I'll file a ticket to review that this is happening at all places. 

Feel free to submit this patch/more patches, whenever you are ready. Thanks!
