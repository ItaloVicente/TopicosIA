Patch Set 1:

Following my tests on Q2, these are the bare minimum changes that fix memory allocations on Q2.
The Debugf() using a variable seems harmless enough, but during the course of a run, it escapes 1GB per minute to the heap.
This is a known issue with the golang escape analysis algorithm.
The changes take Q2 from 88K requests per second to 101K, and max latency from 4ms to 3ms,
This is the first time that an index scan query exceeds 100k sec!

As I am profiling more I'll see if there are more low hanging fruits that I could pick.
