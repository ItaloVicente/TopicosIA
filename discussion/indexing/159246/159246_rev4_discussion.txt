DESCRIPTION:

MB-47689 : Reduce cinfoMaxRetries and fetchBucketInfoOnURIHashChangeOnly

* Number of retries are huge as of today which is overloading ns_server
  when the requests are already timing out.
* As we added FetchBucketInfo function in getLocalVBuckets function we
  no longer need to watch rebalance changes in cinfo of projector.
  So we can only fetch the data when there is URI hash value change
  here.

Line:105, secondary/projector/projector.go -> Once the retry limit is exhausted, projector is going to cleanup the keyspace and indexer will need to set it up again. Till the ns-server side problem gets resolved, this loop will continue. I guess we may want to consider increasing the sleep interval between the retries rather than reducing the number of retries, unless there is an added benefit of cleaning up the keyspace in projector.
