DESCRIPTION:

MB-47689 : Reduce cinfoMaxRetries and fetchBucketInfoOnURIHashChangeOnly

* Number of retries are huge as of today which is overloading ns_server
  when the requests are already timing out.
* As we added FetchBucketInfo function in getLocalVBuckets function we
  no longer need to watch rebalance changes in cinfo of projector.
  So we can only fetch the data when there is URI hash value change
  here.
