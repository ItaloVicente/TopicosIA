DESCRIPTION:

MB-36237: Protect against duplicate index in case of with nodes

When with nodes clause is specified during index creation, during
prepare phase, only specified nodes are used. This can lead to
duplicate index names when index creation with same name is
attempted from the different query service, and with different
with node parameter.

Similar situation (duplicate index name) can also occur due to
subset of nodes being considered during planning. The "most reliable"
duplicate index check happens duing planning, and planner working
on only a subset of nodes can lead to duplicate index creation.

The fix for the first part is to use all indexer nodes during prepare
phase, so that there is no possibility of concurrent index creation
and only one instance of planner will be running in the entire cluster.
Note: using only a subset of indexer nodes during prepare phase can
be used as a workaround to create multiple indexes concurrently. To
avoid regressing from that behavior, as new setting flag is introduced.
To create multiple indexes concurrently, this flag has to be set
explicitly.

For the second part, during planning phase, force duplicate
index check to use all available indexer nodes in cluster.
This happens before actual call to ExecutePlan so, ExecutePlan
does not need to perform the duplicate index check once again.

Note: Planner is responsible for checking duplicate index name.
