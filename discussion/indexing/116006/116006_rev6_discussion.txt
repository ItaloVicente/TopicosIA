DESCRIPTION:

MB-36237: Protect against duplicate index in case of with nodes

When with nodes clause is specified during index creation, during
prepare phase, only specified nodes are used. This can lead to
duplicate index names when index creation with same name is
attempted from the different query service, and with different
with node parameter.

Similar situation (duplicate index name) can also occur due to
subset of nodes being considered during planning. The "most reliable"
duplicate index check happens duing planning, and planner working
on only a subset of nodes can lead to duplicate index creation.

The fix is to:
Move check for duplicate index to the indexer. During prepare phase,
lifecycle manager will check for the presence of duplicate index
in local metadata repo. If duplicate index is present, the prepare
request will be rejected. Also use all indexer nodes during prepare
phase, so that the duplicate index check will happen on all nodes.

Note: using only a subset of indexer nodes during prepare phase can
be used as a workaround to create multiple indexes concurrently. To
avoid regressing from that behavior, a new setting flag called
"indexer.allowPartialQuorum" is introduced. To create multiple indexes
concurrently (using with nodes), this flag has to be set explicitly.

Change-Id: I280cab7192bc9d48643f710355938e9daf4f12a3
Note: Planner is responsible for checking duplicate index name.

Line:75, secondary/indexer/ddl_service_manager.go -> typo in quorum. you can remove it from here as well.

Line:475, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> need one more format specifier for err

Line:483, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> what happens today if a delete state index with same name is present and create index is done without any node list?

Line:483, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> I did further analysis on this.

As of today, the duplicate index check happens at three places.
1. Metadata Provider
2. Planner
3. Indexer

1. Metadata Provider relaxes the duplicate index check for indexes in NIL, CREATED, DELETED and ERROR states.
2. Planner relaxes the duplicate index check for indexes in NIL, CREATED, DELETED and ERROR states.
3. Indexer relaxes the duplicate index check only for DELETED indexes.

Having said that, GetIndexDefnByName uses defnCache to check for duplicate index. defnCache is synchronously updated every time index is created/deleted/updated. On delete index, defnCache cache entry also gets deleted. So, using defnCache is not a problem. Also, the same function GetIndexDefnByName is used by duplicate defnId and instId checks as well. So, prepare request will never get rejected for DELETED indexes. And, we can reject prepare request if the indexDefn (as per defnCache) is in NIL, CREATED and ERROR states (as if we don't allow, the request can get rejected when it reaches indexer).

As per the comment in planner code https://github.com/couchbase/indexing/blob/master/secondary/planner/proxy.go#L288, the indexes in the states NIL, CREATED or ERROR will get cleaned up eventually. So, user retry should succeed eventually.

So, there is no need for code change.
