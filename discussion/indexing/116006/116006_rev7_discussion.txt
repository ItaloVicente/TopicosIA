DESCRIPTION:

MB-36237: Protect against duplicate index in case of with nodes

When with nodes clause is specified during index creation, during
prepare phase, only specified nodes are used. This can lead to
duplicate index names when index creation with same name is
attempted from the different query service, and with different
with node parameter.

Similar situation (duplicate index name) can also occur due to
subset of nodes being considered during planning. The "most reliable"
duplicate index check happens duing planning, and planner working
on only a subset of nodes can lead to duplicate index creation.

The fix is to:
Move check for duplicate index to the indexer. During prepare phase,
lifecycle manager will check for the presence of duplicate index
in local metadata repo. If duplicate index is present, the prepare
request will be rejected. Also use all indexer nodes during prepare
phase, so that the duplicate index check will happen on all nodes.

Note: using only a subset of indexer nodes during prepare phase can
be used as a workaround to create multiple indexes concurrently. To
avoid regressing from that behavior, a new setting flag called
"indexer.allowPartialQuorum" is introduced. To create multiple indexes
concurrently (using with nodes), this flag has to be set explicitly.

Line:481, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> isn't it better to return the exact error from the server in the prepare  response so a discrete error can be provided to the user and it is easier to understand the situation? We may not be able to do it for all cases but whenever it is possible. You can file it as a future enhancement.
