DESCRIPTION:

MB-36237: Protect against duplicate index in case of with nodes

When with nodes clause is specified during index creation, during
prepare phase, only specified nodes are used. This can lead to
duplicate index names when index creation with same name is
attempted from the different query service, and with different
with node parameter.

The fix will use all indexer nodes in prepare phase, so that
there is no possibility of concurrent index creation and
only one instance of planner will be running in the entire
cluster.

Change-Id: I280cab7192bc9d48643f710355938e9daf4f12a3
Note: Planner is responsible for checking duplicate index name.
