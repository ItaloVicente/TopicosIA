DESCRIPTION:

MB-55062 Unlock all locked shards at the end of rebalance

During rebalance, shards can be locked during:

a. Transfer to destination node
b. Recovery on destination node

If rebalance fails while the shard is being recovered, then
the shards on source node has to be unlocked and the recovered
data on destination node has to be deleted. Since there is only
one token tracking the state, it is possible for the following
race condition to happen:

a. Destination node has read all transfesr tokens from metaKV
b. Destination node has removed all local instances and deleted
   the metaKV token
c. Source node tries to read metaKV tokens for cleanup

As the token is removed at step (b), source not may not find the
token and it will skip unlocking the shards. The issue is happening
because both source and destination node are taking different
actions on a single transfer token while the other node can
potentially delete the token.

To avoid these race conditions, shard transfer manager keeps a track
of all shards that are locked during rebalance. At the end of rebalance,
rebalance service manager will call "RestoreAndUnlockShards" API
which will unlock all shards that are present on the node and yet to be
unlocked due to rebalance. This ensures that all shards are properly
unlocked at the end of rebalance.

If any shard is destroyed during cleanup, it will be skipped from
unlocking as unlock is not required for a shard that is destroyed.
