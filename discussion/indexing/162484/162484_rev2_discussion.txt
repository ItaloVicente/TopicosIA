(10 comments)
Line:28, secondary/indexer/autofailover_service_manager.go -> Why unsafe.Pointer and why not uint64 directly?

Line:152, secondary/indexer/autofailover_service_manager.go -> Do we have to return diskFailures even if autoFailover is disabled?

Line:175, secondary/indexer/autofailover_service_manager.go -> Minor: logPrefix is the name used in the rest of the code

Line:33, secondary/indexer/cpu_throttle.go -> Why an unsafe.Pointer and why not in32 directly?

Line:35, secondary/indexer/cpu_throttle.go -> Same comment as above

Line:127, secondary/indexer/cpu_throttle.go -> Minor: I think comments like these can be avoided. I am not against comments, but some comments like these can be avoided. The person who is reading this code is expected to have some knowledge of what is going on. 

In my opinion, we should comment only if we are trying to describe a logic that is difficult to comprehend by reading code.

Line:185, secondary/indexer/cpu_throttle.go -> Minor: 0 - normalizer is more efficient

Line:316, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Minor: Typo

Line:2845, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Very Minor: Some white lines are kept for better code readability. You can leave it if you like. What is better readability is a subjective thing. So, it is totally upto you

Line:2765, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Please do not change the code that is not a part of the feature you are developing. Otherwise, it becomes difficult for review. In this case, gerrit shows a huge code change block but nothing has actually changed.

You can open a separate patch to fix this - just not in the same patch in which you are proposing a new code change.

Line:28, secondary/indexer/autofailover_service_manager.go -> Those would pull in a dependency on the stats package, when all I need is a regular unsafe pointer to a native type. Those stats classes also contain more than just the value -- they also contain a stats-related bitmap, which is not needed here. So I think usign those would add unnecessary overhead and complexity.

Line:107, secondary/indexer/autofailover_service_manager.go -> No, Varun, the replica ID should not be included because the purpose of the computation this function is used for is to determine, for every partition in a to-be-failed-over node, if there is at least one copy of it on a surviving node. Thus all replicas on a set of nodes need to be ORed together when computing the sets.

Line:152, secondary/indexer/autofailover_service_manager.go -> Yes, so the user can see the disk failures stat even if they have not decided to enable Autofailover. This is why ns_server calls this API even when Autofailover is off, and originally they were not even going to pass an autofailoverEnabled flag -- that is only passed per my request so GSI can enable/disable CPU throttling.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:175, secondary/indexer/autofailover_service_manager.go -> logPrefix in many places is not really the same thing. E.g. in dataport/servergo it is created by the NewServer constructor as

	s.logPrefix = fmt.Sprintf("DATP[->dataport %q]", laddr)

and has nothing to do with the method name. Several other files I sampled (e.g. projector/feed.go, queryport/server.go, n1ql/secondary_index.go) had similar constructor-time definitions unrelated to method name and usually including argument values. So it seems logPrefix is often something other than method name, whereas when I create a "method" constant it is always local and always the method name. I have been using "method" in all the files I've changed over several features that did not already have something like this, and they have been approved that way. Thus I think it is better to keep this name for this usage.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:31, secondary/indexer/cpu_throttle.go -> Jeelan, my thought is that goutils is not part of the indexer/ repository, and it does not seem likely this class will ever be used again, thus not worth the added git complexity of putting it into a different repository. If another project wants to use it we could move it then. However, note it is actually somewhat risky to have more than one service sharing a node do CPU throttling as this could lead to pathological behaviors such as oscillation or chaotic (in the technical sense) behavior.

Line:127, secondary/indexer/cpu_throttle.go -> I am not denying you of comments. I am only saying that too many comments also makes the code cluttered. Like I mentioned earlier, the person who is reading the code is expected to understand what atomic.LoadInt64 does and shouldn't require an explanation on how it functions. If understanding that is a difficulty, then it is a different problem which we should address.

I suggest you to read through: https://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-without-comments/. I do not endorse all the comments, but I feel majority of the comments are valid.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:127, secondary/indexer/cpu_throttle.go -> Commenting what things do is necessary to increase code maintainability and supportability. Even the original author will forget what most code does in a surprisingly short amount of time (less than six months). Humans read natural language much better than programming languages, so having good comments greatly speeds up the development and maintenance and helps both avoid injecting bugs and in finding existing bugs. (It is much easier to check if code does what a comment says than to figure out what uncommented code is intended to do, and if there is a discrepancy it is often a strong clue that the code contains a bug. This is similar to how many NP-Complete problems have polynomial-time algorithms to check if a given proposed solution is correct.) In this case there is an additional need to distinguish two different accessor methods whose names sound like they might do the same thing -- these comments can help avoid bugs in the future.

Also note that IDEs will show the comments in a popup when you hover over an instance of the function call, so you don't have to keep jumping to functions to read them and see what they do.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:127, secondary/indexer/cpu_throttle.go -> I agree these would not need comments if there was only one getter and it did the normal thing. The point of the comments on GetActiveThrottleDelayMs() and getThrottleDelayMs() is there are two getters that both sound like they might do the normal thing, but one of them does something different. A developer might not notice that there are two of these but just notice the existence of a getter method that sounds like it does what they want and so call it without a second thought, and if they got the wrong one it causes a bug. Thus I very intentionally added comments on both of them pointing out the difference and cross referencing them.

Line:185, secondary/indexer/cpu_throttle.go -> They probably both compile to the same machine code as this is just a negation and the compiler likely checks for these special cases. Now I find Go allows "-normalizer" syntax so will change these to that and it will certainly do whatever is the most efficient machine code.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2845, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> I try to keep related code together for better readability, e.g. the calculation of a value (including err returned from a call) and the "if" check of the same value. Having the assignment and check separated by a blank line makes them look like independent actions and encourages other code to get inserted in between them until a bug creeps in because the error or other assigned value was not checked before something else was done that shouldn't have been.

Some GSI code has blank lines after almost every statement, which IMO decreases readability (like having no paragraphs in a large document) and makes a lot less code fit on the screen.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2765, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Maybe you have not noticed this, but Gerrit shows the actual changes in a darker color of red/green (left/right old/new). In this case the indentation changed, which is easy to see because the block is light green on the right pane and light pink on the left pane except for the darker red on left showing one tabstop has been deleted from each line.

This change is done to make the overall code more readable. I spent a lot of time in this function understanding it, and while I was there I took the time to improve the readability. We have to be free to do that or such improvements in general will never be done. It costs much more developer time to open another bug and come back to the same code later than just to improve it while already working on it. This is what's often called good "code hygiene."

In this method it was not very clear in its original structure that there were three big blocks and it would only ever execute one of them, because the first and third if-else-else blocks were quite long, and it was not immediately obvious that there was no more code following this big construct. Having the else in the middle be empty was also a little odd.

BTW I already went through this code refactoring change with Deep in a 1:1 Zoom session and he was fine with it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2765, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Good discussion. I take it as a positive that you haven't found any bugs in the review so far. Now I realize you might have been asking not to change files that don't have any feature code in them, whereas I originally read it as you not wanting anything touched that is not actual feature code. I agree in general with not changing unrelated files, and the files that are included with any feature I do are always because I was at least doing in-depth code investigation in those files (e.g. I might add comments to files even if I don't make any code changes in them). In this case there was originally significant Autofailover feature code implemented in this file. I realized last night that you would not be aware of that, so it seemed unrelated to you, but actually for the first 90% of this feature's development time most of the throttling and most of the code investigation was done in this file, and I had therefore done quite a few changes in the functions I touched here and spent many hours reading through this code to understand it and its interactions in that process. I spent more time in timekeeper.go for Autofailover than in any other already-existing source file, because how to add the throttling in this codepath was the most complex, with lots of dependencies and interactions, and this is where Deep said we needed throttling added for the mutation path.

Unit testing the feature with these throttle calls present ultimately proved they were problematic because they needed to release the timekeeper "god" mutex (tk.lock) before sleeping, and doing this in the middle of a timekeeper handler allows another handler to start running, and these then get into a race with each other in returning their generic MsgSuccess messages to indexer, resulting in chaos (all sorts of mysterious, severe, and random failures). I had tried many different variants, in the meanwhile doing the refactors you see to try to make the code more readable. In the end I had to come up with a brand new solution that removed the throttling calls from timekeeper.go and put replacements into mutation_manager.go. So now it turns out there is no Autofailover feature code in timekeeper.go, just a few small refactorings and added comments, plus deleting three methods I discovered were completely unused, thus simplifying future code archaeology.

If I had not already spent many hours working on this file as part of this feature, then I would not have included it in the feature at all, but now the work is already done as part of this feature work and already cost significant time, so I kept it here to avoid the additional time costs of opening a new task, cherry picking this file over to it, reverting it in this patch, doing another Gerrit patch for this second MB + CI Bot run, code review request, etc., as there would be no added benefit from doing that but significant added cost.

I hope this clarifies why this file is included in this feature patch!

Line:2765, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> I think you got me wrong. I am not denying of you of "code hygiene". I also understand that this is complex code and understanding it is more difficult - which is the precise reason why I am suggesting you to separate the concerns.

I do know how gerrit highlights code changes. In this case, it is easy to miss the dark green change (if there is any) due to the additional indentation change while there is no functional change in the code and this code change has nothing to do with autofailover.

You could have refactored this code change, raise a separate patch (By juts adding timekeeper refactoring code to the patch) on the same bug and continue with your changes for auto-failover. This makes the code review easier for reviewers.
