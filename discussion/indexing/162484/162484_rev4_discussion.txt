DESCRIPTION:

MB-44738 (7.1.0 1368) Autofailover for Index Service feature

Support Autofailover in Index service. This includes new APIs ns_server
calls through RPC (cbauth): HealthCheck(), IsSafe(Nodes) plus CPU
throttling to absorb workload spikes without becoming unresponsive.

For details see the spec:

Line:80, secondary/indexer/autofailover_service_manager.go -> getWithAuth has a default http timeout of 20mins. For the purpose of auto-failover, it may be better to have a smaller timeout. Do you know how long ns-server is going to wait for the request before timing it out?

Line:1025, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> It is better to sleep after adding the entry to streamFlusherStopChMap. Otherwise, handleAbortPersist may not find the stopCh entry during abort and return success without calling close(stopch).

Line:80, secondary/indexer/autofailover_service_manager.go -> This call is going to m.httpAddr which is the local node's loopback address, and the new &cachedMetaOnly=true flag tells getIndexStatus() to get everything from local cache instead of doing scatter-gather, so this whole call sequence will not contact any remote nodes and should therefore return in a few milliseconds. This is the point of implementing the cachedMetaOnly flag -- to avoid making network calls to other Index nodes.

ns_server is hoping to do the entire failover sequence within a few seconds. I don't know what specific timeout they are using but the user can set the Autofailover threshold as low as 5 seconds, so the ns_serbver timeout in that specific case is going to be at most a second or two. If ns_server's call times out on us that is fine, because we can't determine safety anyway until we get the topology. If we time out we will return "unsafe," and if it times out in ns_server instead they need to assume unsafe, so there's no real difference. However, if we were to set a very short timeout here but ns_server decided to use a longer timeout (e.g. because user set Autofailover threshold to 120 sec), then we'd be breaking ns_server's intent and might time ourselves out unnecessarily when ns_server was willing to wait longer, so I think it is better to keep the existing getWithAuth() timeout here.

Line:1025, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> We might need to discuss this as that change would make the sleep occur while holding the m.flock mutex. I will look more into what this mutex protects, but usually it's not a good idea to sleep while holding a mutex. The other alternative is to release it and reget it as I was trying to do in timekeeper, but that is not always safe. (Meanwhile I will also delete the "then recheck newTSDue" as that is cut-and-paste cruft from when this was in timekeeper.)

Line:80, secondary/indexer/autofailover_service_manager.go -> Even with cachedMetaOnly, getIndexStatus needs to get the RLock for cinfo, which may become a contention point under stress/cinfo update taking longer after ns-server notification.

Line:1025, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> How about adding the sleep to anonymous go function in line 1038?

Line:80, secondary/indexer/autofailover_service_manager.go -> #2 should be fine. It would be good to discuss with ns-server team also, so they are on the same page.

For the getIndexStatus, if cachedMetaOnly is true, it would be better for the implementation to completely avoid using cinfo cache(which looks like the most likely place this call is going to run into contention).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:80, secondary/indexer/autofailover_service_manager.go -> That is true, however it does not change the reasoning. Even if it were a non-REST API (and thus did not even have capability of a timeout), it could take longer than we want, and getting everything from local cache is the best we can do. The analysis should be around what happens with different timeout scenarios, which break down to three cases:
1. Nobody's timeout gets triggered (and thus it doesn't matter whose is longer).
2. GSI has a longer timeout than ns_server, and ns_server's timeout gets triggered.
3. GSI has a shorter timeout than ns_server, and GSI's timeout gets triggered.

In #1 everybody is happy, so we don't have to think about it beyond that.

In #2 "unsafe" is assumed, but GSI tried as hard as it could to give an answer for the full time alotment ns_server was willing to let it compute.

In #3 "unsafe" is also assumed, however GSI gave up more quickly than ns_server required, so perhaps it could have finished the calculation in time to reply to ns_server if it hadn't self-imposed a shorter timeout. Thus the self-imposed shorter timeout might return "unsafe" even if it would have been possible to finish the calculation and maybe discover that the correct answer was "safe."

Thus choosing between #2 and #3, #2 is clearly better. If ns_server uses a really short timeout, that is fine because they are the ones in charge of deciding how long they want to give this Autofailover attempt before taking some default (in)action, but if GSI uses a really short timeout that just introduces more incorrect decisions than would occur under #2.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1025, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> Thanks, that works, so done. My investigations show the m.flock mutex is only really protecting the m.streamFlusherStopChMap itself so could be permanently released immediately after updating the map, but pushing the sleep into the anon function avoids any risk of opening a timing window related to m.flusherWaitGroup.Add(1) and launching the anon goroutine. It also means I can put it after the start time is set so no longer need to manually tweak the flush latency stat at the end.
