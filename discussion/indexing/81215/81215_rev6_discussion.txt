Line:1889, secondary/common/config.go -> You could rename this to 
indexer.api.enableTestServer

Basically it can be internal setting which does not show up in rest  API :9102/settings.

Line:1058, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Why do we need this? This code runs in NewIndexer( .. ) which runs only during boot , so we dont this check..

Line:1889, secondary/common/config.go -> The main motivation for keeping it under settings was that we can use ChangeIndexerSettings(...) in the test framework. I haven't seen 9102/settings documented anyway, so I thought it is considered "private". I can shift it to api and write another helper function in the test framework if that's a better option.

Line:1058, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> We spawn the Rest server handling /api/stats (Public endpoints) during spawn, and only spawn the QE Rest server during a config change. Since config/ settings changes can be issued multiple times, we need to check if it is already running

Line:1889, secondary/common/config.go -> Could you please try out ChangeIndexSettings for setting internal setting? It should work

Line:1058, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Where is the code change to spawn QE REST server when this setting is set to true?

Line:1058, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> I missed that this code change is in handleConfigChange. I was under the impression this is in NewIndexer()

Line:53, secondary/tests/perftests/common_test.go -> Is there a specific reason why this line of code is moved up?

Line:1889, secondary/common/config.go -> Lets keep this as an internal setting. All settings can be changed via rest api.
