DESCRIPTION:

MB-53711:Indexing Restore Improvements for Elixir Part 1

1. Modified findIndexToRestore(). In serverless mode we only need indexes per DefnID as on posting and building the indexes one replica will be created by default.
	a. If an index with the same name exists in metadata consider only the first occurence for restore.
	b. If an equivalent index exists in the current cluster, skip restoring that index without having to check for partition and replicas.

2. Implemented functions convertIndexestoSchedTokens() and makeScheduleCreateRequest() to convert Restore Candidates to Schedule Create Tokens, selecting Indexer node to post restore tokens to and to post tokens.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Please mention the various test scenarios covered in commit message or in another document. 
Line:755, secondary/manager/restore.go -> Is this enough? We need to set defer build to true in the index defn as well. Isn't it?

Line:776, secondary/manager/restore.go -> Same as above. Do we need to call findIndexer here?

Line:782, secondary/manager/restore.go -> This code can be deduplicated with above code.

Line:803, secondary/manager/restore.go -> Please create a subtask MB to post multiple schedule create tokens in a single HTTP call to a specific indexer. This will reduce the overall turnaround time.
