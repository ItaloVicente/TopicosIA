DESCRIPTION:

MB-50793 Provide global API for security config change

When there are no buckets in the cluster and there is a security
change, query will not refresh the GSI client but client tries to
connect to indexer. Indexer will reject the connection as indexer
expects TLS connection but client starts a non-TLS connection (as
the security config is not refreshed by query)

This patch along with https://review.couchbase.org/c/query/+/170043
fixes the issue by providing a global API to refresh the client side
security config even when there are no keyspaces
