DESCRIPTION:

MB-50006 Force snapshot generation with maintFlushTs from timekeeper

A race condition is possible with the fix made for MB-46068.

a. Indexer got to handleMergeInitStream, sent a message to storage
   manager to force snapshot for INIT_STREAM
b. Storage manager processed the request, and spawned a go-routine.
   Now, say this go-routine is not scheduled or paused
c. Indexer finishes handleMergeInitStream, merges the index to
   MAINT_STREAM and enables flush for MAINT_STREAM
d. If more mutations come, snapshotting for MAINT_STREAM will start
   happening
e. Now, if go-routine from (b) wakes up, then there will be two
   go-routines doing snapshotting for the same index at the same
   time and this can break our invariants

The current patch solves this by using the following approach:

a. Instead of timekeeper asking indexer to force snapshot at the
   time of merge, timekeeper will send a stability timestamp to
   indexer with FORCE_COMMIT snapshot type
b. Indexer will ask storage manager to generate in-memory snapshot
   and also persist snapshot
c. Once snapshot is generated, indexer will get STORAGE_SNAP_DONE
   message which will be forwarded to indexer, which will send it
   to timekeeper
d. Timekeeper will again check for checkInitStreamReadyToMerge() but
   this time it sees init and maint FlushTs are same - as flush is
   disabled in part (a), there won’t be any new flushes.
   Hence, initFlushTs and maintFlushTs will become same
e. Now, timekeeper asks indexer to merge the stream
