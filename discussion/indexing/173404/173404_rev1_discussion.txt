DESCRIPTION:

MB-50660: Implement handler for getInternalVersion for n1ql client

Backport MB-50323 to 7.0.4

ns_server allows services to comprehend only major and minor
versions (i.e. the first two components of the version string).
The third component of the version string typically represents
a patch version.

In some rare case scenarios, services need to defferentiate
between different patch versions of same major/minor version.
To support this, indexing has implemented an internal version
mechanism, located at indexing/secondary/common/internal_version.go.

The first implementation of this internal version only supported
version check across indexer nodes. But with requirements like
auth enforcement, the internal version check should include
query service nodes as well.

This code change implements an http handler for getting internal
version of the gsi n1ql client.
