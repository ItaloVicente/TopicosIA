DESCRIPTION:

MB-36704 : Validate max_cpu_percent value when changed

setting.go - max_cpu_percent is being used to set NumEvictorThreads value of Plasma.
If this value is greater then number of logical CPUs plasma is running into
index out of range issue. Returning error when user tries to set max_cpu_percent
to greater than runtime.NumCPU()

util.go - When user updates "Indexer Threads" from UI. Indexer gets the updates
in metaKvCallback as max_cpu_percent so limiting the max possible value to
runtime.NumCPU() and printing a Warning in the log.

Note: This will limit the user from setting Idexer Threads to > runtime.NumCPU()
UI Currenlty will not show error for this and the value from UI will get
updated giving use the wrong impression of using the value that is set.

secondaryindexstats.go - Adding logic to error out when a non 2XX response code
is seen.
