Line:261, secondary/manager/restore.go -> What will happen in case an index in backup has 3 replicas but the current cluster has 2 nodes but only 1 replica? This check will skip repairing both the missing replicas while it is possible to restore one.

Line:296, secondary/manager/restore.go -> Isn't this a better place for to check and skip the replica restore?

Line:261, secondary/manager/restore.go -> I had thought about this use case earlier. I think the replica will get restored correctly.

In the example you have described, on line number 253, call to findNumReplica will return 1. In the first iteration of the loop (i.e. first missing replica in the image), "replicaToRestore" will be zero as we haven't yet identified any missing replica to restore. So, we will "allow" restore of first missing replica on line 261 as numReplica is 1 and len(m.current.Placement) is 2. Then we will add this replica to "replicaToRestore" (as per line number 298). In the next iteration (i.e. second missing replica in the image), numReplica on line 253 will become 2 (because findNumReplica will return 1 - as always - and len(replicaToRestore[index.DefnId]) will be 1). So, second replica restore will not be allowed. 

Note: Note that findNumReplica returns number of instances currently present in the cluster.

Line:296, secondary/manager/restore.go -> I have added the required check on line 261 because other checks to skip replica restore happen around there (for example the check at line 254). With my code changes, I am adding the safety check as early as possible in the code (with other checks).
