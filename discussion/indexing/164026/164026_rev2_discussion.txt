DESCRIPTION:

MB-49034 Eliminate use of ClusterInfoCache in genRebalanceToken()

This Rebalance StartTopologyChange() timeout failure was caused by
intermittent network flakiness as evidenced by various log messages from
different components during the timeout period. However, investigating
the code I found it possible to eliminate one of the two calls to
ClusterInfoCache.Fetch() from this codepath, which is what this patch
delivers. From the evidence in the log, each of these calls was taking
about 51 seconds in the run that timed out, for a total of ~102 seconds.
(The ns_server timeout for StartTopologyChange() is 60 seconds.)

StartTopologyChange() --> initStartPhase() had two children that called
ClusterInfoCache.Fetch(), which can take a long time especially if there
are any network glitches:
  1. genRebalanceToken()
  2. registerGlobalRebalanceToken()

This change eliminates the use of ClusterInfoCache from #1 as the only
thing it was getting from the cache was the local IP address, which we
can get much faster by stripping the final ":port" from the localhttp
field in RebalanceServiceManager.

For #2 we cannot eliminate the need for ClusterInfoCache.

Line:1359, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> Actually this may not work. The clusterAddr coming on the command line(which is used to compute localhttp) is in the form 127.0.0.1:xxxx. The actual IP needs to be taken from GetLocalHostname. Also, in the case of node rename, only the cluster info will have the latest information.

Line:1359, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> Ok, I didn't know there would be this problem. In my test it was coming as "127.0.0.1" from cinfo as well as from the localhttp field we already have.

Instead of doing it this way I will move ClusterInfo.Fetch() and related up into initStartPhase() itself rather than have two different children do it. The net will still be to eliminate one of them.

Line:1359, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> Third time's the charm -- I was right the first time. initStartPhase() is the only caller of registerGlobalRebalanceToken(). I was getting it confused with registerLocalRebalanceToken().

All is well -- updated fix coming soon.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1359, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> Oh, my second idea does not work either because there are several different callers of registerGlobalRebalanceToken(), not just initStartPhase(). I will need to investigate more.
