DESCRIPTION:

MB-49034 Eliminate use of ClusterInfoCache in genRebalanceToken()

This Rebalance StartTopologyChange() timeout failure was caused by
intermittent network flakiness as evidenced by various log messages from
different components during the timeout period. However, investigating
the code I found it possible to eliminate one of the two calls to
ClusterInfoCache.Fetch() from this codepath, which is what this patch
delivers. From the evidence in the log, each of these calls was taking
about 51 seconds in the run that timed out, for a total of ~102 seconds.
(The ns_server timeout for StartTopologyChange() is 60 seconds.)

StartTopologyChange() --> initStartPhase() had two children that called
ClusterInfoCache.Fetch(), which can take a long time especially if there
are any network glitches:
  1. genRebalanceToken()
  2. registerGlobalRebalanceToken()

This change eliminates the use of ClusterInfoCache from #1 as the only
thing it was getting from the cache was the local IP address, which we
can get much faster by stripping the final ":port" from the localhttp
field in RebalanceServiceManager.

For #2 we cannot eliminate the need for ClusterInfoCache.
