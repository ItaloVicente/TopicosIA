DESCRIPTION:

MB-50584: Add close channel to streaming endpoints in service notifier

* Service Notifier is listening to multiple streaming endpoints, on
  cleanup it will discard the singleton instance, close all active
  subscribers and create new one in the next call to contructor
* Instance cleanup currently is marking the notifier instance to be
  invalid and not actively terminating the currently running streaming
  connections. These stale connections, on an update, will check for the
  validity of the instance in the callback and return error if invalid.
  So here these old connections will get closed on the next update and
  will be active till the next notification on the streaming endpoint.
* Streaming endpoint for CollectionManifestNotifition will get closed
  on bucket delete and trigger an instance cleanup. This is needed for
  restarting the streaming connection in case of a genuine error.
* In case of this MB where there were continuous CRUD operations the
  NodeServicesStreaming endpoint was not getting an update and hence all
  the connections that were discarded as a part of instance cleanup on
  bucket deleted are not getting terminated.
* Also if we have 30 buckets we will have 30 streaming connections to
  ns_server on deletion of one bucket 1 connection will receive EOF and
  trigger the instance cleanup. 29 Bucket + 2 (poolStreaming
  nodeServicesStreaming) = 31 coonnections  will be discarded and a new
  instance will open new 31 coonections. These old 31 connections are
  waiting for an update on that endpoint to terminate from the callback
* To avoid keeping these stale connections waiting for the another
  update we are adding a closeCh which will get closed on the instance
  cleanup and the goroutines monitoring the streaming endpoints can stop
  monitoring and close the connection.
* runObserveStreamingEndpoint was reading buffer in synchronous manner
  so all the goroutines will be blocked on reading data upto a
  delimiter. Adding a child goroutine to read the data async to the cancel
  channel. When the cancel channel is closed the parent will close the
  body and later the child will return with error as the body is
  already closed.
