Line:735, secondary/collatejson/collate.go -> Q: Is it possible to remove this TODO from this patch?

Line:743, secondary/collatejson/collate.go -> Q: Is it possible to remove this TODO from this patch as you already have another patch for the same issue?

Line:28, secondary/indexer/restapi.go -> I had an earlier comment. Wouldn't 1024*1024 overflow in some cases? What happens when it overflows?

Line:419, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Q: Shouldn't we do *c.SetUsecjson(false)* in 'else' here as well (when err1 is not nil)? We were ignoring the error from c.Refresh() earlier.

Line:28, secondary/indexer/restapi.go -> This is just for initialisation. 

While actually using this buffer, we compare it with collatejson buffer size (multiplied by 6). If the cjson actual_key_size * 6 is larger than 1 MB, we  allocate a new buffer of size = actual_key_size * 6.

Right now, we are living with buffer size = actual_key_size * 3 in the various parts in the code. So, this should be good enough.

Line:419, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Thanks for the comment. I will fix this.

Line:970, secondary/collatejson/collate.go -> Please add brief comments on what this function does. Also, what care caller should take (like buffer sizes etc.) before calling this func.

Line:972, secondary/collatejson/collate.go -> Would this defer func() any performance degradation (if DecodeN1DLValues() is called in fastpath)?

Line:30, secondary/protobuf/query/query.go -> Please add comments on what the func does.

Line:1519, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Do we really need to panic?

Line:1216, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> Please add brief comments on what the func does.

Line:1345, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> Is there a problem if we call broker.SetResponseSender/CJson() before broker.SetResponseHandlerFactory(factory)

Line:1384, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> Should be defaultResponseHandlerCJson

Line:1394, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> Should be defaultResponseHandlerCJson

Line:1975, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> Do we really need to panic?

Line:1342, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> cjson path log messages should have *cjson* string explicitly so we know

Line:1387, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> These lines shouldn't be here, right?

Line:1529, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> log message should have string *cjson*
