DESCRIPTION:

MB-28926: Use collatejson as binary protocol between GSI client and indexer

Note that this change is an intermediate change. There are some
TODO's in the code that must be handled. Most of the functional
tests can be run for this. Code restructuring and cleanup is
yet to be done at a few places.

(3 comments)
Line:453, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Why is this a hack (I see you are forcing usecjson to true always)?

Line:41, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> Why 1MB? Can it not overflow? Same comment for other places where SECKEY_BUFSIZE is initialized as 1MB

Line:18, secondary/tests/framework/common/types.go -> It's probably more appropriate to call it CJson as the data format (instead of binary protocol) between GSI Client and Indexer as we aren't changing the protocol per se.
