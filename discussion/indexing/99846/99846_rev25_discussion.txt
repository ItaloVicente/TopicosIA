Line:18, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> The max size should be come from setting, rather than hardcoding.
We need to doucment this since this theroetically put a limit on the sec key size to be (64M/6 = 10.6M).  Currently, couchbase has a max doc size of 20M.

Line:101, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> Is there a reason to return an error instead of resizing Skeys?

Line:550, secondary/indexer/scan_pipeline.go -> you don't return the error?

Line:1524, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> You need to use atomic to Get and Set encoding format.   There are current goroutines to get/set this value

Line:58, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> using default Source may use mutex.  

func Intn(n int) int { return globalRand.Intn(n) }
var globalRand = New(&lockedSource{src: NewSource(1)})
type lockedSource struct {
    lk  sync.Mutex
    src Source
}

Line:1206, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> It can be expensive to get the pool for every single row.

Line:58, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> Deep has a good suggestion.  Instead of using Rand, use a channel to keep the set of sync.pool (just like a semaphore).    The caller get the sync.pool from the channel, and put the sync.pool back into the channel, once the caller is done allocating the buffer from the sync.pool.   If it runs out of sync.pool, the caller just allocate the buffer from heap directly, so nothing is blocked.

Line:1206, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> you should allocate one buffer for scan client before scattering -- just like how a separate queue is allocated for each scan client.

Line:58, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> Actually, there is an easy way to do it.  You just need an atomic integer.  The caller call AddUint64() to get the next value.   Then use mod to lookup the sync.pool.   Since the atomic variable is ever-increasing, each subsequent caller will basically use the next sync.pool in the array.   You have to handle overflow on the atomic integer (reset it back to 0).

Line:58, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> Thanks John. We actually discussed using atomic int increments with mod early on, but felt that may lead to contention during parallel increments, so went for rand. But today we discussed again and given the nature of requests from query it is unlikely that we will have any big contention. Amit is going to try this out tomorrow.
