Line:654, secondary/common/index.go -> Is it better to have DataEncodingFormat to be 0 (iota instead of iota + 1)?  This will make upgrade easier (gsiClient is pre-6.5 and indexer is in 6.5).   In this case,  scanRequest will have EncodingFormat of 0 value.   If DATA_ENC_JSON is 0, then indexer will just return result in old format.

Line:1, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> Ideally, this should be in queryport package.    But it is ok to put it here for now.

Line:36, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> Do we know how many times this method may get called for a single row?   If it is called more than once, it would be better to cache qValue after decoding.    Another option is to do decoding in ScanResultEntries.Append() itself, and just have ScanResultKey to keep a slice of qValue.

Line:95, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> Why do you need to keep s.Length instead of just using len(s.Skeys)?  s.Length is used in Append() but not in Get()

Line:131, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> Just to be safe.   We should use s.Ctr instead of using len(s.Skeys).  It is ok for now due to the way you use this API now.  But as a generic utility (in common package), it can lead to issue if this API is being differently in the future.

Line:149, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> What if kth exceed s.Length or c.Ctr?

Line:156, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> Should this method return c.Ctr instead?  Since c.Ctr indicates the number of valid keys in the buffer.

Line:160, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> What if kth exceeds len(s.Skeys) or c.Ctr?

Line:207, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> It is a bit dangerous to specify a limit on the buf size.  What if we have  a big key?  Every query that hits that key will fail?

Line:456, secondary/indexer/scan_pipeline.go -> Do you need to break the loop when there is error?

Line:379, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Why do we need to a copy of maxTempBufSize?   It should be coming from ClientSettings.

Line:406, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> If there is a refreshErr, DataEncodingFormat will not be initialized.

Line:601, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> You should use c.GetMaxTempBufSize() instead.  Since maxTempBufSize is a setting and customer may need to change it.

Line:659, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Use c.GetMaxTempBufSize()

Line:737, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Use c.GetMaxTempBufSize()

Line:792, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Use c.GetMaxTempBufSize()

Line:858, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Use c.GetMaxTempBufSize()

Line:920, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Use c.GetMaxTempBufSize()

Line:989, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Use c.GetMaxTempBufSize()

Line:1045, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Use c.GetMaxTempBufSize()

Line:1535, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> We may not need this function

Line:1539, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> we should get maxTempBufSize from ClientSettings

Line:1371, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> If there is an error, shouldn't you return false?

Line:1285, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> Won't it be better to declare skeys inside the for-loop, so each iteration will get a fresh skey?

Line:1353, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> Shouldn't we return on error?  Just for defensive coding.

Line:1492, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> return on error for defensive coding

Line:654, secondary/common/index.go -> Will fix it.

Line:1, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> I will keep it in common for now. I want to define ScanResultKey data type in common as original SecondaryKey is also defined in common.

Line:36, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> This gets called only once. In case of non-partitioned index, it will be called in function sendEntry (in secondary_index.go). Here the value passed to sendEntry will be nil. In case of partitioned index (sorted=true), this function gets called from requestBroker::SendEntries (Getkth). Once this value is got, that value is passed to the sendEntry, and there, decode will not be called as value is already present. 

Not converting to n1ql value in Append allows us to optimise backfill "in future" as collatejson is already a serialised format and hence gob encoding can be avoided. 

Please let me know if you think otherwise.

Line:95, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> Will remove s.Length, will use s.Ctr and len(s.Skeys) instead.

Line:131, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> Will fix it.

Line:149, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> Will fix it.

Line:156, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> Will fix it.

Line:160, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> Will fix it.

Line:207, secondary/common/scan_result.go -> As discussed in scrum, I will remove the maxTempBufSize and retry logic.

Line:456, secondary/indexer/scan_pipeline.go -> Will fix it.

Line:379, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Will remove maxTempBufSize as it is not needed.

Line:406, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Will fix it.

Line:601, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Will remove maxTempBufSize altogether.

Line:659, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Will remove maxTempBufSize altogether.

Line:737, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Will remove maxTempBufSize altogether.
