Thanks deep for the comment. I have done my own analysis to verify why there is no need to check for MAINT_STREAM in idx.streamBucketRequestStopCh. Details below:

Build Index can also race with (places in code where idx.streamBucketRequestStopCh is set):

- Another build index
- - This is covered by index state checks in check duplicate initial build request

- Stop Bucket Stream: Gets called from
- - handlePrepareRecovery : Specific checks are present for indexer in recovery mode. 
- - handleRecoveryDone (when no index found) : Specific checks are present for indexer in recovery mode. 
- - handleBucketNotFound: bucket exists check in build index code path.

- startBucketStream: Gets called from
- handleInitRecovery : Specific checks are present for indexer in recovery mode.
- handleKVStreamRepair : If KV requests a stream to be repaired, it means that at least one index already exists. In this case, new index build will go to init stream. Hence no problem after the fix.
- NewIndexer : This race can’t happen as, until NewIndexer succeeds, indexer does not start listening to any other requests.

There are no more knows race conditions.

sounds good Amit. One minor comment.
Line:3755, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> checkStreamRequestPending already logs idx.streamBucketRequestStopCh if stopCh != nil. It may not be required here.
