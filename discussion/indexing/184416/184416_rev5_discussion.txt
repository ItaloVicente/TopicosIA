DESCRIPTION:

MB-52409 avoid ServiceChangeNotifier teardown

bg: in serverless env, we can expect many bucket addition deletion
events. also we could run into networ errors and streams end.
on such events currently we teardown the entire pool watcher

exp: do not terminate SCN upon bucket deletetion.

assumption (verified): Upon bucket deletetion, we still receive a pool change
notification and hence watchers adjust to that
