DESCRIPTION:

MB-49400 (7.1.0 1601) Autofailover: Improve logging

Improve Autofailover logging in two ways:

1. AutofailoverServiceManager.HealthCheck(): Do not log every call and
   return of this method. This is called every two seconds by ns_server
   and logging them all causes log flooding. Instead log only at return
   time and only if the function took longer than 1 second from call to
   final log statement before return.

2. CpuThrottle.SetCpuTarget(): Log the new setting iff the setting
   changed. (This gets called every time any config is updated, so do
   not log every call – only if it results in changing the current
   setting.) Also error log the rejection of invalid settings.
