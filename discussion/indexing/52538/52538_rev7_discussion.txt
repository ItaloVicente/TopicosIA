DESCRIPTION:

MB-15449 index: Remove inmemory snapshot creation for non-main trees

Currently index snapshots are only used for index scans. For index
scans, we are only interested in main index tree. It is useless
to create backindex and meta inmemory snapshots. This change
could potentially improve index insertion throughput as well as
reduction in memory overhead caused by indexer.
