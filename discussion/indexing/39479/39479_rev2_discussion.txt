DESCRIPTION:

CBIDXT-114: projector control path delay.

I have shuffled the sequence of StreamRequest and Failoverlog request to make
sure that control path is not getting switched out 1024 times due to network
calls, after posting 1024 StreamRequests.

we can't rely on this if the logic of failover-timestamp and kv-timestamp
computation changes in the future.
