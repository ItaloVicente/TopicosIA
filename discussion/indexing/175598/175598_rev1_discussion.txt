DESCRIPTION:

Avoid using cluster info client in planner

Instead, do an adhoc fetch every time planner is invoked.
This will make sure that the indexer list does not change
after reading the list of indexers. Also, the cost of the
pools/default and pools/default/nodeServices endpoint is
vary cheap (<1ms) in most cases. So, this will not have
a lot of perf impact during DDL operations.

The other alternative to adhoc fetch is to use cinfoLite
module - but that would mean query client has to process
a lot of PoolChangeNotifications even if they are not
relevant to planner
