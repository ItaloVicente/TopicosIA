DESCRIPTION:

Call newly added forestdb destroy api on Drop Index

When an index is dropped, the physical files need to be
cleaned up as well. ForestDB now has a destroy api to do that.
That api needs to be called for all slices of an index.

There is a corresponding goforestdb commit, which needs to be
merged along with this.

Line:493, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> Are we going to handle slice refcounting and lazy delete of slices later ?
