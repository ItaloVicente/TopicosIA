DESCRIPTION:

MB-45380 restrict waitForIndexBuild to work on a single batch tokens

waitForIndexBuild gets spawned for each rebalance batch. As it iterates
over the whole list of accepted tokens, it is possible that if state
changes are very quick, waitForIndexBuild for a previous batch can
pickup the next batch's tokens prematurely. This can lead to unexpected
state changes. Restrict each waitForIndexBuild to monitor its own batch.
