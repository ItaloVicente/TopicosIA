MB-37589: Build indexes scheduled for creation asynchronously

schedIndexCreator is responsible only for creating index metadata.
The index build will be triggered by the DDL service manager for
the non-deferred indexes.

Line:321, secondary/indexer/sched_index_creator.go -> Is this TODO not relevant (or) am I missing the code for refresh on rebalance?

Line:204, secondary/indexer/sched_index_creator.go -> Minor: Just curious, why a function here

Line:887, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> Should we make this configurable (or) always have asyncCreate set to true?

Line:321, secondary/indexer/sched_index_creator.go -> There are other TODO's. 

Also, startProcessDDL now resets m.provider, so there is no need to do anything here. 

Complete integration with rebalance code is not yet done.

Line:204, secondary/indexer/sched_index_creator.go -> Kept code similar to startProcessDDL. No specific reason.

Line:887, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> This function CreateIndexWithDefnAndPlan is expected to be called from scheduled index creation code. Any other caller needs to understand what this function does before using this function.

Having said that, making this parameter configurable for scheduled index creation is a bad idea - as triggering the index build via scheduled index creation has a lot of coding overheads (scheduled index creator will need to implement logic from this for loop: https://github.com/couchbase/indexing/blob/master/secondary/indexer/ddl_service_manager.go#L656). So, we have decided to delegate the responsibility to DDL service manager.
