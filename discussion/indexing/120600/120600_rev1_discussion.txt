DESCRIPTION:

MB-31944 New infra for rollback to zero

Any index receiving a rollback to zero will again go through
the cycle similar to index creation/build within indexer server.
This change is aimed at supporting the collection flush with a
stateless approach.

This also helps in regular cases where after a rollback to 0, index
scans would return no results. Now after a rollback to 0, index state
will be change to Create/Initial and all scans will return a proper
error message.
