DESCRIPTION:

MB-52382 (7.1.2 3365) tt to acceptedTokens before metakv state change

This reorders case TransferTokenCreated: in processTokenAsDest() to add
the transfer token to the acceptedTokens[] map before advancing the TT's
state in metakv. This ensures the TT is in the map before the next
metakv callback on it, so it can be checked by
checkAllAcceptedIndexesReadyToBuildLOCKED(), thus avoiding a possible
race where its build never starts because it was not there when the
check was done (different race from the current bug). It also moves TT
entry to the map before the disk IO of metakv state change, which may
help narrow the race window of the current bug since TT state processing
is going on concurrently for all TTs, i.e. it may help get all the TTs
into the map before any of them advance to the next state, which is what
we want to avoid hitting the current bug's race condition. (This will
not 100% eliminate the current bug's race though. That requires bigger
changes.)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> metakv callback is serialized i.e. metakv will only call the next processTokens once the previous one has returned. There cannot be two concurrent goroutines for processTokens. So changing this order is not going to make a difference.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Ah, ok. Then nothing to do for 7.1.2.
