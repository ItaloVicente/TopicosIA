DESCRIPTION:

MB-45329 fix snapshot leak in scan coordinator

when an index gets deleted, updateLastSnapshotMap deletes
the index entry from lastSnapMap.

1. updateLastSnapshotMap will
a. clone lastSnapMap
b. acquire snap container mutex
c. free the current snapshot
d. delete the entry from local copy of lastSnapMap
e. release snap container mutex
f. do atomic Set of the new lastSnapMap

2. Concurrently listenSnapshot could to atomic read of the lastSnapMap
after 1a but before 1f.

3. If there is a pending snapshot notification from storage manager, it
can acquire the mutex after 1e. It will find there is a valid index
entry and snapshot container. It will add the snapshot to snapshot container.
This snapshot will never get destroyed as after 1f, the lastSnapMap is
not supposed to contain any snapshot for the index.
