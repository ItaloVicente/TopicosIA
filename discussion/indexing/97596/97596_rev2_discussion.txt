actively waiting for response from memcached.

Patch Set 2:

In all the places, if an error occurs the code will return without resetting the timeout.

In early 2015, We did (I think Sarath did) some benchmark on how socket r/w scale with timeouts, we found some performance penalty. I wish we created an isolated scenario to demonstrate that, since golang versions improve over time it would have become handy to do measurements across different versions. Just an FYI.
Line:254, secondary/dcp/conn_pool.go -> Do we need timeout for only read or for both read and write ? Note that there is an equivalent SetWriteDeadline().

Line:263, secondary/dcp/conn_pool.go -> Is this future proof, I thought having this under defer() would be future proof.

Line:278, secondary/dcp/conn_pool.go -> Same as above.

Line:67, secondary/dcp/transport/client/mc.go -> This is the lowest function that does send/receive. If not here, we will need to add the timeout in many callers of this functions.
