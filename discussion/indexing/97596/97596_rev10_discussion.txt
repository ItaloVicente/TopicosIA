DESCRIPTION:

MB-30700: Introduce timeout in all indexing to memcached communication paths

Timeout is needed in only those code paths where projector/indexer is
actively waiting for response from memcached. The timeout is set before
making the request and the timeout is reset (i.e. no timeout) after the
response is received.

Line:76, secondary/dcp/transport/client/mc.go -> Q: Why is this Debugf() where as in ResetMcdConnectionDeadline(0 it's an Errorf()?

Line:76, secondary/dcp/transport/client/mc.go -> Error in setting Deadline has no impact on product workflows (except for actual timeouts will not happen). On the other hand, error in resetting the deadline can cause errors in further product workflows. So, Errorf will be useful in in ResetMcdConnectionDeadline to debug possible issues.
