DESCRIPTION:

MB-31935: Introduce consumer based stat filter in /stats REST endpoint

Various consumers of /stats, like planner, rebalancer can now request
consumer specific stats. This will avoid a large sized payload from
the response.

Indexer's stats_manager will know which stats are needed by which
consumer.
