DESCRIPTION:

MB-34157: Prune additional key positions in partitioned index with ORDER BY

Save the additional projections added by OrderBy processing in RequestBroker.
At the time of gather() (as part of scatter gather for partitioned order-by
processing), when sorted entry is being sent to N1QL, prune the "additional"
projection positions added due to Order-By requirements.

Also, if original index projection is nil, do proceed with analyzeOrderBy
nil projection implies everything need to be projected.

Line:418, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> As we can pre determine size of newVals, can we avoid append here ? Will it be useful ?

Line:418, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> I think we can predetermine. 
len(newVals) = len(vals) - len(indexOrderPosPruneMap)

Another approach is: Instead of picking what we want, we can remove from vals slice what we dont want. But this will lead to multiple re-slicing of vals. Hence I went with the other approach.

Line:413, secondary/queryport/client/scatter.go -> As we are only going to prune items from val, it would be good to explore if golang is going to optimize it and do it without reallocation if we re-slice. That can remove the need for newVals altogether. Worse case we should be able to do it ourself.
