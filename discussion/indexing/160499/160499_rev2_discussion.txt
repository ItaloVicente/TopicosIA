DESCRIPTION:

MB-46510: Sequential index creation is failing with "Build Already In Progress"

RCA: Index creation with deferred = false should be a synchronus call but when we create index with one or more replicas,
create index returns as soon as one of the replica is in active state even when other replicas have not finished building yet.
Fix: recoverable create index will now wait for all replicas to finish building before returning from create index call.
This will ensure all deferred = false DDLs are synchronus, even in case of background index creation, query will continue
to wait till the build is finished.
