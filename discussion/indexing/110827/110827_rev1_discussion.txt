DESCRIPTION:

MB-33849 Separate projector book-keeping update in kvdata

When projector receives a MTR from an indexer for the second time,
projector would trigger kvdata.updateTs() method. This method will only
update the book-keeping and return back to the caller. In cases where
downstream becomes slow, kvdata.updateTs() could take more time to respond
as both data and control messages are handled by same thread.

In this commit, the control and data paths are separated into two different
threads so that control path latency becomes independent of data path and
hence response to updateTs can be made faster
