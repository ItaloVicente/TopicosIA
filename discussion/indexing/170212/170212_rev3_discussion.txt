DESCRIPTION:

MB-50770 (7.1.0 2179) Remove unneeded RetryHelper from FetchForBucket()

cluster_info.go FetchForBucket() is only called by metadata_provider.go
checkValidKeyspace(), a private function inside waitForScheduledIndex().
This does had a 300x RetryHelper inside FetchForBucket(), but the caller
has its own retry loop that terminates as soon as an ending condition is
detected. One expected ending condition is that the bucket, scope, or
collection has been dropped, so this should not retry hundreds of times.
Doing so floods query.log with retry messages from children.

The fix is to change the RetryHelper from 300 to 5 retries, as well as
to change the children (and related functions while we're at it) that
have their own internal loops that do 5 retries to only log one message
for all retries instead of one per retry. Also removed unused features
of FetchForBucket().

Line:240, secondary/common/cluster_info.go -> This looks fine for the current use case Kevin. But the intention behind adding this function was to have a generic API which allows user to select data that gets fetched for the API he is going to use on that cinfo object.

cinfo already has the below fields in the struct definition.
	retries       uint32
	retryInterval time.Duration
	retryFactor   int

Adding maxRetries here from the arguments might confuse user if cinfo.retries will be honoured or not. I feel we can stick to this standard convention of cinfo setting the maxRetries from SetMaxRetries function and have the retry handler as earlier. Few functions using from the object and few using from the params i think is not a good state to be in.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:240, secondary/common/cluster_info.go -> Thanks, I have switched it to use cinfo.retries now and put back the unused features of FetchForBucket(). I also consolidated the two nodeSvcs blocks in that function and removed its local logging of validateCache() outcome as that function already logs for failures and reordered the input arguments to match the order of the code in the body.
