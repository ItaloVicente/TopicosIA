DESCRIPTION:

MB-32162: Add key size stats with snapshot persistence

- Add key_size_distribution stats which is bucketized
  stats for index key sizes
- Add arrkey_size_distribution for entire array key
  for plasma array indexes
- Introduce persistence of additional info along with
  MOI and plasma persisted snapshots handling
  snapshot meta disk format upgrade
- Add key size stats to snapshot meta
- Upgraded indexes from older version will not have
  key sizes returned in stats API unless there is a
  rollback to zero

Line:1781, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> This should be renamed to *subArrayKeySizeStat* (as in substract)

Line:1183, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Q: Is there a remote possibility of these 8 bytes being 0 for old format as well? If yes, what will happen?

Line:188, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> 1K+1

Line:189, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> 4K+1

(1) Q: Do you want to add functional tests for this? 

(2) Q: Do we need the key size distribution for primary index?
Line:80, secondary/indexer/constant.go -> Minor comment: smaller names may reduce disk I/O by some small amount.

Line:882, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Q: What is expected behaviour in case of err != nil ?

@Amit:
(1) Q: Do you want to add functional tests for this? 
Yes, I plan to do automated tests for this
(2) Q: Do we need the key size distribution for primary index?
Since max size of primary key is only 250 bytes, I dont think key size distribution is of value for primary index
Line:80, secondary/indexer/constant.go -> Done

Line:882, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> It is the same as before. In case of error, infos will be empty. Will cause reset store rebuilding from start as MOI could not find a snapshot info to recover from

Line:1781, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Makes sense. Its not removal stat. Mainly subtraction. I will call subtract as sub can mean sub array especially in subArrayKeySizeStat :)

Line:1183, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> As of existing code, there is no possibility of first 8 bytes being 0 in old format. But, as discussed, I am making format upgrade simpler and similar to MOI. First 8 bytes continue to be unix time now.

Line:188, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> Done

Line:189, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> Done
