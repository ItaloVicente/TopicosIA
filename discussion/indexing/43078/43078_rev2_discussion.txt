DESCRIPTION:

CBIDXT-188 Implement infrastructure for consistent scanning

Implemented a mechanism in the scan coordinator to perform
query on consistent snapshots. Every query request can provide an
atleast-timestamp or nil. The scanner will ask storage manager
to provide a consistent snapshot timestamp that can fullfil
the query's atleast timestamp. The scanner will block wait until
a snapshot is available that can meet the query's atleast criteria.
Once snapshot timestamp is available, the scanner will use that
timestamp to scan slices.

Patch Set 2: Code-Review+1

Giving +1, but consistent scanning is a requirement from N1QL that is not fully resolved. We will have to revisit this.

Patch Set 2:

this is just basic infrastructure required from scanner. We need to do more work to make use of this from N1QL.
Requires some work in N1QL and Scan, ScanAll APIs to make use of consistent scanning.
