Some minor comments.   Indexer.go looks big -- may be due for a refactor.
Line:138, secondary/indexer/cbq_bridge.go -> This user request will be blocked until the build is done.    If the http request timeout, will it be possible for the admin to tell if the index build is still on-going?  We don't have to fix this in this commit, but it is good to add a JIRA task to make sure we handle it properly.

Line:393, secondary/indexer/flusher.go -> Why we are removing the check if we can find the uuid is in the index inst map?  Trying to avoid race condition when delete index (index inst is gone while mutation still in mutation queue?)

Line:138, secondary/indexer/cbq_bridge.go -> Sure. Will create JIRA task for this.

Line:393, secondary/indexer/flusher.go -> The check has been moved to the function calling this one - flush().
