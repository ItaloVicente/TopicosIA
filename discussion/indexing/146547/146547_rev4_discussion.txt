Requesting snapshots on storage manager command channel does
not scale well with increase in scan concurrency. Hence, using
a worker pool to listen and proceess snapshot requests
simultaneously

Hey Amit, We can safely skip the main-loop as the updation of indexSnapMap and waitersMap is made atomic. However, the updates to snapMap and waitersMap are serialised through the corresponding fine grained lock that exists with the snapshot/waiter container.

So, if an index is getting dropped, then StorageMgr::handleUpdateIndexInstMap would acquire the fine grained lock, delete the corresponding entries (i.e. either snapshot or waiter list from those maps). This would serialise the updates. Hence, I don’t see a race condition here that could lead to an inconsistent state.
