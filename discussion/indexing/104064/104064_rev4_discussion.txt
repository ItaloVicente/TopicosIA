Line:33, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> This should be protected using atomic operation

Line:40, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> This should be protected by atomic oepration.

Line:55, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> Would 0-size be faster than multiplication (-1 * size)?

Line:69, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> Need to be protected by atomic operation.

Line:73, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> Need to be protected by atomic operation

Line:82, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> When the channel is closed, you need to wake up the waiting goroutine to exit.

Line:99, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> This needs to be protected by atomic operation.  use integer instead of boolean for memBoundCh.closed
