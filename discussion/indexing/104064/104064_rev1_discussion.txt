Line:11, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> We should rephrase to *max allowed channel size or max size of all items on the channel*

Line:12, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> *max allowed channel size *

Line:17, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> There does not seem to be much use of storing this at the moment

Line:22, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> Please run gofmt

Line:54, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> This 'for' loop is probably not needed. There is no continue anywhere below

Line:72, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> Perhaps Push() should take *size of the element* as the second argument

Line:90, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> Q: Why do we need this?

Line:72, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> Done

Line:90, secondary/common/memBoundCh.go -> Golang condition variable unlocks the mutex, sleeps, wakes up on a signal and locks the mutex again. If the mutex is not locked before unlocking, golang would throw panic. Hence, this lock is introduced
