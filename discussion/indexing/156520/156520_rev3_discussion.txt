DESCRIPTION:

MB-46728 Generate disk snapshot only if all stream begins are received

When a partition is being moved during rebalance, it is possible
that timekeeper has generated a disk snapshot for source partition
although it has not received all stream begin messages. This can
happen if some vbuckets have no data.

In such a case, if partition merge is attempted, indexer can panic
as the source instance does not have enough stream begins like
target partition. To avoid this, timekeeper would now wait for
all stream begin messages to arrive before generating a disk snapshot.
