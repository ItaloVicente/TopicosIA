DESCRIPTION:

MB-44764 Implement worker pool management at storageMgr

The current implementation of throttling snapshot go-routines is
not performance efficient as multiple go-routines are contending
on a single lock. To avoid this contention, storage manager
spawns snapshot workers for each stream keyspaceID (currently,
only for MAINT_STREAM).

This worker pool should avoid contention on the lock and also help
optimise the snapshot creation time by reducing the overhead on
runtime. This is a first patch in the series of changes for
implementing an efficient worker pool.

> This is going to be a tricky change due to the current storage manager design. e.g. if storage manager is processing a rollback on an unrelated stream/keyspace, it is not going to be able to process any stream management message from indexer. Indexer main loop will need to wait. Currently, the stream open/remove messages go to the components which can process it quickly(for kvsender, it is done async). This can surface up latent race conditions in stream management.

Hey Deep, I changed the implementation to manage the worker pool when there is an update to indexInstMap.

a. When a MAINT_STREAM starts for a keyspace for the first time, worker pool will be started
b. When all indexes in MAINT_STREAM are removed for a keyspace, then the worker pool will be closed
