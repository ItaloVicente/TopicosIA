DESCRIPTION:

MB-44764 Implement stream open and remove stream messages at storageMgr

The current implementation of throttling snapshot go-routines is
not performance efficient as multiple go-routines are contending
on a single lock. To avoid this contention, storage manager
spawns snapshot workers for each stream keyspaceID (currently,
only for MAINT_STREAM).

This worker pool should avoid contention on the lock and also help
optimise the snapshot creation time by reducing the overhead on
runtime. This is a first patch in the series of changes for
implementing an efficient worker pool.

In this patch, storage manager starts to processes the OPEN_STREAM
and REMOVE_KEYSPACE_FROM_STREAM messages so that it can spawn or
shutdown snapshot workers accordingly
