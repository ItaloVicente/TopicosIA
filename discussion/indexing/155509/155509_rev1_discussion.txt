DESCRIPTION:

MB-39263: Move iterateChildren/RunObserveChildren to v2 api metakv

As part of a multi-stage process to move both of these api's to the V2
version, we are first changing all of these api's to the v2 version,
at which point we will duplicate it, without the v2 label, and then
eventually drop the v2 label in all services and finally remove the
duplicate in metakv.

We are migrating this API and because it's used in many repos we have to do it in multiple parts. This is the first part. Please check my work -- I am not familiar with this codebase, and I just mechanically changed things. Thanks!
