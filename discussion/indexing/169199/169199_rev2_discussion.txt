DESCRIPTION:

MB-50322: Enable dataport auth

If there is a delay in observing cluster version uprade on
projector side, the projector will not send auth packet. The
indexer dataport server will reject the connection due to
missing authentication. This will lead to indexer triggering
the stream recovery due to missing stream begin messages.
As stream recovery code path is disruptive, it is good to
avoid that. So, indexer will send needsAuth flag while making
stream requests so that projector endpoint can force auth for
that indexer even if cluster is not fully upgraded.

Line:315, secondary/dataport/endpoint.go -> Is the cluster version check required? An upgraded projector can always send auth packet to an upgraded indexer(based on needsAuth) flag?
