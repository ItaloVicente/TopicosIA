DESCRIPTION:

MB-50322: Enable dataport auth

If there is a delay in observing cluster version uprade on
projector side, the indexer dataport server will reject the
connection due to missing authentication. This will lead to
indexer triggering the stream recovery due to missing stream
begin messages. As stream recovery code path is disruptive,
it is good to avoid that. So, indexer will send needsAuth flag
while making stream requests so that projector endpoint can
force auth for that indexer even if cluster is not fully
upgraded.
