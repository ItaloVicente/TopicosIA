Line:2554, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> If const "method" defined above is not being used, please remove it, though it would be better to use it instead of each log message repeating the prefix part.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2554, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Hi Yogendra, using const "method" is counter productive for debugging (at least for me) as we loose the ability to grep the code and find the related log line. 

With method name in the log message it self, we can directly grep for the method name and pick the required line from output. Otherwise, we need to grep with a suitable regex and if there is more than one match, we need to check the method name in which the line is - I believe this is a more time taking approach.

I don't see strong reasons as to why we use "method" names. Hence, removed it
