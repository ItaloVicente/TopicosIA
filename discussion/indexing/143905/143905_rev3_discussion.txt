Yes. We can observe this in cluster_run as well. Take processCreate for example. We pass list of indexer nodes and hosts as nil. After the if condition at line 1717, node will contain the list of all indexer nodes retrieved from cluster info cache. At line 1744, as len(indexers) is not zero, we will add these nodes again. So, it becomes possible to add to "nids" slice twice

If it is expected to have either indexers as nil or hosts as nil, then the initial implementation and my previous patch are also wrong. Updated the patch.
