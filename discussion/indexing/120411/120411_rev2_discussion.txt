DESCRIPTION:

MB-31959 Update kvdata references to become keyspace aware in feed.go

With collections, the projector book-keeping is made at keyspace level
and not at bucket level. The Keyspace name is chosen by indexer. This
patch updates all the kvdata references to refer with keyspace name rather
than with bucket name. It also assumes that the keyspace name is same as
bucket name (until the request from indexer is updated to contain keyspace name)
