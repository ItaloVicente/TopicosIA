Line:664, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> array index delete needs to be handled as well?

Line:603, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> I think dataSize should include data for main+back store. Otherwise, dataSize won't reflect the actual data usage.

Line:725, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> we should use entry instead of entrySz. docId needs to be part of data size calculation.

Line:892, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> use entry instead of entrySz. please check all the places.

Line:603, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Hi Deep, we discussed this at length. The plan is to add another dataSizeBack stat to track it's size separately for both MOI & Plasma. When we have it, we can decide in UI can show main+back or just main. The reason is to track what the user thinks/knows he inserted in dataSize and overhead in dataSizebBack. Thoughts?

Line:664, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Hi Deep, Sorry. My bad. I missed the array deletes. Thanks for pointing this.

Line:725, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Hi Deep, 

entrySz is the length entry (line 722). "entry" contains docid as a part of it. Am I missing anything?

Line:892, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Hi Deep, 

entrySz is the length entry (line 887). "entry" contains docid as a part of it. Am I missing anything?

Line:603, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> My worry is the users are going to complain about the big difference between data size and memory used stats on the UI. From a user's perspective, it is a lot of overhead. Right now, we show data size as back+main index. Let's discuss this in scrum.

Line:725, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> ignore my comment. I misread the code.

Line:892, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> ignore my comment. I misread the code.
