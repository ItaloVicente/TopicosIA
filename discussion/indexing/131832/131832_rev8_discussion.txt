Line:168, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> I didn't get the reason for using b.indexList. currmeta is local to Refresh. Are there any modifiers which can change b.indexers.allIndexes without changing b.indexers? The original MH code used to return currmeta.allIndexes(without atomic load), so I assume there shouldn't be any.

Line:168, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> Q: Why do we need b.indexList?
A: Without scheduled create indexes, currmeta.allIndexes as the final list of indexes. But now, due to scheduled create indexes, the final list will be union of currmet.allIndexes and list of schedule create indexes. If there was a metadata change (either due to new schedule create tokens or due to indexTopology update), we need to re-calculate the final list of indexes. So, final list of indexes needs to be stored somewhere so that we don't need to recalculate it every time refresh() is called. There are two possibilities. (1) store final index list in a separate variable - which I am doing in this patch. That variable is b.indexList (2) append list of scheduled token indexes to currmeta.allIndexes - which I feel is not a good design - as the currmeta (b.indexers) becomes inconsistent.

Q: Are there any modifiers which can change b.indexers.allIndexes without changing b.indexers
A: No. As per my understanding, all updates to b.indexers happen safely using safeupdate function.

I agree that original MH code doesn't require atomic load for allIndexes (after currmeta is loaded atomically). I can avoid atomic load at line 181 here. Even better, I can avoid all 3 atomic loads on lines 179, 180 and 181. I am not completely sure but, is this what you were suggesting?

Line:168, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> sounds good. this code should be fine.
