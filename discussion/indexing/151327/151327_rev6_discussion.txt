DESCRIPTION:

MB-45666 Fix boot race of getClientStats and updateIndexStats2NoLock

Client bootstrap calls getClientStats() once to get a complete
IndexStats2 object to initialize local cache with. Meanwhile the
normal event-handling loop is started, which receives and processes
incoming IndexStats2 objects from periodic Lifecycle broadcasts in
updateIndexStats2NoLock(). This results in a race where a the former
could overwrite the cache with an older version than the latter has
already cached, causing later nil pointer deref to cached entry if a
bucket was added in the newer version it overwrote that the older
version does not have an entry for.

The fix is to change getClientStats() to do compare-and-swap and only
put its entry into the cache if the cache is still nil. I also removed
some cache validation code that was not needed, because either the
cache (w.clientStats) is nil (only until initialized), or it contains
a complete IndexStats2 object, as we never cache incomplete objects,
so if the cache pointer is non-nil we do not have to run through it
to see if it is complete or not.

I also made a couple performance improvements:
1. Eliminated the unnecessary cloning of the indexStats2 when it
   gets cached.
2. 14 cases: skip converting byte slices to strings for Debug log
   messags if they won't be logged.

Finally, I changed the Indexer broadcast to send a complete object
every 5 minutes in case the original response to getClientStats() got
lost or corrupted. Otherwise the client would have no list of indexes
indefinitely (until either an index or a bucket was created or
dropped).

Varun -- I have made the updates to address your review as we discussed last week. Also a couple performance improvements (eliminate cloning; defn.go don't convert marshaled byte slices to strings for Debug log messages if they will not be logged).

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:235, secondary/manager/client/defn.go -> I put it back commented out. There is a cost to having it there as it will generate grep hits and sometimes time spent maintaining unused code, or else letting it slide out of alignment, and it seems unlikely it will ever be used.
