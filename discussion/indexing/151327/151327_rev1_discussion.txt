DESCRIPTION:

MB-45666 Fix nil pointer cases in updateIndexStats2NoLock()

Fix nil pointer dereference panic in this function. It appears the
nil item was clientStats.Stats[bucket], meaning the client's cached
version of the stats was missing a bucket that the just-received but
still incomplete version (indexStats2) had an entry for. This is an
edge case where the cache is stale, so we need to check for it and
return nil and not update the cache if it occurs (instead of
panicking 8^D). There were some other dereferences I could not 100%
convince myself could never be nil so I added checks for those too.
