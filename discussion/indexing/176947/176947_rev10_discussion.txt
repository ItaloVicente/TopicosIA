Line:314, secondary/indexer/request_handler.go -> Why not add these http handlers to the master_service_manager.go itself? What is the benefit of passing *MasterServiceManager here?

Line:314, secondary/indexer/request_handler.go -> I was trying to keep the division of responsibilities as:

request_handler.go -- Dispatcher of REST API calls that is the single place that deals with HTTP-related things (requests, responses, authentication, URL parameters, marshaling and unmarshaling JSON payloads). These are HTTP implementation details unrelated to the business logic, and it would be nice to keep it out of other classes as it is basically distraction and clutter. This approach also makes it easy to find all the REST handlers as they are all registered in request_handler.go instead of scattered around different files. I.e. the "request handler" class should handle all the requests.

xxx_service_manager.go -- Implementation of business logic. Should not need to know anything about HTTP as that is just an implementation detail of REST as the physical communication mechanism.

I know there are already several other files that register REST endpoints ... and this has already resulted in us having at least two separate but similar implementations of most HTTP overhead methods (request_handler has one set and Indexer has another set) -- that's the kind of thing that tends to happen when there is not a single central dispatcher class. Another thing that tends to happen when this separation is not maintained (and has happened in much of our code) is that the handler implementations tend to end up mixing HTTP overhead tasks with business logic tasks, resulting in it becoming impossible to call the business logic implementations directly -- you are forced to do loopback REST because there is no non-REST handler delegate. I was trying to avoid those kinds of messes by separating HTTP from business logic this way.

It's up to you -- I can refactor to move the REST endpoints to other classes, in that case
o GenericServerManager would get /test/GetTaskList and /test/CancelTask
o PauseManager would get /test/Pause and /test/Resume

MasterServerManager is just a wrapper class that should not have any logic at all other than making the delegation to child classes visible in the code instead of invisible through composition.

Line:314, secondary/indexer/request_handler.go -> The downside I see of trying to keep all the REST handlers here is that it would need to import all the relevant packages (e.g. the cbauth.service package) and create data structures e.g. GetTaskListResponse or functions like revStringToServiceRevision. It may be okay for these lightweight functions but it can get more complex quickly.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:314, secondary/indexer/request_handler.go -> You are right -- it is way less messy to move the REST registration and handlers out to their respective implementing classes. I have done this in patchset 11.
