DESCRIPTION:

MB-33849 Split control and data processing to different go-routines in kvdata

The control and data processing is split into two go-routines with this patch.
genServer() handles the control path and runScatter() handles the datapath.
Between the two go-routines only reqTs is shared. runScatter() uses reqTs to
update Seqno incase of stream begin messages. As stream begins are not that
often, reqTs is protected with reqTs mutex

As there are two separate go-routines, there is no ordering in the way the routines
can terminate. To make sure both the go-routines exit gracefully, the following
channels have been introduced:

a. genServerFinCh - Controls the execution of genServer() routine. genServer()
will exit when this channel is closed

b. runScatterFinCh - Controls the execution of runScatter() routine. runScatter()
will exit when this channel is closed

c. genServerStopCh - This channel is used to block all incoming requests reaching
KVdata. Incoming requests will error out with ErrorClosed when this channel is closed

The semantics followed are:

a. When runScatter() exits, then close genServerFinCh so that genServer()
terminates (In case runScatter() exists first, closing genServerFinCh ensures
that genServer() will eventually exit)

b. If genServer() exits, then
    1. Close genServerStopCh to block all incoming requests to this kvdata instance
    2. Close runScatterFinCh so that runScatter() terminates and data processing
       is stopped for this kvdata instance
    3. Publish StreamEnd to feed to clear book-keeping and close all workers
