DESCRIPTION:

MB-33849 Split control and data processing to different go-routines in kvdata

The control and data processing is split into two go-routines with
this patch. genServer() handles the control path and runScatter()
handles the datapath. Between the two go-routines only reqTs is
shared. runScatter() uses reqTs to update Seqno incase of stream
begin messages. As stream begins are not that often, reqTs is
protected with reqTs mutex

As there are two separate go-routines, there is no ordering in the
way the routines can terminate. To make sure both the go-routines
exit gracefully, the following channels have been introduced:

a. genServerFinCh - Controls the execution of genServer() routine.
genServer() will exit when this channel is closed

b. runScatterFinCh - Controls the execution of runScatter() routine.
runScatter() will exit when this channel is closed

c. genServerStopCh - This channel is used to block all incoming
requests reaching KVdata. Incoming requests will error out with
ErrorClosed when this channel is closed

The semantics followed are:

a. When runScatter() exits, then close genServerFinCh so that
genServer() terminates (In case runScatter() exists first, closing
genServerFinCh ensures that genServer() will eventually exit)

b. If genServer() exits, then
    1. Close genServerStopCh to block all incoming requests to
       this kvdata instance
    2. Close runScatterFinCh so that runScatter() terminates and
       data processing is stopped for this kvdata instance
    3. Publish StreamEnd to feed to clear book-keeping and close
       all workers

Q: In which scenario runScatter will stop first, and in which scenario genServer will stop first ?
Line:658, secondary/projector/kvdata.go -> Minor: Check if these scenarios have corresponding log messages.

Normally genServer will stop first. This is the correct way of stopping KVData.

However, if there is any panic while processing the mutation, then it is possible that runScatter can exit first. In such cases, it will close genServer for a graceful exit.
Line:658, secondary/projector/kvdata.go -> All the errors from this method get logged at line 427
