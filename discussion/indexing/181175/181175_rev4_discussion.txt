DESCRIPTION:

MB-54090 Add support for single node swap rebalance in shard_rebalancer

In this case, the siblingTokenId would be empty for a transfer
token. Once the token becomes ready, master will go-ahead
and post a token with ShardTokenDropOnSource state with just
sourceTokenId. Source will drop the indexes once it sees
ShardTokenDropOnSource notification with the corresponding
transfer tokenId

Line:378, secondary/indexer/shard_rebalancer.go -> For replica repair cases, the source index doesn't need to be dropped(only s3 cleanup is required). Does it need to be handled differently? 

Also, there can be a case where there are 2 transfer tokens, one for moving source to another node and the second one for replica repair of the same index. If both are in the same batch, please check if the current mechanism can handle it.

This change is ready for review.
Line:378, secondary/indexer/shard_rebalancer.go -> Hi Deep, yes. Replica repair needs to be handled differently. Currently this code only supports swap rebalance. I will raise a separate patch for replica rebalance.

In case of replica rebalance, we need to check the transfer mode to decide on drop. I guess adding "replica repair" in the comment is misleading

Also, when there are 2 transfer tokens: One with replica repair & the other with normal index movements, they will not be batched together as the TransferModes are different. I will validate the case when we start supporting replica repair. Currently, we do not batch transfer tokens for replica repair at all.
