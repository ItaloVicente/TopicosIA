DESCRIPTION:

MB-32655 Propagate mutation arrival time from projector to indexer

The moving average value of mutation processing latency is propagated
every minute to indexer. The latency is calculated per stream per host.
Indexer adds its own latency to the projetor latency and returns the
overall latency

To identify from which host a mutation is being received, a map is
maintained (per bucket) between a vbucket and the host on which the
vbucket is active. This map is updated during stream_begin messages
and stream_end messages.

Line:829, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> when the stream gets cleaned up, we should clean up the latency map as well. Otherwise, the stats will keep showing for the stream which doesn't exist(e.g. init_stream after initial build finishes).

Line:681, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> We can remove "movingAvg" part from the stat name. projector_latency should be sufficient.

Line:94, secondary/projector/projector.go -> It would be better to retry before crashing.
