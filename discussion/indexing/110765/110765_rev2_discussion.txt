DESCRIPTION:

MB-32655 Propagate mutation arrival time from projector to indexer

The mutation arrival time is propagated every minute. The latency is
calculated per stream per host.

To identify from which host a mutation is being received, a map is
maintained (per bucket) between a vbucket and the host on which the
vbucket is active. This map is updated during stream_begin messages
and stream_end messages.

Patch Set 2:

To get around the problem of clock skew between nodes, a couple of options are possible:
1. Projector sends the "processing duration" to indexer rather than the clock time. Indexer can add its own processing duration and compute the total processing duration for a mutation.
2. Projector can send the "moving average" of processing time periodically. Indexer can add its own "moving average" of the processing time to compute the total moving average for mutation processing.

In both the cases, network transfer time doesn't get computed but the stats are reliable.
