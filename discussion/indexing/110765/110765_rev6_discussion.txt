DESCRIPTION:

MB-32655 Propagate mutation arrival time from projector to indexer

The moving average value of mutation processing latency is propagated
every minute to indexer. The latency is calculated per stream per host.
Indexer adds its own latency to the projetor latency and returns the
overall latency

To identify from which host a mutation is being received, a map is
maintained (per bucket) between a vbucket and the host on which the
vbucket is active. This map is updated during stream_begin messages
and stream_end messages.

Line:844, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> why do we need to send a message? why not call cleanLatencyMap directly from here.

Line:844, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> Stream begin messages are handled in handleWorkerMsgs() while cleanup is handled from run() go-routine. Calling the cleanupStream() here can lead to inconsistent latency map when INIT_STREAM cleans-up and stream-begin's come for MAINT_STREAM. To make sure only one go-routine updates the latency map, a message is sent to internalRecvCh

Line:844, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> okay. Please use a new message. CLEANUP_STREAM is already being used. maybe CLEANUP_STREAM_STATS to indicate its purpose.

Also, if there is a StreamBegin sitting in the mutMgrRecvCh and gets processed after the cleanup message, it can still have stats for deleted streams. You should check before initLatencyObj if the stream exists.

Line:1109, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> check stats != nil
