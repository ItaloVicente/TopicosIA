DESCRIPTION:

MB-32655 Propagate mutation arrival time from projector to indexer

The moving average value of mutation processing latency is propagated
every minute to indexer. The latency is calculated per stream per host.
Indexer adds its own latency to the projetor latency and returns the
overall latency

To identify from which host a mutation is being received, a map is
maintained (per bucket) between a vbucket and the host on which the
vbucket is active. This map is updated during stream_begin messages
and stream_end messages.

Line:12, secondary/dataport/endpoint_buffer.go -> cosmetic - do you want to rename it to something shorter e.g. lastCtimeSent or something. It stands out from the rest of the code.

Line:1250, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> it would be better to have VBMap as a type to have better code readability.

Line:680, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> I think we should only publish the movingAvg. Due to large number of stats, indexer logs are getting rolled over much faster.

Line:582, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> handleSingleKeyVersion just puts it in the queue. It doesn't represent the actual latency. We should just keep the projector stat for projector latency. What I meant in my earlier comment was that a user can add the projector + indexer latency to get the total latency. We have the stat for the indexer latency already.

Line:960, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> check for vbMap != nil

Line:963, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> get the map in line 962 and check if it is not nil before using.

Line:966, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> check latencyMap != nil before using

Line:41, secondary/projector/engine.go -> call the GetHostname function rather than using the variable?

Line:93, secondary/projector/projector.go -> ns-server can rename the hostname later.

Line:21, secondary/stats/avgvar.go -> this is a generic helper library. we should try to keep the changes generic. why do you need to add prjMovingAvg? How is it different from moving average calculations done in projector?

Line:12, secondary/dataport/endpoint_buffer.go -> Done

Line:1250, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> Done

Line:680, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> Done

Line:582, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Done

Line:960, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> The "Get()" method never returns nil value. Either it returns an empty map or a populated map. However, I have added a nil check to be on the safer side.

Line:963, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Done

Line:966, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Done

Line:41, secondary/projector/engine.go -> Done

Line:21, secondary/stats/avgvar.go -> I had a different understanding of how projector latency is added to indexer latency. This was the reason why I added prjMovingAvg. This change is no longer required.

For fixing the moving average calculation, I will handle it as a part of separate bug
