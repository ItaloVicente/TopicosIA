DESCRIPTION:

MB-32655 Propagate mutation arrival time from projector to indexer

The mutation arrival time is propagated every minute. The latency is
calculated per stream per host.

To identify from which host a mutation is being received, a map is
maintained (per bucket) between a vbucket and the host on which the
vbucket is active. This map is updated during stream_begin messages
and stream_end messages.
