DESCRIPTION:

MB-52931 Queue build tokens for rebalance instances

During rebalance, it is possible that a build token is
posted for an index but the index metadata is not updated
in repo yet (as the bucket might still be under rebalance).

In such cases, queue the build tokens to retryList so that
builder will attempt to build the index after bucket rebalance
is done
