DESCRIPTION:

MB-31959 Rename feed.cleanupBucket() to feed.cleanupKeyspace()

With collections, the projector book-keeping is made at keyspace level
and not at bucket level. Keyspace name is chosen by indexer. This patch
renames the feed.cleanupBucket() method to feed.cleanupKeyspace().
It also assumes that the keyspace name is same as bucket (until the
request from indexer is updated to contain keyspace name)
