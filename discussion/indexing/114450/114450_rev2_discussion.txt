DESCRIPTION:

MB-35328 Handling KV failover from indexer

When a node is failed over, it can take arbitrarily long time for
ns_server on the failed over node to realise the failover and act
on it. When it is a KV node that is failed over, in some cases
(E.g. indexer is ahead of replica and ns_server takes more than
20 minutes to realise the failover), this can lead to a rollback to
"0" for indexer

The rollback situation can be avoided to some extent by making indexer
to act pro-actively on KV node failover rather than waiting for ns_server
of the failed over node to terminate the projector process/ intimate
memcached about failover

In this fix, indexer process monitors the clusterInfoCache periodically
(every 5 sec) and keeps a track of hostnames of the KV failed over
nodes. When indexer observes any failed over nodes, it sends a message
to timekeeper to mark all the vb's belonging to the failed over KV host
as CONN_ERR and triggers repair

Line:7904, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Instead of fetching new cluster info every 5 secs, we could use the service change notifier. If there is any change in cluster topology, then new cluster info can be fetched. See meta_client.go.

Line:7958, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> won't this include the inactiveAdded nodes as well as those are present in kvNodeStatus but not in acitveKVNodes?

Line:7987, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> the check for stream bucket status here doesn't guarantee the stream bucket will be active when this message reaches timekeeper. It would be better to check in timekeeper and ignore.

Line:7995, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> sendMsgToWorker can only be called synchronously from the genServer. You will need to send the message to the main loop and then pass it on to the timekeeper.

Line:27, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> move this to stream state

Line:7904, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Done

Line:7958, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Yes. There are some cases where I wanted to clear the book-keeping at indexer. I have updated the code and included in the comments about the complete state transitions I am considering to act on a failover message. I have also modified the code to reflect these state transitions
