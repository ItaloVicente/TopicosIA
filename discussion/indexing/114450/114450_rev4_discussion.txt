DESCRIPTION:

MB-35328 Handling KV failover from indexer

When a node is failed over, it can take arbitrarily long time for
ns_server on the failed over node to realise the failover and act
on it. When it is a KV node that is failed over, in some cases
(E.g. indexer is ahead of replica and ns_server takes more than
20 minutes to realise the failover), this can lead to a rollback to
"0" for indexer

The rollback situation can be avoided to some extent by making indexer
to act pro-actively on KV node failover rather than waiting for ns_server
of the failed over node to terminate the projector process/ intimate
memcached about failover

Line:7901, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> KV_NODE_ACTIVE might be a better constant name. Similarly for other constants

Line:7930, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> If scn is not nil at this point, it will not get closed in error case

Line:7947, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> We are processing every notification. Please check if every notification needs processing here.

Line:7901, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Done

Line:7930, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> NewServicesChangeNotifier() either returns nil, err or scn, nil. So, at this point, scn would be nil

Line:7947, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Thanks for pointing this out Prathibha. Currently, we receive two notifications: ServiceChangeNotification, PoolChangeNotification. 

It is sufficient to process only PoolChangeNotification as any changes to ClusterMembership status would be reflected as a part of PoolChangeNotification. Processing ServiceChangeNotification would be redundant in this case. 

I have updated the code of process only PoolChangeNotification.
