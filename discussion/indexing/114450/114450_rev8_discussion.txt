DESCRIPTION:

MB-35328 Handling KV failover from indexer

When a node is failed over, it can take arbitrarily long time for
ns_server on the failed over node to realise the failover and act
on it. When it is a KV node that is failed over, in some cases
(E.g. indexer is ahead of replica and ns_server takes more than
20 minutes to realise the failover), this can lead to a rollback to
"0" for indexer

The rollback situation can be avoided to some extent by making indexer
to act pro-actively on KV node failover rather than waiting for ns_server
of the failed over node to terminate the projector process/ intimate
memcached about failover

Line:325, secondary/indexer/stream_state.go -> add to cleanup and reset methods below as well.

Line:1048, secondary/projector/projector.go -> creating a new cluster info cache on every projector request would generate garbage. How about listening to poolchangenotification in a goroutine and whenever there is a notification, update the hostaddress. The node rename should trigger the notification. We can double check that.

Line:325, secondary/indexer/stream_state.go -> Thanks for pointing this out Deep. Updated the clean-up code in patch set 9

Line:1048, secondary/projector/projector.go -> Updating hostname for every request is not required now as projector sends nodeUUID instead of hostname as a part of StreamBegin messages (http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/115985/). As node UUID is immutable as long as a node is a part of the cluster, we need not update it for every request.

Indexer does a conversion of node UUID to hostname while logging the projector latency stats
