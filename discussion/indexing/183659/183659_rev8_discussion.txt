DESCRIPTION:

MB-52931 Update rebalance phase at lifecycle manager

For the purpose of allowing DDL during rebalance, two
new variables are added at lifecycle manager:

a. rebalancePhase -> Captures the overall rebalance phase
   at lifecycle manager
b. bucketTransferPhase -> Captures the per bucket rebalance
   transfer phase

These two variables are updated at the time of rebalance
initialization (i.e. when registerRebalanceRunning is called)
and cleared when rebalance is done (i.e. when the key
"RebalanceRunning" is deleted from localmeta)

Shard rebalance adhers to the following protocol

a. Before starting actual transfer, rebalance master will
   update the global rebalance token with rebalance phase
   as "RebalanceInProgress" and also updates the token
   version to "AllowDDLDuringRebalance_v1"
b. All rebalance followers will see this token and update
   their internal book-keeping at lifecycle manager
c. Once the rebalancePhase at lifecycle manager moves to
   "RebalanceInProgress", it will start to allow DDL
   operations after resolving conflicts

The code for conflict resolution will be provided in later
patches
