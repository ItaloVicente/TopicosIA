DESCRIPTION:

MB-31947: Use greedy approach to place index during index creation



Backport to 7.0.1

SAPlanner uses simulated annealing method to find optimal index
placement. When the index is being created, the placement of existing
indexes won't change. Only the indexes that are newly getting created
will get placed optimally. For this, the planner finds the initial
node for the new indexes randomly - and then performs simulated
annealing to find the optimal target node. This step of performing
simulated annealing tries large number of solutions - by randomly moving
one new index to a differrent target node - in every step.

When a single index is getting created, with limited number of nodes
present in the cluster, finding the optimal solution should not require
large number of random index movements (performed by simulated annealing),
but deterministic placement should work trivially. The only exception being
the placement of index partitions. So, one can use a greedy approach
and place the new indexes on the least loaded nodes while making sure that
the replica and server group constraints are satisfied.
