DESCRIPTION:

MB-43886: Use bucketInfo in GetBucketUUID

* In cinfo variant for this API we are checking if atleast one node
  from the VBMap server list is present in the data from nodes endpoint
  output or not
* In cinfo lite if a bucket is deleted we delete the bucketInfo object
  from cache, using update from the PoolChangeNotification. Even when
  user is trying to force fetch the data, if the channel for bucket is
  deleted we query ns_server to verify and if the bucket is deleted we
  return error.
* So in cinfo lite if we are able to get the bucketInfo object the
  bucket can be assumed to be valid and we return the bucket UUID
