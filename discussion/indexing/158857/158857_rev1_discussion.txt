DESCRIPTION:

MB-46883: Rebalance failed with error index already exists

When node is failedover another index with same name as that of index on the failed node can be created, when the failed over node is added back to cluster, cluster now has duplicate index, these may or may not be equivalent indexes but they have same name. This sometimes causes rebalance to fail with error index already exists. The fix addresses the issue by detecting the duplicate indexes and deleting the duplicate index if they are equivalant. In case of duplicate indexes being non-equivalant system behaves as it used to behave earlier which means there is a chance of rebalance failure with index already exists.

There are lot of white spaces that needs to be removed.
Line:210, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> I think it would be good to retry this "/dropIndex" once as failure of this can lead to rebalance failures. See MB-46039 as to why it can fail and how retry can help. We can probably address this in a separate patch

Line:1004, secondary/planner/executor.go -> This function looks like an O(n*n) algorithm. I think we should optimise this if possible. May be we can add a TODO in this patch and deal with it in separate patch

The function groupEquivalent is indeed n2 and can be improved further a bit will take that as a separate patch because it is called only for duplicate indexes.

The drop index retry comment, thanks for pointing out will add the retry loop with few retries.
