DESCRIPTION:

MB-44787 Wait for VbucketWorker::run() to finish when exiting genServer

If genServer() exits before VbucketWorker::run() is completely
terminated, there exists a possibility of some workers waiting
to write to endpoint's reqCh. However, KVData would assume that
all the workers are closed.

At this point, if indexer restarts stream, then there exists two
sets of workers - One from the current active stream and the other
from previously closed stream. This can lead to atmost one mutation
being written out of order into endpoint reqCh and can violate the
sequence number ordering at indexer.

This patch addresses the issue by waiting for all vbucket workers to
properly terminate the mutation processing go-routine. Any ongoing
processing will be aborted if the endpoint reqCh is full
