DESCRIPTION:

MB-31955 Support filtering of mutations at worker based on collectionID

When DCP stream is opened for entire bucket, mutations beloning to all
collections will be streamed by KV. However, not all mutations need to
be evaluated. Only those mutations that belong to the collections for
which instances are added at worker will be evaluated. For all other
mutations, an UpdateSeqno message will be propagated to indexer for
book-keeping updates

Line:600, secondary/projector/worker.go -> Why do we need this? I am not up to date with the design.

Line:607, secondary/projector/worker.go -> I think we should not suppress error here.

Line:600, secondary/projector/worker.go -> In instance definition, we store collection ID as string (Because KV gives it as string and it is easy to distinguish between a collection aware index defn - collectionID would not be empty and a non-collection aware index defn - CollectionID would be empty).

For a collection aware stream, decoding collectionID to uint32 in datapath is easy and faster. Hence, this method converts the hexa decimal string in index defn. to uint32 for book-keeping at worker

Line:607, secondary/projector/worker.go -> Thanks for the suggestion about CrashOnError. In the updated code, this method will crash on error if collection ID is not a hexa-decimal string
