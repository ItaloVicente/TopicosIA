DESCRIPTION:

MB-47254 (7.1.0 1910) Avoid log flooding from watcherServer connect fail

In a cluster with a large number of Index nodes, a long-lived network
partition flooded the logs with error messages from watcherServer.go
runOnce(), because even though the retries backed off to be 30 seconds
apart for each peer, these retries were ongoing for attempts to contact
all other Index nodes, which multiplies their frequency by the number of
such nodes. This made indexer.log wrap in less than an hour at one
customer.

The retry loops were also leaking a Timer goroutine with each iteration,
potentially building up many thousands of leaked Timers running forever,
which could eventually affect the Go scheduler, especially as they are
all ticking at integer numbers of seconds from their start times, which
themselves are all one second apart in a network partition case because
of a foreground 1-second wait for success by the outer caller,
metadata_provider.go WatchMetadata(), before switching to background
forever waits.

The fix is:

1. Only log the connection failure messages for each peer on first
   failure and then every 100 retries thereafter. I also added the try
   number and the hostname with which contact failed to the logging.

2. Stop the old Timer before creating a new Timer in each retry loop
   iteration.

3. Change the 1000 ms foreground wait in WatchMetadata() to 971 ms,
   a prime number, to prevent the retry Timers from all waking up on
   1-second harmonics of the start of launch if the network is in fact
   partitioned.
