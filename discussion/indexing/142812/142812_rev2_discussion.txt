DESCRIPTION:

MB-42194 Enable firstSnap optimisation for deletes in MOI

This will speed up initial index build performance when there
are large number of partial indexes being built at the same time.
With this optimisation, MOI doesnot have to process upsertDelete
messages from projector when the mutations belong to first snapshot

For updates, the firstSnap optimisation is inherently present
in the code. So, it does not have to be handled explicitly

Line:375, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Q: In plasma, in case of first snap, this is set to opInsert. Why not here as well ?

This change is ready for review.
Line:375, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Hi Amit, Good point. I think we need to change the nodeTable interface to provide Insert()
method that can handle firstSnap optimisation.

In the current code, Update() does a look up into nodeTable and then if it does not find the
node, it would insert in the nodeTable. This look-up can be avoided with the firstSnap optimisation as we already know this is the first time a document is being streamed. This
would make initial index builds even faster with MOI.

Will update the code to handle this scenario as well.

Patch Set 2:

Upon analysing the code further, I don't see any way firstSnap optimisation would help insertions.
When a new mutation is inserted, MOI has to look in both hash tables (slowHT and fastHT) and only
then determine the absence/presence of a key in back-index.

These look-ups can not be avoided due to the possibility of conflicts in CRC hash i.e. each indexed entry with be hashed and the key to the nodeTable will be the hash. So, it is possible that
two different entries can be assigned same hash. In that case, MOI looks into slowHT to resolve the conflict. 

Hence, even for mutations in first snapshot, the CRC32 hash of the indexed key can already exist due
to a prior mutation. Irrespective of whether the mutation is insert or update, MOI has to look in the
hash tables. 

For deletes, this is not the case. In first snapshot, a delete mutation can not precede insert
mutation and it is not possible to have both insert and delete for the same document in first snapshot. For first snapshot, it is only upsertDel messages sent by projector that would act as delete mutations at indexer. Those can be avoided for first snapshot.
