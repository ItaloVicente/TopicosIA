Line:202, secondary/dataport/endpoint.go -> Not using atomic access ?

Line:96, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> No using atomic access ?

Line:98, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Stats are not transactionally updated. That is, while reading the stats
some fields might have latest value, while others don't. At best this could lead to round of errors and at worst makes debugging difficult.

Line:37, secondary/stats/avgvar.go -> Do we need this entire function transactional ?

Line:202, secondary/dataport/endpoint.go -> Thanks for the review Pratap.

This does not require atomic access as stats pointer is initialised once and never updated. Also, this pointer is read only after a response is received on channel when the update happens. Therefore this is guaranteed to get the latest value of the pointer (https://golang.org/ref/mem - Section "Channel communication" discusses a similar example)

Please let me know if you feel otherwise
