DESCRIPTION:

MB-48229: Fix race between build index command and it's token processing

The race condition can menifest if the events take place in following
order.

1. Build Command Token is posted.
2. Build index request is sent to indexer.
3. Before recieving the build request, indexer observes build token
   and starts processing the token.
4. Indexer proceeds with indexer.handleBuildIndex (token processing callback)
   and sends an async msg to gometa server to update the index state at
   the manager. Indexer returns the control to lifecycle manager.
5. Before gometa server can forward this state update to lifecycle
   manager, the build index request (from step 2) is picked up
   by lifecycle manager.
6. Lifecycle manager triggers the index build (and calls indexer
   indexer.handleBuildIndex - request processing callback) because the state
   change from the token processing callback hasn't yet reached the lifecycle
   manager.
7. During request processing callback, the indexer observes the state
   updated during the token processing callback and hence, build index returns
   the invalid state error.
