DESCRIPTION:

MB-50006 Send INMEM_SNAP for flush inspite of noChange

In some corner cases, it is possible for timekeeper to send
NO_SNAP timestamps to storage manager even if all the mutations
are processed in a stream. This is due to fast flush mode and
mayBeMakeSnapAligned() method. If the last NO_SNAP timestamp
is completely snapshot aligned, then the following INMEM_SNAP
timestamps will be skipped from flushing if there is no change
in the seqno. in timestamp.

This can lead to storage manager using stale snapshot data i.e.
stale INMEM_SNAP data which can result in session consistent scan
timeouts or panics during partition merge.

This patch fixes the issue by forcing an INMEM_SNAP or DISK_SNAP even
if there is no change in timestamp from last flushed NO_SNAP timestamp.
Additionally, a new stat: num_forced_inmem_snap to count the number of
such occurances and log the timestamp every 1000th occurance
