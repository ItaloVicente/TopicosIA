DESCRIPTION:

MB-47787: [memdb] Add user managed memory support for default skliplist

 dcas correctness requires that a) we atomically update delete flag &
 next pointer address b) make sure next pointer remains visibile
 during golang garbage collection when using golang pointers

 In addition for platform's such as aarch64, we have to make sure
 skiplist operates on 64-bit aligned pointers when using 64-bit atomic
 operations.

 (ARMv8 findings: https://docs.google.com/document/d/19UxiAT8bMM5xqe8y9l3mtcKE-9McQEUVgFlzycnE2Lk/edit?usp=sharing)

 Based on experimental patches,
 (http://review.couchbase.org/c/nitro/+/159836), it looks hard to
 have an unified way to deal with both golang pointers as well as
 user managed memory pointers such that we observe all the above
 conditions (unless the underlying platform supports 128-bit atomics).

 This patch extends the existing platform independent default
 implementation to support user managed memory pointers using tagged pointer
 approach (borrowing from previously reviewed patch). This addresses
 the alignment issue for aarch64 and also has the advantage of using
 lesser memory (4%) for skiplist and a single atomic CAS in dcasNext.

 For golang memory, we continue using existing indirect NodeRef pointer
 based approach.
