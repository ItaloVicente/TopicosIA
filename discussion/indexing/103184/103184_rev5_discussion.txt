Line:5028, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Updating scan coordinator should be the last step, isn't it?  We want the storage manager to be aware of the instance + snapshot first. Having said that, it probably will work since scan coordinator will wait for the snapshot to arrive, but this means we are letting scan coordinator aware of the index before it is actually ready.

Line:5040, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> If there is an error, I think we should not return error.  This will stop the other index from recovery.   This may also make this indexer fails to bootstrap if one instance is bad.      We should log the error and continue.

Line:1034, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> During bootstrap, if the index has not been warmed up, we should not find the index, isn't it?  How can we come to this code path?

Line:5028, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Sure, let me think about it.

Line:5040, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Sure that makes sense - if allowing scan for one warmed up index fails, it should not block from other indexes from warming up. Having said that, we return error in this function if idx.initPartnInstance(...) fails. Do we need to change that behavior too?

Line:1034, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> During bootstrap, we have indexes in indexInstMap. What we dont have is partitions initialised. Hence we arrive at this code path.
