Line:4685, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Q: Do we still need this block here (as initFromPersistedState() has the same block to create NewStorageManager() as well)?

Line:4949, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> This seems to be unused at the moment.

Line:32, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> Q: Should we consider a different error for "index not warmed up yet" instead of combining with ErrNotMyIndex?

Line:4685, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> It is needed as indexInstanceMap could be empty (no indexes present in the system).

Line:32, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> Yes, I thought of it. We can discuss offline

Line:4676, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> We can init the storage manager unconditionally before doing initFromPersistedState. And then for each index warmup, we send the message for updating the snap map. That will simplify the code and remove duplication.

Line:4956, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Didn't understand this code block. Isn't it the duplicate of line 4967-4971?

Line:5009, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Not required here. This can be moved ahead of initFromPersistedState.

Line:5024, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> These messages cannot be sent directly as it is in a goroutine. It will first need to be sent to internalRecvch and then handled by the indexer main loop.

Line:5030, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> same as above.

Line:5035, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> same as above.

Line:594, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> We should also consider the case when there are no KV Mutations. Can we support other consistency options? There consistency options are baked into the application and may not be easy to change.

Line:595, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> Lets use "warmup" instead of "bootstrap" to be consistent with other messages.

Line:1448, secondary/indexer/storage_manager.go -> We can move needRestart inside updateIndexSnapMapForIndex. Once a restart is required, no further processing is needed.
