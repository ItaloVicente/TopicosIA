Line:1678, secondary/planner/planner.go -> What would be the length of this maps? I would assume it is proportional to the number of indexes being built. Otherwise, we can use some form of cache like double buffering to avoid repeated allocations.

Line:1678, secondary/planner/planner.go -> Thanks for the suggestion 😊

(1) with respect to create/alter index, the eligible index map will have all replicas and partitions of a single index. So, the size of the map will be fairly small. 

(2) With respect to rebalance, there can be many indexes being moved, but rebalance is a rare activity. 

Overall, I think that the garbage being generated is a much smaller problem, and can be solved when we need that to be fixed. Having said that, as a part of overall planner scalability, more scalability tests will be run and such problems (related to garbage) can creep up. If they do, we will solve them then.
