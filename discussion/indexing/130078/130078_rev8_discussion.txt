Line:2294, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> scheduled tokens are not expected to be many at any given point(in lot of cases there may not be any. We can avoid giving capacity here and just let append deal with it.

Line:2462, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> There are 2 bookkeepings. One in the listener and one here. If you want to keep those in sync, it is better to take this lock at the start of this function. If your code can deal with that when getIndexStatus(and this function) gets called concurrently, then it should be fine.

Line:2294, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> Done. It was one list per process. So, I felt it was okay to have a few Kbs worth of list. Anyways, fixed it.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2462, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> Done. Taken a lock across the entire function. This should not have any synchronisation problems.
