DESCRIPTION:

MB-35108 (7.1.0 1558) Get mutex for sysconf accesses + performance fixes

1. Add RLock/RUnlock of the confLock mutex wherever they were missing in
   plasma_slice.go, memdb_slice_impl.go, and forestdb_slice_writer.go.

2. Move one of these out of a loop it did not need to be inside.

3. plasmaSlice.initStores() eliminate extra copying of the large Config
   struct. (Also opened MB-49284 for more such expensive copies in
   Plasma constructors.)

4. In memdb and fdb, standardized all slice "this" pointers to be named
   mdb and fdb, respectively. Most of them were already but a few were
   different. (I did not do the same for plasma as this would touch many
   hundreds of lines, as currently 2/3 use "mdb" and 1/3 use "slice".
