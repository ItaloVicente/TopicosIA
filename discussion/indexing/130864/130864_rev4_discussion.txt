Line:388, secondary/common/config.go -> I suppose this is in seconds. Default is 50 seconds ?

Line:204, secondary/projector/stats_manager.go -> I suppose the else part here is for safety measure, may be it is better to use constants instead of hard-coding the numbers within the code. Even better we can have the config-constants under common/config.go and use them in ConfigValue and also in other parts of the code.

Line:213, secondary/projector/stats_manager.go -> Should this be seconds ?

Line:389, secondary/common/config.go -> 50 Microsecond. So, we are talking about 20 K mutations being evaluated per second. With very high load (or CPU contention) on the projector - This threshold won't really be useful. We can make at least 1 millisecond as threshold (or even 10 milliseconds).

My point is: I am not sure if evaluation is taking 51 microseconds, that can lead to a CBSE - esp in production scenarios.

Line:357, secondary/projector/stats_manager.go -> Minor: Atomic load can be done once per iteration of the external for loop.

Line:383, secondary/projector/stats_manager.go -> Minor: Not sure if we need this line. I am doubtful if we will have these kind of log messages for all threshold based logs.

This change is ready for review.
Line:388, secondary/common/config.go -> No. This is set at microseconds. Eval stats average is computed in nano seconds. When we compare in projector stats_manager, we multiply the threshold by 1000 and convert to nano seconds

Line:389, secondary/common/config.go -> A simple index: create index idx_1 on default(name) would take around 4us (on dessert cluster). My rationale for setting this at 50us was to give sufficient room for complex indexes and large documents. 

Increased it further to 200us. This means that if any index is processing less than 5k mutations per second, then i think we can consider it sufficiently complex to impact query latency.

Line:204, secondary/projector/stats_manager.go -> Done. Defaulted these values using constants.

Line:357, secondary/projector/stats_manager.go -> Done

Line:383, secondary/projector/stats_manager.go -> Done. Removed this line
