DESCRIPTION:

MB-32087: Handle scan requests when snapshot TS is ahead of request TS

If scan has SessionConsistency option and latest snapshot that
scan coordinator knows has timestamp that is ahead of bucket KV TS
available in scan request, then switch to using the new SessionConsistencyStrict
which behaves similar to QueryConsistency i.e. compares both seqnos and
vbuuids of scan request with snapshot before serving the scans. This is
done so that scans after bucket flush do no return incorrect results. With
this new mode consistency, the session consistent scans wait till a
snapshot is consistent with both KV seq nos and vbuuids is available.

Also, enable this new behavior with the config setting
indexer.enable_session_consistency_strict (default is true)
