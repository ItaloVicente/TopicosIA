Line:115, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> For a low level helper method like operations monitor, I think it would be better to avoid using panic/recover. The code will be simpler if a lock is taken to protect the state. A read lock can be taken here and write lock in Close. As Close is not going to be called often, read lock would be very cheap.

Line:178, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> this check is not very useful. The operations channel can close anytime.

Line:183, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> len is not thread safe. Better to rely on currOpsCount instead.

Line:178, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> There is a separate check for operation channel being closed. 

This check is required if there are no operations when close is called. We need a mechanism to get out of outer loop in this case.
