Line:96, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Looks like AddOperation() and Close() aren't thread safe. We may crash here if m.operations is closed before we write. We may need a lock

Line:161, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> monitor checks only 1 operation every m.interval? Shouldn't we check for all operations queued? It's probably ok, but would be better to state that m.interval should be sufficiently small (like in msec) to ensure OPs get a chance to be checked.

Line:96, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> As discussed offline, there is recovery code to handle this race. I don't want to add a lock to prevent contention during AddOperation.

Line:161, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Done. Earlier code would have worked fine for kv_sender use cases, so it was intentional. But with 1000s of snapshot operations being added to monitor every 10 ms, 1 operation every m.interval won't work. So, fixed this part.
