Line:55, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Cosmetic: rename to *currOpsCount*

Line:56, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Cosmetic: rename to *maxOps*

Line:111, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Q: when can this happen? do we need an error log here?

Line:155, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Q: This means we can't call Monitor() on an OperationsMonitor() more than once, right?

Line:176, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Q: Is it possible to print the reason for exiting?

Line:190, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Q: What is the value add in printing skipped count?

Line:209, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> If multiple threads try to close it, you will get this warning on n-1 threads. Perhaps, we don't need a log here.
Also, don't we need close(m.operations) here as well?

Line:34, secondary/indexer/kv_sender.go -> Q: why 20000?

Line:111, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Yes, with atomic.AddInt64 guarding this, there is no need to have select statement here.

Line:155, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Yes. Removed this. monitor() is now called from the constructor.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:176, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Yes. added more information to this log message - so that it can be differentiated from the isClosed() messages. Although it does not make much difference.

Line:190, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Removed this. Now, AddOperation will return success / failure to the caller.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:209, secondary/common/op_monitor.go -> Removed the state. Maintain only a single variable "closed" to ensure Close happens only once.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:34, secondary/indexer/kv_sender.go -> This is just capacity. This is a moderately high number to ensure that AddOperation rarely fails. As multiple indexes share same stream, its highly unlikely to have these many outstanding requests in kv_sender.
