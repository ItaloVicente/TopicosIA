DESCRIPTION:

MB-37839 Delete feed stats from book-keeping upon feed's shutdown

When an endpoint exits, the shutdown() method of a feed is called to 
gracefully shutdown the feed. However, this will not clean-up the
feed stats at projector.

This patch addresses the issue by cleaning the feed stats at projector 
on feed's shutdown
