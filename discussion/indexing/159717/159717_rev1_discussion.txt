DESCRIPTION:

MB-47916 : Support Encrypted Port Map in cluster_run like setup

* Currently we dont update Encrypted Port Maps when we add new nodes
  If the new nodes have a different node mapping that http to https
  mapping will not be updates in old cluster if security is already
  enabled.
* If these new nodes map same http port to different https port this
  will still be a problem.
* Add a function watch for Notifiations from ns_server and keep updating
  the encrypted port map also update the maps in StartTopologyChange for
  Rebalance Master

Line:640, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Please follow the similar logging scheme as other methods.

Line:654, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Is a new cluster info cache required or can security.SetEncryptPortMapping be added to an existing one?

Line:430, secondary/security/tls_setting.go -> lock is not required as atomic store is being used.

Line:447, secondary/security/tls_setting.go -> lock is not required as atomic load is being used.

Line:455, secondary/security/tls_setting.go -> lock is not required as atomic load is being used.

Line:640, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Sorry will update that.

Line:654, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Yes i think we can update only nodes and nodeSvs here and use the existing one. I thought it might be an issue if cinfoClient did not update the cache by the time we update it here.

Line:430, secondary/security/tls_setting.go -> I thought lock might be needed as there were two atomic stores. If some go routine tries to get a encryptPortmap and encryptPorts while other is updating both. Will it be possible for it to get one map updated and other one un updated ?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:430, secondary/security/tls_setting.go -> That's a valid point. We can just keep the lock instead of atomic. Both are not required. It is okay for this patch.
