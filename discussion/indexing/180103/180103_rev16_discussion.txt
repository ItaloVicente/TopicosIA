DESCRIPTION:

MB-52933 Handle cleanup of ShardTokens after rebalance

Cleanup of rebalance tokens is invoked in various scenarios like
rebalance failure, before start of rebalance/failover (incase
rebalance is pending etc).

During cleanup rebalance service manager will read all tokens from
metakv and processes each token one after the other. The cleanup
action is taken based on the ShardTransferTokenState.

For ShardTokenCreated, ShardTokenCommit, ShardTokenDeleted states,
master will delete the shard tokens from metaKV.

For ShardTokenScheduledOnSource, source node will delete the token
from metaKV. In future, when DDL during rebalance is supported,
indexer may have to cleanup some book-keeping for this state.

For ShardTokenScheduleAck, destination node will delete the
token from metaKV.

For ShardTokenTransferShard, source node will cleanup any data on
remote destination and delete the token from metaKV

For ShardTokenRestoreShard, destination node will cleanup all the
data on remote destination and local file system. Since indexe
instances will not be created in this state, indexes will not
be dropped on destination node (as indexes does not exist yet)

For ShardTokenRecoverShard, destination node will cleanup data on
remote destination, local file system and drops all index instances
that are created during rebalance on destintion node

For ShardTokenReady state, source node will check the presence of
any "ShardTokenDropOnSource" tokens for this token in metaKV. If
one exists, it will drop the index instances on source and destroy
the shard. If the token does not exist, then the instances will
be dopped on destination and token is cleaned up.
