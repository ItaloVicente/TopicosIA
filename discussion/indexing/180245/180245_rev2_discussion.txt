DESCRIPTION:

MB-53664, MB-52790 - fixing intermediate index build failures

cbindex tool attempts to get index information from metadata cache

This info can be stale if we did not sync with GSI completely first
Sync issue is happening mainly due to uninitialised clusterVer in
clientAuth which results in unauthorised syncWithPeer which is
rejected by the server. clusterVer can be uninitialised as it is
fetched in a separate goroutine.
Due to this sync issue, watchers are not started but we have async
routines in background waiting for them to start

Hence introducing a new Catchup func to synchronously wait for the
background helpers to finish. It polls to check if all watchers
are alive at interval duration for a max duration of:
    (10000*interval+1)ms
