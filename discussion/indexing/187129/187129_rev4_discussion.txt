DESCRIPTION:

MB-54138 Add pendingCreate indexes to transfer token

For indexes where CreateCommand token is posted but the index
does not exist on the node (i.e. it is yet to be created), the
index will be marked pendingCreate. During rebalance, planner
can decide to move all pendingCreate indexes to a different node.

It is important to move the pendingCreate indexes as a part of
shard rebalance inorder to not violate the cluster affinity. E.g.,
consider the following case:

a. Index creation for idx_1 started on nodes n1 & n2
b. On n1, index creation succeeded and a CreateCommandToken got
   posted
c. Node n2 could not finish processing due to various issues
d. Before DDL service manager could attempt to create the index on n2,
   rebalance started and planner decided to move the indexes of bucket
   to n3, n4 (i.e. n1->n3 & n2 -> n4)
e. n1->n3 can proceed without any problem
f. As index is in pendingCreate state on n2, if the index is not considered
   for n2->n4 movement then after rebalance, the index gets recreated on
   n2. Therefore, the indexes of this bucket exists on n1, n2, n4 and this
   violates cluster affinity.

This patch is first in the series which includes all pendingCreate in the
rebalance transfer token. If no transfer token already exists, a new transfer
token will be created.
