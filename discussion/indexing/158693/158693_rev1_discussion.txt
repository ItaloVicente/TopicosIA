DESCRIPTION:

MB-47631 Do not remove keyspace stats during recovery

BP of MB-47622 to 7.0.1

Keyspace stats contain some information like num_rollbacks,
num_rollbacks_to_zero which indicate the number of times the
stream has been rolled back. During recovery, if the keyspace
stats are removed, then this information is lost and the stats
become useless.

This patch addresses the issue by not removing the keyspace
stats during recovery loop. If recovery fails due to stream
becoming inactive, then the stats are removed. In all other
cases, the keyspace stats are removed
