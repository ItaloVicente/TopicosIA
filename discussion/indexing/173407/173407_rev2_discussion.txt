DESCRIPTION:

MB-51682 [BP to 7.0.4] Prevent connection object leak by deleting closed connections

Prior to this patch, a closed connection object is never removed
from the s.conns slice. So, all the memory of the conn. object
is held up in memory.

This patch fixes the issue by deleting a closed connection from
book-keeping
