Line:124, secondary/cmd/indexer/main.go -> Do you want to clean up the target directory before copying?

Line:134, secondary/cmd/indexer/main.go -> Let say that it cannot remove the old directory (lower case), so there will be some files left over.    But the new directory (mixed case) will be used for indexer.  Let say indexer restarted.  During bootstrap, it will see the old directory exists, then it will copy over those files to the new directory (mixed case).   This will cause data loss as it will overwrite files in new directories.     One option is to continue to use the lower case directory until the whole operation is successful (including clean up).
