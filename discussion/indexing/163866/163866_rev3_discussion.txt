DESCRIPTION:

MB-45484 Incrementally update bootstrap stats

With the current logic, the entire payload of bootstrap
stats is marshalled and sent to lifecycle manager. With
10000 indexes on a node, the time to marshall and
unmarshal the stats for 10000 indexes takes long time and
this can delay indexer getting ready.

To avoid this, instead of sending the entire stats payload,
only the stats of the index which got recovered are sent to
lifecycle manager. The client related stats are updated by
timekeeper which can only process the stats for the instances
once storage warm-up is done. This means that all client stats
for each index will contain the values initialised during
bootstrap - until storage warm-up is done. So, it is safe to
send only the stats for the index.

Line:7317, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Q: Can we use consumer filter for this? Otherwise, it will become difficult to maintain this list at multiple places.

Line:2650, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> Q: Why do we need to Clone here ? stats is just initialised here, right ?

This change is ready for review.
Line:7317, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> As discussed offline, here we are setting per index stats. Hence, we may not be able to use consumer filter

Line:2650, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> The clone is on m.stats. So, lifecycle manager keeps a copy of all the stats received so far. When new update comes, it clones its entire list, add this stats of new indexes and then updates the global copy.

Since broadcastStats also runs simultaneously, we need Copy-on-Write scheme. Hence, we require the clone
