DESCRIPTION:

MB-45919 Part 3: Reduce O(N^2) work to O(N) for deleted indexes

This Part 3 is intended to be the final patch to complete this MB fix.

This patch reduces the previous O(N^2) algorithm for processing mass
index deletes due to dropped buckets or collections to O(N). O(N^2)
was caused by the following methods in indexer.go:
  1. Bucket drop: handleKeyspaceNotFound()
  2. Collection drop: cleanupIndexDataForCollectionDrop()

These methods were iterating over the dropped indexes and calling
cleanupIndexData() on them one by one = O(N) cleanup calls. Each
call updated two maps to delete the current index being processed,
distributed them to all seven workers, and deleted the associated
slices. The second factor of N came from the fact that the average map
size distributed was also O(N), since at the start all N indexes were
in the maps, and each of the N iterations decremented this by one and
redistributed the maps, so the N map distributions contained at least
(N-1), (N-2), ..., 1, 0 indexes, the average of which is ~N/2.

The fix is to push the iteration down into cleanupIndexData(), where
it performs all N map updates and distributes the final (smallest)
maps once. Thus N distributions are done of constant-sized maps,
reducing the algorithmic complexity from O(N^2) to O(N).
