DESCRIPTION:

MB-45919 Part 2: Add indexer high-priority message channel

This patch adds a new message channel, wrkrPrioRecvCh, to indexer for
high-priority worker messages and changes ServiceMgr methods
checkDDLRunning() and registerRebalanceRunning() to use this channel
because these are called under PrepareTopologyChange(), and we want to
avoid having their messages queued up behind other work that would
cause this API call from ns_server to timeout and fail the rebalance.

indexer.run() main loop now iterates over two subtasks:
  1. Process all messages present in the high-priority channel, if any
  2. Process the next message from any channel

This change will prevent PrepareTopologyChange timeouts due to a long
work queue, provided the current message indexer is processing when a
high-priority message arrives does not take excessive time to finish.
It's not possible to process high-priority messages asynchronously
without major overhaul, as indexer relies on being single-threaded to
prevent concurrent reads and writes of its data structures, but a
sparsely-used high-priority message channel accomplishes the same end.
