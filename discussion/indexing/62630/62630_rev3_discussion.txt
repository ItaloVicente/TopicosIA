DESCRIPTION:

MB-19005: projector, copy keys from DcpEvent to endpoint.

copying this key will generate more garbage but will reduce
the number of references. this helps in two ways,
1. once DcpEvent (holding the mutated document) is transformed to
   endpoint structure (holding the secondary keys), former can be
   collected.
2. projector sizing calculations become more realistic.
