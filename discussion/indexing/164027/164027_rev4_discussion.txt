DESCRIPTION:

MB-46320 Wait on responseCh for clustMgrAgent requests during bootstrap

With http://review.couchbase.org/c/indexing/+/156184, the bootstrap1
code path is being made asyncronous. This means that there can be
two go-routines writing to clustMgrAgentCmdCh at the same time.

In the current scheme of things, indexer writes a message to
clustMgrAgentCmdCh and expects a response from the same channel.
This scheme works as long as there is only one go-routine reading
and writing from the channel. When there is more than one go-routine
involved, there can be out-of-order message processing.

E.g., go-routine 1 writes cmd1 and waits for response for cmd1.
      go-routine 2 writes cmd2 but the waiter for cmd1 would
      incorrectly read cmd2 as the response for cmd1 (as go-routine1
      is waiting on the same channel for response on which other
      go-routines are writing their commands)

To avoid this, during bootstrap, each message will initialise a local
responseCh and explicitly wait on it.
