DESCRIPTION:

MB-52927 Update transfer token structure for shard transfer rebalance

a. The existing transfer token structure has been updated to
   contain all index instance IDs that belong to a shard and
   will be moved to a different node due to rebalance
b. A new "Version" field is added which will help distinguish
   between older transfer (DCP based rebuild) vs newer transfer
   (shard based transfer)
c. The state of the transfer token for shard based rebalance is
   captured in "shardTokenState" variable as against existing
   "tokenState" variable
