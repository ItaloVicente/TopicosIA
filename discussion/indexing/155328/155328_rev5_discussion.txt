Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Minor: Both deferred and non-deferred

Line:2558, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> Is this required - as we are deleting all create command tokens for this keyspace at line 2570

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:2558, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> I am not sure, since existing code for deferred index cleanup as well as handleCollectionDelete has it, i kept it as it is just to be on safer side. Though looking at code one of the two calls is not needed. I will check with Amit if there is any case where both calls are needed and get back.

Line:2558, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> Hi Varun, I checked 6.6.2 code and also discussed with Amit, two calls are there in 6.6.2 as well and we could not conclude on why two calls there. Only one possibility I see is the fix that I had done ListAndFetchCreateCommandToken which was not returning anything, that may be reason where despite a call to  DeleteAllCreateCommandToken some of the tokens not being deleted and hence the call to deleteCreateTokensForCollection at end of function to delete all tokens of a collection. Any way I will keep both calls there for safety and open a new MB to investigate if we need two calls or not.
