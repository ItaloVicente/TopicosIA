There are two requirements in this MB.
1. Fail fast
2. Selectively listen on ipv4/ipv6 based on setting.

This patch addresses the fail fast requirement.

For selective listen, I am working on a patch but I am facing a blocker issue. That issue is mentioned in the last comment on the MB. Once that blocker is fixed, I will share the second patch for review. 

Note that this needs to be back ported, so I am taking an easier way out for fail fast. Otherwise, something like http://review.couchbase.org/c/indexing/+/121715 also can be done.
