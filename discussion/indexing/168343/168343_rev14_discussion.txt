DESCRIPTION:

MB-49382 Part 1 (7.1.0 2012) Indexer use cgroups CPU info when enabled

1. cpu_throttle.go should use cgroup CPU usage stats when cgroups are
   supported. This is so the usage is correctly calculated against the
   number of CPUs allocated to the cgroup rather than the whole node.
   If not supported fall back to the standard algorithm of CPU ticks in
   different categories that is collected for the whole node.

2. Indexer set number of CPUs to min(node, cgroup, GSI) available CPUs,
   where cgroup is sigar num_cpu_prc when cgroups are supported and GSI
   is config value indexer.settings.max_cpu_percent (exposed on UI as
   Advanced Index Settings / Indexer Threads).

3. Log message to console if, in #2, GSI > min(node, cgroup) and use the
   latter instead.

4. planner/proxy.go RetrievePlanFromCluster was calling
   getIndexSettings() to set CpuQuota based on runtime.NumCPUs() and
   indexer.settings.max_cpu_percent, but the code in that method was
   incorrect. Replaced with a call to runtime.GOMAXPROCS(0) which will
   now get the logical min(node, cgroup, GSI) per #2 above. (Note that
   CpuQuota is not used in Planner anyway -- its enforcement is
   commented out in planner/planner.go Validate().) This changes
   eliminates REST calls to all remote indexer nodes and a use of
   ClusterInfoCache.
