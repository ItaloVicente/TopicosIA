DESCRIPTION:

MB-49382 (7.1.0 2012) Indexer use cgroups CPU and mem info when enabled

This is to use the Linux control groups ("cgroups") CPU and memory info
from sigar in Indexer when cgroups are supported. (MB-49381 is the
sister bug for Projector.)

1. cpu_throttle.go should use cgroup CPU usage stats when cgroups are
   supported. This is so the usage is correctly calculated against the
   number of CPUs allocated to the cgroup rather than the whole node.
   If not supported fall back to the standard algorithm of CPU ticks in
   different categories that is collected for the whole node.

2. Indexer needs to set its number of CPUs to the smaller of its own
   override indexer.settings.max_cpu_percent or the value num_cpu_prc
   from sigar in the case where cgroups are supported.

[Additional pieces TBD.]
