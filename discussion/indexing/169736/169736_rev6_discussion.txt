DESCRIPTION:

MB-50664: Indexes stuck at state building in travel-sample bucket

In checkInitialBuildDone if buildTs is zero we mark the initBuildDone as true and proceed with TK_INIT_BUILD_DONE.
This is not sufficent in OSO mode as flushTs can have open OSO snapshots.
When MAINT_STREAM is not yet started this flushTs with its openOSOSnapshot flag gets set on the MAINT_STREAM. Later in checkInitStreamReadyToMerge it can get set back to INIT_STREAM.
Due to this even when actual ts does not have any OSOSnapshot markers the openOSOSnapshot flag on ts is true which prevents the INIT_STREAM from merging into MAINT_STREAM
with error - has open OSO snapshot.

Fix: In the cehckInitialBuildDone even when buildTs is all zero do not mark initBuildDone as true in OSO mode.

Line:2273, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> I hope reordering does not break any assumptions. Deep should confirm

I am not clear about the problem. OpenOSOSnap is only set here - https://github.com/couchbase/indexing/blob/master/secondary/indexer/stream_state.go#L1840. If buildTs is zero(i.e. there are no mutations), this code shouldn't get executed unless DCP is sending OSO Snapshot (which would be unexpected with 0 mutations).

This is a more generic problem. OSO happens to expose it. E.g. the same case can happen with a zero buildTs and a non snap aligned flushTs for non-OSO mode. Need to think of a more generic solution.

In this patch i have moved flushTs.IsSnapAligned check prior to buildTs.IsZero check, would that not address the issue?

A zero buildTs is good for build completion even in OSO mode. A better check would be to make sure that buildTs is zero as well as flushTs has no snap markers/mutations. Otherwise, zero buildTs has no significance and can be ignored.

I think we can actually simplify this by getting rid of buildTs.IsZeroTs check completely. If buildTs is zero, the check below will be sufficient - ts.GreaterThanEqual(buildInfo.buildTs).
