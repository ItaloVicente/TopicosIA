DESCRIPTION:

MB-31109: Make ip:port binding on projector and indexer more lenient

If the cluster is configured to use ipv4, allow GSI processes
to come up successfully even if they cannot bind to ipv6:port.

Similarly, if the cluster is configured to use ipv6, allow GSI
processes to come up successfully even if they cannot bind to
ipv4:port.

Note that the GSI clients will use the node names from cluster
info cache. And the cluster configuration change with respect
to ipv4/ipv6 protocol stack is not supported if the cluser
node names are based on the ip addresses.

Also note that the server listens only on one of the protocol
stacks, either ipv4 or ipv6. Client also has to connect on
the same protocol stack - to avoid connection failures.
