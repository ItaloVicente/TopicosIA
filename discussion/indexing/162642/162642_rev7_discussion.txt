Line:192, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Q: If there are multiple packets being received in less interval than r.syncBatchInterval, then multiple messages will be sent to syncSendCh.

syncSendCh is blocking channel, this can lead to blocking of this go routine for syncWorker. Is this okay? 

I believe, in case of continuous mutations, syncWorker can become a bottleneck, isn't it?

Line:199, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Q: Do we need to do maybbeSendSync on stream info msg ?

This change is ready for review.
Line:192, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Yes. syncSendCh can become blocking which is the reason why I added "default" block so that we do not block on the code.

Line:199, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> StreamInfo messages happen when there is a connection error on dataport. As no mutation is being processed in this code path, it is ok to ignore maybeSendSync for this case

Line:430, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Does ticker.Stop() need to be called here? How will the ticker get stopped if the stream reader shuts down?

Line:430, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> As we return from this method, ticker gets garbaged collected. That said, I see your point - After we return from this method, it is not a good idea to block the timer resources until GC triggers. I will fix the patch. Thanks for catching this
