DESCRIPTION:

MB-31956 Update protobuf requests to be keyspace aware

A new member called `keyspace` is introduced in the collection
aware requests. Prior to v7.0, all the book-keeping at projector
is maintained at bucket level. From v7.0, the book-keeping will
be maintained at keyspace level. E.g., all engines in a feed will
now map to keyspace rather than bucket. The keyspace name is a
string that will be choosen by indexer (E.g., for MAINT_STREAM_TOPIC,
keyspace name can be bucket name and for INIT_STREAM_TOPIC, it can
be a combination of bucket, scope and collection names)

This keyspace member is introduced at two places:

a) In TsVbuuid -> Any request that contains TsVbuuid will implicitly
contain the keyspace name
b) As Keyspace message for AddInstances and DelBuckets requests. These
request do not contain any timestamps. So, a bucket to keyspace mapping
is additionally added to these two requests
