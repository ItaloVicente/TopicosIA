DESCRIPTION:

MB-31956 Update protobuf requests to be keyspace aware

A new member called `keyspaceIds` is introduced in the collection
aware requests. Prior to v7.0, all the book-keeping at projector
is maintained at bucket level. From v7.0, the book-keeping will
be maintained at keyspaceId level. E.g., all engines in a feed will
now map to keyspaceId rather than bucket. KeyspaceId is used to
determine which mutations are streamed from KV. If keyspaceIds is nil or
keyspaceId is bucket name, then mutations are streamed from the entire bucket
(i.e. from all the collections in the bucket). Otherwise, mutations
are streamed for the collections belonging to the instances mapped to
the keyspaceId

The keyspaceId will be choosen by indexer (E.g., for MAINT_STREAM_TOPIC,
keyspace name can be bucket name and for INIT_STREAM_TOPIC, it can
be a combination of bucket, scope and collection names)

The keyspaceId member is introduced for all the requests that update
the book-keeping at projector

Line:988, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.go -> This mapping doesn't look correct. There can be multiple keyspaceIds corresponding to one bucket. The map in its current form cannot contain that. How is this mapping going to be useful?

Line:144, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> this api will also need the keyspaceId

Line:988, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.go -> Actually this should be fine as only one keyspace per bucket is allowed in the request. It would be good to log/return proper error about what the validation failure is.

Line:51, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> I think the upstream(dcp) should still be started based on the reqTs rather than the collection name in the instances. reqTs will need to have collectionId. If present, the dcp stream can be started for a collection otherwise at bucket level. Instances get added based on bucket<>keyspaceId mapping.

Line:988, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.go -> Done. This method now returns ErrorInvalidKeyspaceIdMap for an invalid request

Line:51, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> Done. Added ScopeID and an array of collectionIDs as a part of reqTs to make it extensible. Indexer can only use CollectionID

Line:144, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> Done
