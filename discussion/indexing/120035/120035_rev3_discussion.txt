DESCRIPTION:

MB-31956 Update protobuf requests to be keyspace aware

A new member called `keyspace` is introduced in the collection
aware requests. Prior to v7.0, all the book-keeping at projector
is maintained at bucket level. From v7.0, the book-keeping will
be maintained at keyspace level. E.g., all engines in a feed will
now map to keyspace rather than bucket. The keyspace name is a
string that will be choosen by indexer (E.g., for MAINT_STREAM_TOPIC,
keyspace name can be bucket name and for INIT_STREAM_TOPIC, it can
be a combination of bucket, scope and collection names)

This keyspace member is introduced for all the requests that update
the book-keeping at projector

Line:56, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> manifestUID would have to be part of the TsVbuuid. It can be different for each vb as it gets transmitted asynchronously from DCP.

Line:68, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> why is keyspaces required in the response?

Line:77, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> why is keyspaces required in the response?

Line:88, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> manifestUID needs to change.

Line:111, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> manifestUID needs to change.

Line:129, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> If there are 5 instance on same bucket "b1" but different collections, how will the keyspace mapping help to identify which instance goes where?

Line:55, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> In CC, reqTimestamps no longer need to be per bucket. For INIT_STREAM, these would be per "collection" i.e. bucket can be same. The Keyspaces with bucket to keyspace mapping doesn't capture this. Keyspaces can be just a []string. Though, it would almost certainly be one reqTs per request, but the API needs to be clear.

Line:68, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> Projector adminport communication is based on request response model. The sender already knows what it requested for. We can keep the keyspaces, need to change the format similar to MTR.

Line:129, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> In CC, for INIT_STREAM, for the same bucket, projector can be having multiple feeds (for multiple collections). With multiple keyspaces, the usage of this API becomes ambiguous. This API should be restricted to use only one keyspace.

Line:162, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> As mentioned in above comments, Keyspace can just be a string. Keyspace should ideally be named as KeyspaceId(better would have been StreamId, as its purpose for stream management, it doesn't represent anything. But as DCP is using StreamId for a different purpose already, lets not use that).

Line:55, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> Changed the datatype of keyspaces field to [[strings. Renamed keyspaces to keyspaceIds. Also, added Validate() method for each request that validates the mapping between bucket to keyspaceId

Line:68, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> Done

Line:129, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> Done

Line:162, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> Renamed keyspaces to keyspaceIds

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:68, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> If keyspace is not added here, then there is no way to know for which collection this response is from response it-self. At indexer we may have to get the bucket mapping from the request and then figure out the corresponding response.

To simplify this, I added 'keyspaces' to response as well. That way response would become self contained.

An easy way to do this is to add a 'keyspace' string to TsVbuuid. That way, except for DeleteBuckets, AddInstancesRequest, there won't be any need to add an explicit 'keyspaces' field. However, In that case, each request has to be handled separately.

By adding Keyspaces to all the requests and response, all the requests can be handled the same way. Hence I choose this approach

Line:129, secondary/protobuf/projector/projector.proto -> They all go to the keyspace defined for the bucket i.e. the keyspace name as chosen by indexer. For one bucket, not more than one keyspace can exist in the request. 

This limitation had to be enforced due to the way we handle MAINT_STREAM requests.
