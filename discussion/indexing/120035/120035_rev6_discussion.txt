DESCRIPTION:

MB-31956 Update protobuf requests to be keyspace aware

A new member called `keyspaceIds` is introduced in the collection
aware requests. Prior to v7.0, all the book-keeping at projector
is maintained at bucket level. From v7.0, the book-keeping will
be maintained at keyspaceId level. E.g., all engines in a feed will
now map to keyspaceId rather than bucket. KeyspaceId is used to
maintain book-keeping at projector

The keyspaceId will be choosen by indexer (E.g., for MAINT_STREAM_TOPIC,
keyspace name can be bucket name and for INIT_STREAM_TOPIC, it can
be a combination of bucket, scope and collection names)

The keyspaceId member is introduced for all the requests that update
the book-keeping at projector
