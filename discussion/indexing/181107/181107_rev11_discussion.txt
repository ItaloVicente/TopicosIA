DESCRIPTION:

MB-52455: Avoid double counting during indexer restart

* To account for metered units on recovery we need two stat values
* 1. Number of Write Units that were last billed to user
* 2. Number of Write Units needed to build the snapshot from which
*   we recover from
* We get (1) by persisting the WriteUnits to file whenever we
*   report the billed units in metering endpoint handler to control
*   control plane. As the data is less numBucketsPerNode * 8bytes
*   this persistence should be fine
* We get (2) by persisting the WriteUnits to build a snapshot in the
*   as a stat while persisting the snapshot and we recover the same
*   on snapshot recovery
* If 1 > 2 -> We will refund user as will be streaming the data
*   from last recovered snapshot
* If 1 < 2 -> We will bill user as we are recovering ahead of what
*   billed to user
