DESCRIPTION:

MB-52455: Avoid double counting during indexer restart

* To account for metered units on recovery we need two stat values
* 1. Number of Write Units that were last billed to user
* 2. Number of Write Units needed to build the snapshot from which
*    we recover from
* 3. We get (1) by persisting the WriteUnits to file whenever we
*    report the billed units in metering endpoint handler to control
*    control plane. As the data is less numBucketsPerNode * 8bytes
*    this persistence should be fine
* 4. We get (2) by persisting the WriteUnits to build a snapshot in the
*    as a stat while persisting the snapshot and we recover the same
*    on snapshot recovery
* 5. If 1 > 2 -> We will refund user as will be streaming the data
*    from last recovered snapshot
* 6. If 1 < 2 -> We will bill user as we are recovering ahead of what
*    billed to user
