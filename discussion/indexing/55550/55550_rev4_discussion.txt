DESCRIPTION:

MB-16154: Create Breakpad Minidump file upon fatal forestdb error

Make use of the new SetFatalErrorCallback() forestdb API to trigger
the creation of a Breakpad minidump when forestdb encounters a fatal
error.

Implemented by using breakpad_wrapper shared library which exposes a
simple C API to Breakpad (C++). This allows Golang (specifically indexer)
to setup Breakpad and manually trigger the creation of Minidumps. This
nterface is then wired up with the forestdb SetFatalErrorCallback() API
such that we register Breakpads' WriteMinidump() function as the fatal
error callback.

Minidump files will be written to the path specified by the
'minidumpDir' argument, or the storageDir if minidumpDir is not
specified.

Note: We *cannot* use Breakpad's handling of fatal errors as Golang
      gets very upset if other code attempts to change the signal
      handlers for SEGV, SIGBUS or SIGFPE - which is exactly what
      Breakpad will do if configured to handle fatal signals.

Line:62, secondary/cmd/indexer/main.go -> This doesn't look right - why is the method called indexer.Initialize()? this isn't very clear what this is for.

Line:63, secondary/cmd/indexer/main.go -> Same here - I think we should revert the rename.

Line:62, secondary/cmd/indexer/main.go -> Because the breakpad.go has been moved to indexer dir. Hence the package name is indexer and not breakpad anymore. We do not want to have a new dir just for breakpad file. This is building fine and works as expected.

Line:62, secondary/cmd/indexer/main.go -> I think you're missing my point. 

"indexer.Initialize" doesn't describe what this function does (similary below). 

If you want to move it into a generic package then the functions need to be renamed to describe what they do - previously the package name provided that description.

For example name them BreakpadInitialize() & BreakpadGetWriteMinidumpAsUintptr().
