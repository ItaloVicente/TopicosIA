DESCRIPTION:

MB-14377: hybrid algorithm to pick optimal index for scan.

- client will detect equivalent index and load-balance based on the
  elapsed time on indexer node.
- in case, of failures, the load-balancing logic will fall back to
  round-robin mode so that the failed node doesn't get picked all the
  time.

in case of indexer node failures, the indexer list on the client side
will eventually be updated when it receives the notification from
ns_server.

Line:361, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> when retry == 0, pickOptimal may pick a replica already.   What if the replica is the one that is being down, and you have to pick the orignal?

Line:361, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> The algorithm of pickOptimal is based on load. Only correlation we can establish between pickOptimal and round-robin is by maintaining a sorted list of replicas. Even then, with concurrent requests, the list might keep changing when GsiClient is shared. So it complicates the logic further.

Btw, the list of replicas include the original as well. Ref: line no 283

Thanks,
