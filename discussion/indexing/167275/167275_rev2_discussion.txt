DESCRIPTION:

MB-49501 Part 5 (7.1.0 1861): Log long heartbeats; reduce dump frequency

1. HealthCheck(): Log if it's been >= 2.1 seconds since prior call, as
   heartbeat interval is 2 seconds and anything longer than that will
   count as a missed heartbeat in ns_server.

2. isSafeLogDetails(): Reduce frequency of logging index status dump
   from at most every 5 minutes to at most every 30 minutes, as if an
   Autofailover attempt is deemed unsafe, ns_server will keep retrying
   it every 2 seconds (empirical observation from MB-49356 logs).

3. Add mutexes for the time tracking variables for both of the above.
   While these don't expect to be called more than once every 2 seconds,
   and ns_server probably does not make a new call until the prior one
   has returned, we should not depend on that behavior. If the node is
   overloaded and multiple calls are made they could get stacked up and
   run in parallel on different cores, as each call is in its own
   goroutine.
