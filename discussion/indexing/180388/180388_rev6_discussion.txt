DESCRIPTION:

MB-52930 Do asyncronous recovery at lifecycle manager

Currently, lifecycle manager calls OnIndexRecover on cluster
manager and waits till response is received. This can potentially
block lifecycle manager for a long time if index recovery process
is slow.

To avoid this scenario, indexer will return success to cluster
manager after recovery has started. After recovery is completed,
indexer will send a message to cluster manager asking to update
the index state. Cluster manager will coordinate with lifecycle
manager and updates the index state to "INDEX_STATE_RECOVERED".

On a failed recovery, indexer will send a message to cluster
manager asking to delete the index instance from topology. On
the caller side, shardRebalancer will wait for the index state
to move to INDEX_STATE_RECOVERED. If recovery fails, then instance
would be deleted from the topology (as index state would be
treated as INDEX_STATE_NIL), caller will abort the wait and fail
the rebalance
