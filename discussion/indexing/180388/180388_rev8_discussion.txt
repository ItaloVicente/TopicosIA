DESCRIPTION:

MB-52930 Do asyncronous recovery at lifecycle manager

Currently, lifecycle manager calls OnIndexRecover on cluster
manager and waits till response is received. This can potentially
block lifecycle manager for a long time if index recovery process
is slow.

To avoid this scenario, indexer will return success to cluster
manager after recovery has started. After recovery is completed,
indexer will send a message to cluster manager asking to update
the index state. Cluster manager will coordinate with lifecycle
manager and updates the index state to "INDEX_STATE_RECOVERED".

On a failed recovery, indexer will send a message to cluster
manager asking to delete the index instance from topology. On
the caller side, shardRebalancer will wait for the index state
to move to INDEX_STATE_RECOVERED. If recovery fails, then instance
would be deleted from the topology (as index state would be
treated as INDEX_STATE_NIL), caller will abort the wait and fail
the rebalance

Line:9054, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> It may be better to create a new message/function on the lines of MsgClustMgrCleanupPartition. CLUST_MGR_UPDATE_TOPOLOGY_FOR_INDEX has gotten a bit crowded. We can keep it for updating an index instance only.

Line:9054, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Got it. I see idx.cleanupIndexMetada() function which is expected to do the exact same thing - Cleanup index instance from metadata. I have replaced this "updateMetaInfoForIndexInst" with cleanupIndexMetadata. 

Thanks for pointing this issue. I was conscious of the presence of cleanupIndexMetadata
