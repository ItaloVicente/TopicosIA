Stale cinfo data is resulting in inavlid VBucket error in repairStream
and hence scans are timing out during rebalance.

Line:1805, secondary/projector/feed.go -> Why 'return'? Can we not fall through?

Line:1805, secondary/projector/feed.go -> yes. We can probably log a warn here and proceed further as we are fetching cluster info cache. If things were to fail again, they will fail later

Line:1805, secondary/projector/feed.go -> I don't see any use in continuing the execution as getTerseBucket failed to execute here and vBucketMap is still stale here.
On this error we are just taking the chance to update the bucket list and the terse bucket for all the buckets.
If the bucket we are looking for got deleted in this time we are just updating the cache here so 
i think we can return here and caller can take necessary action.

Line:1805, secondary/projector/feed.go -> Will let it continue and skip the return here. If the bucket is deleted next function will fail anyway and continuing might help in transient error. Will remove this return statement.
