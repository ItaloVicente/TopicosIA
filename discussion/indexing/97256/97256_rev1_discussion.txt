Line:68, secondary/dcp/conn_pool.go -> Question: Don't we need time out for requests to memcached post auth success?

Line:68, secondary/dcp/conn_pool.go -> I was thinking it can be taken up on need basis. Otherwise, for stream connections, we will have to set timeout to “(2 * dcp_noop_interval) + delta”, and reset it to newer value every time we get some message from memcached. Anyways, it is possible that set_noop_interval takes care of it. But I haven't checked for it.

For other connection types (i.e. non stream connections) (I don’t know list of all connection types), we will have to figure out similar behavior.

Ideally, we expect memcached to respond to all the requests, and the timeout is only a "first line of defense" until the original issue is resolved (as mentioned by John in email with subject MB-29982).

I think this change should be sufficient for now. As 5.1.2 has a smaller test cycle, lets not change too many code paths as these timeouts are not easy to test. We can file an improvement to address other code paths.
