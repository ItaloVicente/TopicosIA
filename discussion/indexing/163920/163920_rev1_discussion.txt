DESCRIPTION:

MB-48730 Rework DDLServiceMgr post-Rebalance processing

When a Rebalance finishes it reports to ns_server that it is done, but it was
still doing background cleanups under go notifyRebalanceDone(), one part of
which would get and hold the ddl_service_manager.go global gDDLServiceMgrLck
mutex while doing possibly extensive cleanup, including deleting old DDL tokens
from metakv. This was the root cause of the current bug as the following
Rebalance timed out attemping to lock this same mutex in stopDDLProcessing()'s
call to getDDLServiceMgr().

The async cleanup code had become disorganized after years of miscellaneous
updates. This fix reorganizes it and eliminates the need for it to hold the
problem mutex. It also consolidates token cleanup under a single goroutine and
changes write locks to read locks in a few places, including in the related
file sched_index_creator.go, and it allows DDL to begin processing again
sooner without waiting for async cleanups. DDL processing was held blocked in
the old code because the token cleanups did not used to check the allowDDL flag
and just forged ahead, but now they check it and token cleanup is no longer
done in the foreground of Rebalance cleanup after this fix either.
