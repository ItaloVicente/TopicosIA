DESCRIPTION:

MB-37671 : Allow specifying secure port in query

Currently we dont allow user to specify the secure port numbers in the
query for Move or Create index. After this change we should be able to
give secure ports. When Encryption is enabled query can contain secure
ports. If Encryption level is Strict i.e. we disable NonSSLPorts query
should only contain secure ports non-secure ports will not be allowed in
the query. This patch will change the output of getIndexStatus too the
node names will contain secure ports when the encryption is enabled.

Line:2859, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> Q: Why this assignment is needed? Especially when we are comparing dest with both maddr and meaddr ?

May be this logic can be simplified.

Line:2041, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> Q: all other occurrences of calls to security.EncryptPortFromAddr() in this file are conditional . i.e. they happen only when the encryption is enabled. But not here, why ?

Line:731, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> Q: Do we need to call cinfo.GetServiceAddress with useEncryptedPortMap = true, right ?

Line:2859, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> So in the below if condition i check if dest is either maddr or meaddr. If encryption is enabled and if we disable non ssl ports both maddr and meaadr point to encrypted address, that way we allow only encrypted addressed . If Encryption is not enabled both meaddr and maddr point to un-encrypted address that way we only allow un-encrypted addresses. If Encryption is enabled but its not Strict we allow both encrypted and un-encrypted ones. 

Yes that logic looks complicated. Let me think if i can simplify it.

Line:2041, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> EncryptPortFromAddr uses EncryptPost which is conditional as in

func EncryptPort(host string, port string) string {

	if EncryptionRequired(host, port) {
		mapping := GetEncryptPortMapping()
		for port1, port2 := range mapping {
			if port == port1 {
				return port2
			}
		}
	}

	return port
}

Other places i am setting some other variables too based on this check.

Line:731, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> Yes as addr is used for REST calls in getLocalIndexMetadataForNode and getStatsForNode. I thought when encryption is enabled we might need the encrypted ports.
