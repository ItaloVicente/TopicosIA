DESCRIPTION:

MB-32633: Add new index stats for array index

New stats added are:
- num_docids_indexed: Number of docids that are currently indexed
- avg_array_length: Average number of items in each array

New field in IndexStats to track num_docids_indexed. This is set
during Slice.setCommittedCount which generally happens during new
snapshot creation. The main and back store items count is used for
primary and secondary indexes respectively.

For MOI's NodeTable, expose ItemsCount as the sum of fastHTCount
and slowHTCount. Calculate back store's total items count by
summing across workers.

Getting info from forestdb can fail, so avoid updating the stats
in such cases.

avg_array_length is computed as a ratio of items_count and
num_docids_indexed. For non-array and primary indexes, this stat
is not applicable and defaults to -1.
