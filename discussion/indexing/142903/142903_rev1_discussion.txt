DESCRIPTION:

MB-43517 Set UserAgent in request headers to ns_server

BP of MB-39210 to 6.5.2

Before setting the UserAgent in request header, the request from
indexer would get logged as (in http_access_internal.log):

127.0.0.1 - @index-cbauth [04/May/2020:05:39:18 -0700]
            "GET /pools/default/buckets/other-3/collections HTTP/1.1"
            200 98 - "Go-http-client/1.1" 1

The User-agent value mentions "Go-http-client/1.1" which does not convey
any valuable information

With this patch, the request from indexer would get logged as

127.0.0.1 - @index-cbauth [04/May/2020:05:39:18 -0700]
            "GET /pools/default/buckets/other-3/collections HTTP/1.1"
            200 98 - "Go-http-client/1.1-indexer-RetrievePlanFromCluster" 1

This would help us to associate a request with it's corresponding client on indexer
facilitating easy debugging
