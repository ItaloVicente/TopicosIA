DESCRIPTION:

MB-52382 (7.1.2 3365) Fix topology change orphaned token clean-up

Fix rebalance_service_manager.go getTransferTokenOwner()
to return the correct owner for TransferTokenAccepted and
TransferTokenRefused, which is Master. Previously this was
incorrectly returning Dest, which meant orphaned TTAccepted
TTs might not get cleaned up, causing the next rebalance to
immediately begin processing them. This could then further
cause a collision between those rogue TT builds and newly
published TTs for the same keyspace, triggering Rebalance
failure with "Build Already In Progress" for that keyspace.
