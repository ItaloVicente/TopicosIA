DESCRIPTION:

MB-32820 Allocate append buffer memory based on numIndexes

For every mutation projector receives, the KeyVersions struct is
updated for all the indexes belonging to the bucket. As per the
current logic, we allocate for only 4 entries in KeyVersions slices
and append() method expands the slices whenever it sees lack of size

This approach generates more garbage as append() allocates a fresh
chunk of memory every time it has to expand. This patch addresses this
problem by allocating the size of slices equal to the number of indexes
belonging to the bucket. This helps to reduce the re-allocs and therefore
garbage generetad.

Results:
Setup: 20M docs, 20 indexes being build simultaneously. Small document size,
small key size

Without this patch: Index build time: 910 sec, Peak RSS: 1.09g, Garbage geenrated: 116g
With this patch:    Index build time: 858 sec, Peak RSS:  921M, Garbage generated:  52g
