DESCRIPTION:

MB-32033 Do collection aware stream requests from projector

For all collection aware dcp feed's, projector will open streams
for the scope/collections specified in the request timestamps. If
no scopeId/collectionIds are specified i.e. scopeId is empty and
collectionIds is nil, projector will open streams for the entire bucket

Line:164, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> is there any benefit of using interface{} rather than []string for collectionIds?

Line:164, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> I have done this to keep the API uniform across all methods i.e. either use []strings at upr.go, dcp_feed.go or use interface{} while requesting for stream.

If collectionIds are sent as []string, then while processing the messages (i.e. for ufCmdRequestStream in upr.go, dfCmdRequestStream in dcp_feed.go), we need to check if the slice is nil or not. Only if it is not nil, we can reflect it to slice of strings and pass it further. To avoid these nil checks, I choose to pass collectionIds as interface{} and do the nil check finally at dcp_feed.go

Line:164, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> It should be fine to use []string in all places. Type assertion works on the type. nil check can still be done in the last function where it is being used. Other functions can just keep passing it.

Line:164, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Thanks for pointing this Deep. I mis-understood type assertion on nil values before. I now see that it should be fine to use []string.
