DESCRIPTION:

MB-53361 updating go.mod

adding relevant dependencies for indexing in go.mod
file is generated using `go mod tidy`

repos that are available in goproj are a part of replace
this makes sure we are using the latest code for all dependencies

all require dependencies are indexer dependencies.
we directly use them as a part of the indexer

all indirect dependencies are "dependencies of our dependents"
go uses this to create module graphs

CMake now uses GoModBuild to update dependencies in mod file
this happens only during the build phase

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> We were intermittently seeing some build failures on CI machine. Was this due to this patch? If so, what was the reason for the build failures?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> There were 2 failures which are now resolved. Build failure was caused because the binaries (projector, cbindex, etc) did not have correct dependencies. This was fixed by adding them to DEPS in CMakeLists.txt. There was failure in finding go path in the CI. This happened as we changed the GOVERSION to 1.18 (removing the minor version). build does not download the go version for this. a temporary fixed has been pushed to CI with a separate permanent fix in review
