User must correlate the system events with getIndexStatus output to get details other than InstanceID and DefinitionID.

Line:41, secondary/logging/systemevent/system_event.go -> Can you please define these events in comments for future reference? E.g., at what phase, we consider index to be in BUILDING state? From the code, I see that it is after MTR is sent to projector - It would be good to capture such details in the comments

Line:1496, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> a. Missing module?

b. If indexer crashes after State is updated to CREATED, then the index will be moved to ready state during bootstrap - In that case, this logic will not be hit but the index will be created? Do you plan to handle that scenario?

Line:3103, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> Same as above

Line:41, secondary/logging/systemevent/system_event.go -> Ack

Line:1496, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> Module is just something i added in extra attributes. There is no expectation from ns_server. Earlier i was having subcomponent as Indexer:Settings and GSIClient:ClientSetting etc.. I thought i will be easy for a script to parse it if we have the subcomponent fixed to Indexer, Projector and GSIClient. Then for the internals in these i thought having custom Module key in extra attr will help.

So it's like events should be grouped like Component:SubCompoent:Module if module is absent script can treat it as empty and have a group like that. 

I will handle the case where crash after creation in the next patch. I saw that in the code but could decide if we needed an event there. But looks like we need it.

Line:3103, secondary/manager/lifecycle.go -> Ack
