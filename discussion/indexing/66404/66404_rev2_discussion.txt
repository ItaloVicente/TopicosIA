Line:74, secondary/indexer/array.go -> This flag looks like a little hackup code. Ideally we do not need this flag.
Instead, the caller should make sure that this doesn't happen.

Line:504, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> This block of code is redundant in the below section. 
This can be cleaned up by defining a function:

tmpBuf := getArrayBuf(oldKey)

Based on the condition, it can allocate the buffer. Also, ArrayIndexItems() does not require a checkSize flag as this function makes sure that bufsize is properly set.

Line:504, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> In case of composite index, it is hard to predict how much buffer is needed. 2x the size of old key could be more or less. We depend on dynamic array size allocation of append in ArrayIndexItems()
