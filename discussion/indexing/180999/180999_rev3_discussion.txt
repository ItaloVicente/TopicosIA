DESCRIPTION:

MB-53977 Handle shard locking and unlocking during shard rebalance

Indexer will lock or unlock shard based on the following rules:

a. Lock shard before transfer. Unlock on failure of transfer.
   On successful transfer, indexer will call DestroyShardId which
   will take care of unlocking shard (Unlock is not required
   when destroying shard)

b. Lock shard after successful Restore. On successful recovery
   indexer will unlock the shard. If rebalance fails before
   transfer token moves to Commit phase, the shard is destroyed
   and unlock is not required in this case. If rebalance fails
   after a token with state ShardTokenDropOnSource is posted,
   indexer will unlock the shards on destination and cleans up
   the shard on source. Otherwise, it will clean up the shards
   on source and unlocks the shards on destination
