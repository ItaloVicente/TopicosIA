MB-35545: Improve overall error handling in TransformRoute

skipped documents.

Maintain IndexEvaluator stat for number of items skipped.
Report the skipped document count in console logs.

Line:472, secondary/projector/worker.go -> we should also log the document id for easy troubleshooting.

Line:322, secondary/protobuf/projector/index.go -> Isn't it better to have a single panic handler in TransformRoute rather than in each function?

Line:322, secondary/protobuf/projector/index.go -> Logically TransforRoute can be divided into two parts, (1) processing of the mutation (2) populating data to send to the endpoint. 

If panic is seen in part 1, it can be due to shape of the specific document. So, this panic has to be handled explicitly and part 2 has to be executed, which will force upsert delete. Thats why single panic handler at the top of TransformRoute won't work as we want to force upsert delete on panic in part 1. 

I have introduced panic handler in part 2 (i.e. populateData) as panic here was being handled before my code change and I did not want to regress from the existing behaviour. Anyways, the panic in part 2 is very unlikely as actual processing on data does not happen in this part.
