DESCRIPTION:

MB-29564: Create a sync pool per query connection

For each new query connection, provide a callback to allocate a connection context.
The connection context is shared across all query requests coming through the same
connection, but there is a separate context per connection.

In each connection context, there is a bytes buffer pool (sync.pool) that can
be used for allocation for temporary memory.   Since the sync.pool is not
shared across connection, there is no contention from different requests.
The memory in sync.pool is freed up upon GC.
