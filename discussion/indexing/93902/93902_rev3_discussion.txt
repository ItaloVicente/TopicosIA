DESCRIPTION:

MB-29564: Create a sync pool per query connection

For each new query connection, provide a callback to allocate a
connection context.  The connection context is shared across all
query requests coming through the same connection, but there is
a separate context per connection.

In each connection context, there is a bytes buffer pool
(sync.pool) that can be used for allocation for temporary memory.
Since the sync.pool is not shared across connection and each
connection can only serves one request at a time, there is no
contention from different requests.  The memory in sync.pool is
freed up upon GC.
