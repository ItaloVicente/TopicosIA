DESCRIPTION:

MB-32273 Send buffer ack periodically

Projector can take long time to respond when downstream data path is
blocked. This can lead to DCP closing the connection

This patch addresses this problem by seding a buffer ack on a time bound
basis in-addition to the current size based logic

Line:775, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Q: Do we need to initialise it to Time.Now() when the connection first gets established?

Line:775, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> We should not hard code things as a general guideline

Line:52, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> My bad. This gets initialised in NewDcpFeed(). Not sure how I missed it in this patch.

Line:775, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> I have made this period a constant. I think this does not require to be a configuration parameter as the current interval (20sec) is sufficient.

Line:775, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> My bad. This gets initialised in NewDcpFeed(). Not sure how I missed it in this patch.
