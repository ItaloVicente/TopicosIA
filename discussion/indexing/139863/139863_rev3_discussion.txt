DESCRIPTION:

MB-32052 Do not copy vbuuid for every index instance during snapshotting

With large number of indexes, copying tsVbuuid for every index instance
becomes a costly operation. As a snapshot is immutable in nature, the
tsVbuuid in snapshot will not be changed. Hence, it is safe to use the
same tsVbuuid instance for all the snapshots
