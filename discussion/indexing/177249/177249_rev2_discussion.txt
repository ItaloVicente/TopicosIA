DESCRIPTION:

MB-52877 (7.2.0 1517) Add new Query Elixir interface stubs to tests

Query added new interface stubs for Elixir to some classes GSI
tests mock. We need the same stubs in the tests else they won't
build after the 7.2.0 build where the Query stubs were delivered
(https://review.couchbase.org/c/query/+/176728).
