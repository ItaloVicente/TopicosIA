DESCRIPTION:

MB-31670: Do not restart indexer upon some of the settings change

For below settings, apply the change dynamically without restarting indexer
allow_large_keys
max_seckey_size
max_array_seckey_size

Apply change in buffer size in every slice worker in first mutation
processing after the settings change. Also pass settings as variable
to functions that used global values for size validation

Reduce dependency of global settings variables to just two usages.
Rest of the code dynamically computes setting values based on
updated sys config

Line:49, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> Is it required to init key size config in init()? initStorageSettings call in initFromPersistedState will init it correctly.

Line:296, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> the usage of gKeySzCfg needs to be protected by a lock.

Line:491, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> the usage of gKeySzCfg needs to be protected by a lock.

Line:501, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> the usage of gKeySzCfg needs to be protected by a lock.

Line:49, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> Earlier these global variables were initialized outside of any function. And one of these variables was used in init() of scan coordinator for dependency. 
Right now it is needed as secKeyBufPool and docBufPool are still init'd in init()

Line:296, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> Will do

Line:491, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> Will do

Line:501, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> This method isSecKeyLarge was earlier used in a fast path (newKey call in scan request). Hence I removed dependency on gKeySzCfg in NewSecondaryKey by passing the limit to it as param. 

So isSecKeyLarge is now not used anywhere, so will remove this method.

Line:49, secondary/indexer/index_entry.go -> I think we can consolidate all the buf pools related code in a separate file to make the code cleaner. The init of the new file can take care of doing the necessary init. Also, the key size related stuff can be moved there.

Line:464, secondary/indexer/settings.go -> The accessors of all buf pools need to use locks for synchronization otherwise this update is raceful.

Line:464, secondary/indexer/settings.go -> Do you mean even when we do a Get on these buf pools like secKeyBufPool ?

Line:464, secondary/indexer/settings.go -> yes, if you want to go with the implementation in this patch.
