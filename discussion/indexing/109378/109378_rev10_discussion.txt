DESCRIPTION:

MB-31670: Do not restart indexer upon some of the settings change

For below settings, apply the change dynamically without restarting indexer
allow_large_keys
max_seckey_size
max_array_seckey_size

Apply change in buffer size in every slice worker in first mutation
processing after the settings change. Also pass settings as variable
to functions that used global values for size validation

Remove dependency of global settings variables. All settings are
dynamically computed based on updated sys config.

Line:1168, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Yes I did think of removing this as we restart soon after.

Line:2348, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> I saw a bunch of usages in plasma slice where sysconf was not read locked. For ex: defaultCmdQueueSize() which is also called as part of initWriters(). I think we need to analyze where else read lock is needed for sysconf as a separate task. I will add read lock here before calling getKeySizeConfig()
