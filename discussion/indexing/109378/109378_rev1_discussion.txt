DESCRIPTION:

MB-31670: Do not restart indexer upon some of the settings change

For below settings, apply the change dynamically without restarting indexer
allow_large_keys
max_seckey_size
max_array_seckey_size

Apply change in buffer size in every slice worker in first mutation
processing after the settings change. Also pass settings as variable
to functions that used global values for size validation

Line:25, secondary/indexer/forestdb_iterator.go -> Q: Is this TODO still valid?

Line:268, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> Could be a bool?

Line:377, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> Cosmetic: This could be renamed to getSliceBufferConfig() or something more suitable

Line:379, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> Atomic Load on every insert/delete may be costly. Perhaps a simple load would do.

Line:405, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Cosmetic: Perhaps rename to maybeUpdateAndGetKeyszCfg()

Line:407, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Atomic load for every insert/delete may be costly. Perhaps a simple load?

Line:531, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Similar comments as for fdb, mdb.

Line:163, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> int32 should be enough here, right?

Line:1771, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Is it possible to encapsulate all these globals into a single global struct?

Line:268, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> sync/atomic package does not provide atomic ops on bool datatype

Line:377, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> This not only gets config but updates the buffers if config has changed. Hence used the verb reflecting the purpose of the function

Line:379, secondary/indexer/forestdb_slice_writer.go -> As discussed, this has to be an atomic Load. A simple read causes this go-routine to never observe (theoretically) the write done by another go routine

Line:163, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Done

Line:163, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Done

Line:1770, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Done

Line:1771, secondary/indexer/memdb_slice_impl.go -> Yes, will be taken care of in next patch
