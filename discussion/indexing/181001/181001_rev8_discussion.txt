DESCRIPTION:

MB-54012 Skip slice close and destroy for shard rebalance requests

When an index has to be dropped in shard rebalance algorithm,
the "/dropIndex" REST endpoint is invoked. After this, the
shard rebalancer is going to destroy the shard. Destroying
the shard is required to clean-up the files on the disk of a
shard (Even if all instances of a shard are dropped, plasma
will keep some shard metadata as plasma does not know if
any other index might be sharing the shard).

Also, when DestroyShardID() API is called, plasma closes all
slice instances and then destroys the shard. The slice closing
with "/dropIndex" request happens asynchronously in a go-routine.
Therefore, it is possible that the slice.Close() from dropIndex
request and slice.Close() from DestroyShardID() request are
going to race. Currently, plasma does not support concurrent
slice.Close() methods.

One way to address this problem is to ask plasma to skip closing
the slice when DestroyShardID() is called. But this can still
pose problems as slice.Close() is asynchronous and by the time
DestroyShardID() is called, slice.Close() can still be in progress.

Hence, to address the problem, the dropIndex requests during
shard rebalance algorithm skip the slice.Close() methods. When
DestroyShardID() is called, it will take care of closing the
slice and destroying the shard metadata.
