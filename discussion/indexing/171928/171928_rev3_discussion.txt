File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hi Blair,

Quick question: with this patch, all the indexing files - which did not have any license - will come under BSL license, right?

Just wanted to know the scope of the change. 

Thanks.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> What do you mean by "all the indexing files"? There's 420 files being modified by this change - are there some other ones that are not?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hi Chris, 

Apologies for the confusion. 

What I meant was, last time when BSL related changes were done to "indexing" repo, we had deliberately skipped the source files which did not have any license at the top. With this change, we want to fix that (along with any other changes that are being proposed here). Am I right ?

We are yet to go over the entire changeset. So, not sure if any files are missing from this changeset. Will update here once the review is done.

Thanks.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Ah, got it. Blair can confirm, but I certainly see a number of files here which have entirely new copyright notices being added, so I assume that's the goal.
