DESCRIPTION:

MB-34426: [Backport] Prune additional key positions in partitioned index with ORDER BY

Save the additional projections added by OrderBy processing in RequestBroker.
At the time of gather() (as part of scatter gather for partitioned order-by
processing), when sorted entry is being sent to N1QL, prune the "additional"
projection positions added due to Order-By requirements.

Also, if original index projection is nil, do proceed with analyzeOrderBy
nil projection implies everything need to be projected.

(cherry picked from commit 4e37fa6e963e0278d5585015b666febb791ee309)
