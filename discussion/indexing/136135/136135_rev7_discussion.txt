DESCRIPTION:

MB-41109 Refresh progress stats every 5 sec for load balancing at client

With collections, as large number of indexes will be managed
by indexer, the stats_cache_timeout has been increased to 30 sec.

GSI Client uses the index progress stats to effectively load
balance scans across indexes incase replica indexes are available.

If the stats_cache_timeout is increased to 30 sec, then the GSI
client can not do proper load balancing for a duration of 30 sec.
To mitigate this effect, the progress stats which the GSI client
uses for load balancing will be refreshed every 5 sec irrespective
of stats_cache_timeout value. This period is made configurable
using the setting "indexer.client_stats_refresh_interval"
