I think this logger is going to be much more than just a dedup logger. Probably better to not name it as dedup logger in the code so we don't have to keep renaming it as more capabilities get added.
Line:1959, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> Though it is good to have redundancy, I am not sure if we should log the stats to normal logs on error. With collections, this can make the normal log file much less useful. We should log any error coming from the logger to the normal log file.

Line:1983, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> We should log storage stats in the stats log file as well.

Line:1983, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> As of now, we make use of Stringer function of plasma. So, we get json marshalled stats from storage. To exploit deduplication, we need map[string]interface{}.

This will need changes in storage code as well. (Otherwise, we may end up doing unmarshal / marshal once more). If we are going ahead with storage code change, this has to happen with all 3 storage types.

I think we can take this up as a separate patch - as there are a few things to be figured out.
