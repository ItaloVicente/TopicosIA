DESCRIPTION:

MB-55257: Implement combined average resident percent stat

This stat reports average resident percent including both, mainstore
and backstore

Per index combined_resident_percent is already present, which reports
combined resident percent for an index across mainstore and backstore.
So, a similar named node level stat it added here.
