DESCRIPTION:

MB-46531 Fix four getIndexStatus caching problems

Backport non-ETag fixes from MB-43967 Part 1 to 6.6.3:

These changes are fixes / rewrites of getIndexStatus caching code in
manager/request_handler.go to address the following problems:

1. New data went to disk cache first but not memory cache, leading to
   inefficiencies and possible time travel (serving older data after
   having previously served newer data).

2. Disk cache cleanup deleted entries from memory cache based on older
   information about what indexer nodes are reachable, which could
   incorrectly purge memory cache entries that are newer than the staged
   data the disk persistor is working on.

3. It failed to locally cache latest known status of an unresponsive
   node that was retrieved from another node's cache, so if the other
   node also went down, status would be served from even older cache
   entries.

4. It cached results of the latest getIndexStatus even if they were only
   partial results due to caller filters and/or caller lacking
   permissions, thus purging prior full results from the cache, as only
   one entry is kept locally for each indexer node. The fix is to skip
   caching any partial result for a node. Performance would suffer and
   available info of unresponsive nodes would also be degraded if the
   last thing cached for a now-unresponsive node was only a partial
   result set.
