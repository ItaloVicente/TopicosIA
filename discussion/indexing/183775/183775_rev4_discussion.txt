DESCRIPTION:

MB-52931 Schedule DDL in back-ground on commit failure due to rebalance

A commit failure during rebalance can happen when rebalance
is initiated after prepare is accepted. Rebalance will reset
prepareLock on lifecycle manager in such cases.

Lifecycle manager also checks the value of "RebalanceRunning"
in repo and rejects the commit phase if rebalance is running.
In either case, metadata_provider will take the following
actions:

a. If atleast one node accepts the commit phase, then it means
that a createCommandToken is posted and rebalancer will handle
the index creation/movement as a part of rebalance. In this
case, a commit token is not posted.

b. If none of the indexer nodes accept commit token (i.e. all
of them error out), then if the failure is due to rebalance,
then index posts a schedule token for the index - If the schedule
token does not already exist (i.e. in asyncCreate == false cases)

Before scheduling a commit token, metadata provider will cancel
the prepareLock acquired at lifecycle manager in earlier phases.
