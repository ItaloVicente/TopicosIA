DESCRIPTION:

MB-50659: Implement indexer dataport auth

Backport MB-50322 to 7.0.4

- Dataport server auth can be enabled only for the cluster which
  is fully upgraded to 7.1.0.
- On successful upgade to 7.1.0, already existing connections,
  which were created without auth, will remain as they are.
  Only new connections will require auth.
- By default, dataport server does NOT enforce auth. Auth
  enforcement can be enabled using the config setting.
- Dataport client-server communication is a one-way communication
  where client streams the data to the server. The auth
  implementation adheres to this protocol.

Client:
- Client, on observing cluster version >= 7.1.0, will send AuthRequest
  to the server as the first packet.
- Client does not wait for any response from the server.
- Client will continue to send the stream data to the server.
- In case of auth failure, server will close the connection.
- Client will identify the closed connection and will close the endpoint.
- Indexer should cleanup and restart the stream if endpoint is closed.

Server:
- Server will enforce the auth if cluster version >= 7.1.0.
- In presence of AuthRequest, server will always verify the auth and will
  close the connection if authetication verification fails.
- In absence of AuthRequest, server will allow the connection as long as
  cluster version is < 7.1.0 OR enableAuth setting is "false".
- If cluster version is >= 7.1.0 AND enableAuth is "true", server will
  close the connection in absence of AuthRequest.

Line:573, secondary/common/config.go -> Is there an implication of keeping this as immutable?

Line:573, secondary/common/config.go -> Hi Deep, thanks for pointing this out. Although, even if the flag says it is immutable, indexer does not enforce immutability. The Setting change works well without indexer restart. I had tested this during 7.1 development time. Verified the same on 7.0.4 as well.

Anyways. I have fixed the flag on 7.0.4 now.

Line:573, secondary/common/config.go -> Done. Made it mutable. Opened MB-51709 for 7.1.1, Morpheus. I still analysing the impact.
