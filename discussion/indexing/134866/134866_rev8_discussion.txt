Line:227, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> I think this method gets called as a part of rebalance operation. Is it safe to call transferScheduleToken here. I mean, if ns_server is expecting some sort of response from us with this method and by having transferScheduleTokens here, are we delaying the response?

Line:1488, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> If the only indexer node in the cluster is being failed over and rebalanced out, will this code be hit? If that's the case, then this could lead to a panic

Line:227, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> As discussed offline, I will check about the progress update. Otherwise, ns_server is not waiting for a quick response at this time.

Line:1488, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> Thanks for pointing this out. I don't think ns_server will call this. Let me confirm. But I will still add a safety check.
