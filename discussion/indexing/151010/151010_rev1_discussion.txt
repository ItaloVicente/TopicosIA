DESCRIPTION:

MB-45611 Move common functional test vars and funcs into common_test.go

This patch affects only GSI functional test code. It removes all
existing dependencies between test sets (set##_xyz_test.go) by moving
all vars and funcs used by multiple tests to the shared common_test.go
file that already exists for this purpose. This makes it easy to run
individual sets in isolation, or to skip running one set, by
temporarily moving the unwanted set(s) to a DISABLED/ subdirectory.
Previously this would cause the test build to fail in many cases due
to the cross-test-set dependencies.
