Line:201, secondary/indexer/sched_index_creator.go -> Is crashing here a good idea - How about returning failure message to caller

Line:456, secondary/indexer/sched_index_creator.go -> Do we need to employ any corrective action (or) retry here instead of continue

Line:511, secondary/indexer/sched_index_creator.go -> As these methods are exported, it would be good to have the mutex in this method (or) we can add a comment that these methods require syncronization

Line:201, secondary/indexer/sched_index_creator.go -> As of today, many components crash due to similar errors like DDL service manager, Rebalance service manage etc. So, this won't be a different behaviour.

Having said this, I believe that the message which wasn't meant for scheduled index creator could be meant for some other component and the requester may be left waiting for the response. This can lead to indexer being blocked as well (we don't know all scenarios). So, it is better to keep these crashes in the code. 

If we encounter this in future, we can fix the sender side code.

Line:456, secondary/indexer/sched_index_creator.go -> What kind of corrective action you are thinking of? 

Anyways, similar logic of skipping processing of entries is there in DDL service manger. So, this will be similar behaviour to that of create/delete tokens.

Line:511, secondary/indexer/sched_index_creator.go -> This code is primarily taken from PriorityQueue Example from https://golang.org/pkg/container/heap/.

Thats the reason why these functions have to be exported. 

Anyways, thanks for pointing it out. I will add a comment. :)
