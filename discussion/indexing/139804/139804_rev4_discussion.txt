DESCRIPTION:

MB-32052 Use fine grained locking for accessing waiters in waiterMap

When there are large number of indexes on the node, there exists
a contetion between all the indexes at "updateSnapMapAndNotify"
as this method acquires muSnap lock before doing any operation.
To avoid the contention at this, the waitersMap and indexSnapMap
are updated to become compatabile with CopyOnWrite scheme.

Additionally, the locking scheme to access individual snapshot
waiters has been made fine-grained in nature i.e. each index
instance in waitersMap will have an exclusive lock that should
be taken before reading/writing to the waiters belonging to the
index. This means more than one go-routine can simultaneously
access its waiters as agains the earlier scheme where only one
thread could make progress.

The waitersMap is updated only at one place: handleUpdateIndexInstMap.
When a new instance is added, a new waiter container is added
for that instances. From this time on, till the time the instance
is removed, the instance would refer to the same waiterContainer object.

The lock in the waiter container object protects the list of waiters. In
this design, the list of waiters can change but the mapping between an
index instance and waiterContainer object should never change

Line:1130, secondary/indexer/storage_manager.go -> Minor: Why not initialise a new slice here, like existing code ?

This change is ready for review.
Line:1130, secondary/indexer/storage_manager.go -> There could be some existing waiters in the waiter map already. Hence, using the append based logic

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1130, secondary/indexer/storage_manager.go -> Hey Amit, Sorry, I mis-understood your comment. I now see your point. Will initialise a new waiters slice here.
