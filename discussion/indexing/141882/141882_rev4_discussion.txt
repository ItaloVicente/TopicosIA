DESCRIPTION:

MB-43117 Respond back to outstanding requets in worker channels on close

When worker closes, there can be some outstanding requests remaining in
workerQueue and internalCh. These callers of these requests would wait
forever if no response is sent and hence can lead to indexer hang

Line:270, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> minor - would be better to propagate this as &workerResult to save the extra copies.

Line:270, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> Hey Deep, yes. But this change is not isolated to workerResult itself. The requests are also making a copy. I will address all those changes in a separate patch
