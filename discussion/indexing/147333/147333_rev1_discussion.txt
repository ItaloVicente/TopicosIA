Line:537, secondary/projector/worker.go -> As I understand, these transaction documents get populated only in default collection of every bucket. So, we can add more checks here - like validating the collectionID and validating the length of the document etc.

Also, a stat would be good to know how many transactional documents projector is processing.

Line:537, secondary/projector/worker.go -> Minor: Please re-name this to isTxn or some thing like that

Line:537, secondary/projector/worker.go -> Will rename it to isTxn

Line:537, secondary/projector/worker.go -> Regarding the default collection my understanding from the Grahams mail was that they can occur in other collections

Can add length of the value check. I thought _txn prefix and binary checks were sufficient. Just thought of reducing the number of checks as this will happen for every mutation. But binary nature check along with naming convention should be enough i guess.. we can an empty check too if needed.

Quick Ref from Graham'm Mail
"Transactions create ATR records on the bucket._default._default collection by default, but the user may also use any number of custom collections.

The ATR documents start with "_txn:atr-", and are binary docs with zero body length.  However the statement below that they have an _txn xattr isn't correct - I wouldn't use any contents of the doc as a signal, as they may change in future - the binary/empty nature combined with the naming seems sufficient?
 
Ultimately the goal is to have those ATR documents end up in system collection(s) that will be invisible to non-transaction components, but until that time filtering does seem a sensible interim solution."

Line:537, secondary/projector/worker.go -> Ok. Sounds good. I think in that case, we should change the prefix transactionMutationPrefix to "_txn:atr-" instead of just "_txn"

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:537, secondary/projector/worker.go -> Checked with Graham on the bug the prefix "_txn:" seems to be right as it will skip both client records and ATR.

Will add the stat to count the skipped mutations in another patch.
