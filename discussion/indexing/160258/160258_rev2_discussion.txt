DESCRIPTION:

MB-48191 Fix storageMgr.deepCloneIndexSnapshot() for Smart Batching

storageMgr.deepCloneIndexSnapshot() had aliased "prune everything" to
"prune nothing," and the actual behavior for both was to prune nothing.
The prune everything case was always avoided by the historical Rebalance
algorithhm, but the Smart Batching Index Builds During Rebalance feature
needs this case to work correctly, so it exposed this latent bug.

The fix is to disambiguate the arguments and handling so that the two
cases can be distinguished and handled correctly.
