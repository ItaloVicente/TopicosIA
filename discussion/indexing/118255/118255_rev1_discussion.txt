DESCRIPTION:

MB-36949 robust handling for partial dcp snapshots

if a partial dcp snapshot is followed by multiple complete snapshots before
stream reader has a chance to send the SYNC message to timekeeper,
the information about partial snapshot could be lost. stream reader
will now track this information in DisableAlign flag and send it to
timekeeper with every SYNC message, so that timekeeper can take
necessary action.

Line:436, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> Should this be "|=" (or) can it happen that we receive partial snapshots for some vbuckets and not for others? In that case DisableAlign would be true for some vbuckets and false for others. Then DisableAlign would take the value from last stream worker processed

Line:436, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> That's the reason for keeping it in the "if". Once the flag has been set for any vb, it will remain set regardless.
