DESCRIPTION:

MB-30382 index_slice:  Wait for slice queue to drain before closing slice

When the indexer processes drop index, it flushes the mutations to the
slice and issues drop index. When indexer operates in NO_SNAP mode (due
to large number of mutations in the snapshot or unable keep up with the
drain rate), a new snapshot is not created before the slice.Close() is
called. Every snapshot creation waits for current slice queue to drain.
But in NO_SNAP case, the residue mutations will be processed by the
slice mutation workers while slice.Close() is processed. This leads to
memory used by the storage getting freed while mutation workers try to
insert residue item. It results in a crash.

Fixed MOI and Plasma slices to wait for residue mutations in the slice
queue before performing storage close.
