DESCRIPTION:

MB-54990 Schedule index creation failures in back-ground due to commit failures

If index creation fails during commit phase due to another
concurrent index request, then schedule the index for back-ground
creation.

Client follows the following protocol:

a. If response is received from all watchers (i.e. indexers) and
none of them accepted commit, then client will check if commit
failure is due to rebalance running (or) concurrent index creation

b. If there is atleast one commit failure due to rebalanceRunning,
then client will schedule the index for back-ground creation only
if "indexer.serverless.allowScheduleCreateRebal" is set to true.
Otherwise, the index is not scheduled for back-ground creation.

c. If all the commit failures are due to concurrent index creation,
index will be scheduled for back ground creation.

d. If atleast one node has not responded (due to timeouts or other
issues), then client will check for the presence of create command
token. If create command token exists, then index will not be
scheduled for back-ground creation.

e. If create command token does not exist, then client fail index
creation and respond back with error to the user
