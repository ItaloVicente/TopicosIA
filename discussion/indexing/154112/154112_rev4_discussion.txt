DESCRIPTION:

MB-46348 Use channel based closure for runScatter from feed

The atomic variable "stopScatter" is shared across go-routines.
Even after it is set to "1", it is possible that the reader
go-routine can read "0" and process a mutation. This can lead
to a mutation falling out of snapshot boundary with the
following sequence of events:

a. Feed triggerred cleanupKeyspace and set stopScatter variable
to "1"
b. Feed spawned a go-routine to drain kvdata mutation channel
c. The go-routine drained snapshot message
d. Now, KVData has read a mutation from mutch and this mutation
carries a seqno after the snapshot message
e. If stopScatter varialble value is seen '0', then KVData would
process the mutation instead of ignoring the event

If this mutation reaches indexer, it leads to seqno falling out
of snapshot boundary message. Since there are no syncronisation
points between feed.cleanupKeyspace() and kvdata::runScatter(),
it is possible for the stopScatter to see stale value

To avoid this, use a channel based termination instead of
atomic variable. Golang runtime guarantees happens-before
relation on channels. Therefore, if channel close happens
before reading from the channel, we can safely terminate
the runScatter method without processing any mutations
further
