DESCRIPTION:

MB-46348 Use channel based closure for runScatter from feed

The atomic variable "stopScatter" is shared across go-routines.
Even after it is set to "1", it is possible that the reader
go-routine can read "0" and process a mutation. This can lead
to a mutation falling out of snapshot boundary.

To avoid this, use a channel based termination instead of
atomic variable. Golang runtime guarantees happens-before
relation on channels. Therefore, if channel close happens
before reading from the channel, we can safely terminate
the runScatter method without processing any mutations
further

Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Q: Can you add more details to why mutation processing can lead to out of snapshot boundary seqno processing ? Snap Start and Snap End should be seen on the same match, right ?
