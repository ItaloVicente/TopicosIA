DESCRIPTION:

MB-46348 Use channel based closure for runScatter

The atomic variable "stopScatter" is shared across go-routines.
Even after it is set to "1", it is possible that the reader
go-routine can read "0" and process a mutation. This can lead
to a mutation falling out of snapshot boundary.

To avoid this, use a channel based termination instead of
atomic variable. Golang runtime guarantees happens-before
relation on channels. Therefore, if channel close happens
before reading from the channel, we can safely terminate
the runScatter method without processing any mutations
further
