DESCRIPTION:

MB-52931 Skip updating index metadata if dropped during recovery

If index is dropped during async recovery (either due to
scope/collection drop (or) user issued a drop), then
skip updating the index metadata after async recovery is
done (async recovery happens only during shard rebalance).

Since a deleteCommandToken will be posted, janitor will
take care of cleaning up the index book-keeping
