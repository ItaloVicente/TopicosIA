DESCRIPTION:

WIP MB-48273: Index creation with empty magma bucket is stuck forever.

This is not a magma specific issue. When there are no mutations and DCP_SEQNO_ADVANCE message is missed but MAINT_STREAM has high sequence number (e.g due to creation of collections)
INIT_STREAM for collection is not flushed and hence the initFlushTs is nil. This causes stream merge not to proceed.

Fix: initialize the initFlushTs sequence numbers to all zero vector and try the merge.

Line:2545, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> For mixed mode, I think we will not see this problem. So, we can ignore this code for mixed mode.

Line:2548, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Yes - Retrying every 1ms is a bad idea. I think retrying in this code path is a bad idea because timekeeper will be blocked for so long - making other streams stall.

What we can do is avoid retry - attempt only once at a time. Next time when this method gets called, we can check again. For the specific case we are trying to solve, merging index after few seconds should not matter.

Line:2560, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Do you mean maintFlushTs or minMergeTs?

Line:2560, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> i mean minMergeTs only, since as per earlier code we would have returned when maintFlsushTs != nil but initFlushTs = nil now we are doing fallthrough. So when we access minMergeTs below if it was nil, older code would have already returned and hence no problem but in this due to fallthrough now if minMergeTs if it can be nil in any case that will cause panic. Hence wanted to make sure it will not be nil. As per my understanding it should not be nil as maintFlushTs is not nil, minMergeTs will be set to mostly same value, but just in case if I have missed something hence left the comment so that you and Deep can think over it.
