Line:2778, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> I think it is better to rename this as nodeID

Line:2812, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> Since we are calling this method by holding cinfo lock, I think it is better to rename this method to getSchedCreateTokensNoLock

Line:2830, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> This becomes nested read lock in Cinfo which can lead to a deadlock in the code

Line:2901, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> Probably it is better to rename this as nodeID

Line:2921, secondary/manager/request_handler.go -> Same as above
