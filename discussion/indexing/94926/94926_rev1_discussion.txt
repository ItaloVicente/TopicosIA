Please check size of the files and number of times the file is written based on number of blocks being corrupted to make sure there is not much overhead.

Patch Set 1:

During full functional test run, the fdb file size is ~400 KB and write happens 3 times. Total number of blocks is ~100. 

I know the performance overhead. But as this is unit test code, I kept things simple.

Total amount of time taken to corrupt the file is less than 1 sec (functional test logs don't print timestamp in milliseconds).
