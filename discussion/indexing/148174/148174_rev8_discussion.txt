Line:23, secondary/projector/memmanager/manager.go -> NewMemManager is a better name for the constructor.

This change is ready for review.
Line:23, secondary/projector/memmanager/manager.go -> Hey Amit, Since I am not returning any object from this method nor initialising a new object, I used the naming Init(). This method initialises global memManager method

Line:409, secondary/common/config.go -> Not sure how costly the sigar calls are. It is done every 30 seconds at indexer.

Line:14, secondary/projector/memmanager/collect_stats.go -> we can probably have it in the common package and use it from both projector and indexer, rather than having two copies. feel free to file a ticket to do it later due to time crunch.

Line:409, secondary/common/config.go -> Hey Deep, I profiled 1M of these calls. It took around 13us for 1 call for ProcessFreeMem and ProcessTotalMem functions. CPU gathering and RSS gathering took even less time

I think we need these calls every 5 seconds as I am using these calls to monitor RSS usage of projector in later calls and then try to throttle DCP streams based on projector RSS

Line:14, secondary/projector/memmanager/collect_stats.go -> Sure. I initially tried that but the problem is we need to include sigar dependencies in gometa and cbq-engine CMakelists.txt - otherwise, compilation is failing with sigar.h file not found error. Hence made a separate file. But, I am facing this issue in later patches as well. I will move this to a common implementation after fixing the sigar dependencies issue
