DESCRIPTION:

MB-53297: Fix systemHandler() crashed: send on closed channel

- When security context changes, projector closes the request channel on which adminport server writes requests (Reader is closing the channel)
- This code change closes the channel from writer's side

Line:346, secondary/adminport/server/admin_httpd.go -> Why is this lock required here? What happens if we do not acquire this lock?

Line:346, secondary/adminport/server/admin_httpd.go -> If one request is about to write on channel and another comes after CloseReqch() call, latter one will wait for former’s completion before closing channel.

Line:346, secondary/adminport/server/admin_httpd.go -> Ok. Got that. Thanks! 

Can the race still happen. E.g., Consider the following sequence of events:

a. go-routine-1 reached till line: 344
b. go-routine-2 called ClosedReqCh() and closed the reqCh
c. go-routine-1 wakes up, acquires the lock and tries to write to reqCh which is already closed by go-routine-2

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:346, secondary/adminport/server/admin_httpd.go -> Here, Instead of acquiring the mutex for entire block, can we just acquire mutex to read the closeReqCh state. Once we read the value into a local variable, I do not see a need for lock (Except when updating state to REQCH_DISABLE_CLOSE - For which we can acquire lock one more time and update the state).

This makes sure that we need not acquire lock while sending request and waiting for response. This prevents lock contention for other functions and also keeps the semantics close to earlier implementation.

Line:346, secondary/adminport/server/admin_httpd.go -> Will this serialize request processing of multiple go-routines i.e. now, can one request wait for another?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:346, secondary/adminport/server/admin_httpd.go -> Since we are using one reqCh, they will anyways be serialized. Therefore, ignore my earlier comment.

Since we are using mutex for the entire select block, is closeReqCh still required. Can we not track this with just a boolen. I mean the following:

a. shutdown sets a boolean - closeReqCh to true while holding lock
b. systemHandler will acquire lock and if this boolean is true, it will close reqCh and return

Since the synchronization happens with mutex, I think we should be able to solve with just a boolean
