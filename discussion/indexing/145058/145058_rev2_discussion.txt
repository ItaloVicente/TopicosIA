DESCRIPTION:

MB-42289 Optimise broadcast of bootstrap stats

a. Use "gsiClient" consumer filter when retrieving stats
b. Populate bootstrapStats incrementally - Prepopulating the stats
would require indexer to get the stats for all indexes i.e. even
for indexes which have not been initialised. That is un-necessary

This change is ready for review.
Line:6641, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> If we populate the broadcast stats before entering this loop, then we will have to marshall the stats for indexes that have not been initialised at storage manager/scan coordinator. E.g., if there are 5000 indexes, then even when initialising the first index, we marshal the stats of 5000 indexes. This seems un-necessary waste of time.

With the movement, for the first index, we only get stats for that index. For second index, we get stats for first and second index. 3rd index will have stats for 1,2,3 indexes. This will save some time for us.
