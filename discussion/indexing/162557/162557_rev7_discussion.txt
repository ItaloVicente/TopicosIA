DESCRIPTION:

MB-48553 Change the way flush buffer is invoked

With the new scheme, there will not be any periodic timer.
Rather, timer is invoked on demand. This means that if
there are no mutations, then there will be no timers
waiting to fire leading to less idle time CPU and faster
flush to downstream

Line:434, secondary/dataport/endpoint.go -> Shouldn't we also call flushTick.Stop here? Otherwise the timer will keep firing. Also the next Reset can get called without calling Stop first (For a Timer created with NewTimer, Reset should be invoked only on stopped or expired timers with drained channels.).

Line:434, secondary/dataport/endpoint.go -> I have changed the flushTick from Ticker to Timer. So, flushTick will only be fired once until it is reset. We need not do Stop() here as the timer as already fired and it's channels are drained.

From what I understand, timer internally fires a go-routine to trigger the timer channel. If Reset() is called without Stop(), it is possible that the go-routine can write to timer channel not honouring the Reset. 

For our case, I think we need not explicitly Stop(). The flushTickActive boolean is tracking whether the timer is fired or not. Hence, I think we can safely Reset() once the timer is fired (or) flushTickActive == false
