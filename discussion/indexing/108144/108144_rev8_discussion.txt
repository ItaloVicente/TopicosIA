DESCRIPTION:

MB-32655 Propagate mutation arrival time from projector to indexer

The remote address is retrieved from dataport server along with
the incoming message and passed onto the stream reader. This
address is as key in projector latency map. The latency is
calculated per stream.

The mutation arrival time from projector to indexer is sent only
once every second. This is to avoid the overhead of sending too much
data

Line:330, secondary/indexer/mutation_manager.go -> It would help if you have a holding object for latency map in stats and provide helper methods to update/get the map. This will make the code cleaner. This complexity doesn't belong to mutation manager.

Line:114, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> On every recovery, stream reader is going to be shutdown and recreated. You should init the localLatencyMap with the one from stats manager, so as not to overwrite the earlier stats.

Line:235, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> creating a new slice here for every mutation will increase the garbage. using a struct would be a better option.

Line:263, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> I think if a KV node gets failed over due to network partition, it will get treated as i/o timeout in dataport. And stream reader will see it as connection error with a set of vbuckets. The clean up will get missed in that case.

Line:519, secondary/indexer/stream_reader.go -> It would be good to avoid garbage generated to fmt.Sprintf as this is a very perf sensitive path. e.g. you can keep the local latency map indexed by raddr only as streamId is fixed.
