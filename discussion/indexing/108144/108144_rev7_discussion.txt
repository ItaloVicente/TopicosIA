DESCRIPTION:

MB-32655 Propagate mutation arrival time from projector to indexer

The remote address is retrieved from dataport server along with
the incoming message and passed onto the stream reader. This
address is as key in projector latency map. The latency is
calculated per stream.

The mutation arrival time from projector to indexer is sent only
once every second. This is to avoid the overhead of sending too much
data
