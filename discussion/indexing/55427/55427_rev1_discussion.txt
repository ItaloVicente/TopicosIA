Same comment as per 55426 - any reason why you didn't just use the original patch I created at http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/55426/?

Dave, I have some changes to the way diagnostic dir is obtained from ns_server through a switch. Hence used your change and modified it

So in memcached / kv-engine at least we'd generally just submit a new version of the existing patch (given it's a small fraction of it which you have changed). 

That also preserves more accurate author information, so things like git blame etc will show the actual author of the code (i.e. currently all the breakpad code will show up as the wrong author).

It additionally doesn't pollute gerrit/Jira with multiple patches which essentially do the same thing.

I'll remove the -1 for now as I don't know how you guys manage your code in gsi, but I'd prefer keeping the original patch (and making whatever tweaks necessary to it). I'll leave it in your hands.

Dave, you can update your review too to use diagDir as in this review? You can submit the same too. We first check in to "testing" branch of indexing project and then merge to sherlock.

You can just re-submit this - there's no permission check on gerrit - anyone can submit a new version of anyone else's patch

(I don't currently have a Go environment setup so it would likely be quicker for you to do it).
