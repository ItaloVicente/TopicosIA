DESCRIPTION:

MB-32052 Use fine grained locking for accessing indexSnapMap

Whenever storage manager receives a message to create a snapshot
it acquires muSnap lock and clones the indexSnapMap and passes
it to createSnapshotWorker method. This method is asyncronous in
nature.

After the snapshot is created in createSnapshotWorker, the
indexSnapMap is updated and a notification is sent. When updating
the indexSnapMap, the muSnap lock is acquired again.

Acquiring muSnap lock like this can lead to contention when there
are large number of indexes in the following scenarios:

a. Initial index build for MOI
b. Incremental builds for MOI and Plasma

In this patch, we address the issue by making the snapshot locking
fine grained. With fine grained locking, the scope of the lock is
limited to one index instance.

The IndexSnapshotContainer object contains the index snapshot along
with this lock. As an IndexSnapshot object should not be shared between
go-routines with out being serialised, any read (or) write to the
snapshot object happens after acquiring the lock.

In updateSnapMapAndNotify() method, where the snapshot is to be updated
for the index instance, instead of updating the indexSnapMap it self, we
just update the snapshot in the IndexSnapshotContainer object. This will
help us to avoid the course grained locking with muSnap lock.

Any addition or removal of instances in indexSnapMap are serialised with
muSnap lock
