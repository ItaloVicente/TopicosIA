Line:301, secondary/common/cluster_info.go -> Q: Can we move this implementation to couchbase package? secondary/dcp/pools.go file ?

This API can be kept here, but just implementation should be moved to secondary/dcp/pools.go.


Also, change the name of this function as it returns Some limit.

Line:905, secondary/common/cluster_info.go -> I don't think this function is needed, we can directly call pool.GetIndexScopeLimit(bucket, scope) from the caller of this function.

Line:17, secondary/common/collections/collection_defs.go -> run "gofmt" tool on all files changed by you - before sending the code for review.

Line:74, secondary/common/collections/collection_defs.go -> It is a good practice to check for nil values of cmScope.Limits, cmScope.Limits.Index etc.

Also, log a warning message if any of the above mentioned values are nil.

Line:656, secondary/dcp/pools.go -> Why not name it GetCollectionManifest instead of GetCollectionManifest2 ?

Line:659, secondary/dcp/pools.go -> It will be useful to write a comment saying "this function always uses default pool".

Line:924, secondary/dcp/pools.go -> IF this is not used, please remove unused code.

Line:316, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> Instead of meta client, metadata provider should get the limit using cluster_info.

And planner should enforce the limits.

So, please remove the new code from this file. 

You can keep this code locally for your testing - if you need it. But no need to publish it for review :)
