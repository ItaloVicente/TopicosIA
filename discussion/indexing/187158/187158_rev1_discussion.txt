DESCRIPTION:

MB-52972 Fix race condition for transfer token batch

If there are multiple tokens for a destination in a single batch, it is
possible that destination receives the metakv notification in the
following order for 2 tokens TT1 and TT2:

1. TT1 -> TransferTokenCreated
2. TT1 -> TransferTokenInitiate
3. TT2 -> TransferTokenCreated

This is problematic because dest will trigger index build at Step2
without waiting for complete batch of tokens to be accepted.

Master should keep track of all tokens for a dest in a batch and move to
TransferTokenInitiate only after all tokens have been accepted by dest.
