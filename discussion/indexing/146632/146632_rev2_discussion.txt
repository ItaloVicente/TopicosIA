DESCRIPTION:

MB-42743 Improve buffer flush frequency at projector

When the incoming muation rate is slow, projector takes long
time to flush the processed mutations. This will result in high
stale=false scan latencies. Reducing the threshold will help
endpoint to flush more frequently

Line:353, secondary/common/config.go -> Q: After making projector.dataport.bufferTimeout as 5ms, too we need this ?

Do we foresee any advantage in initial build ?

This change is ready for review.
Line:353, secondary/common/config.go -> For initial build, I do not see any advantage. But for incremental builds with slow KV ops/sec, this change is required. Let's say we are doing 10kv ops/sec rate and we keep this value at 100. 

That means flush happens on 5ms boundary. For session consistent scans, this means that there will be 5ms+ latency for all the scans. Keeping this at 10 will ensure 1ms latency from projector at 10kv ops/sec rate and give better session consistent scans

Line:353, secondary/common/config.go -> 10 kv ops per second is too slow for 5ms flush. Thats why, this limit changes from 100 to 10 won't have any impact. My question is, in case of a large in-flow, will be flush too frequently (unnecessarily)?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:353, secondary/common/config.go -> As discussed over Slack, the only impact I see by moving the flush buffer from 100 to 10 is increase in CPU utilisation - due to frequent flusher. From the perf tests, the CPU utilisation of projector is at 50% i.e. half a core. With collections, since we do less data processing, the CPU is saved by a great factor already. Hence, this should not be a problem.
