DESCRIPTION:

MB-28950: Increase default connection poolSize for GSI query client to 5000.

1. Introduce a setting to hold low watermark for num connections.
2. Introduce a setting to hold "batch size" i.e. number of connections to be released in one iteration.
3. Introduce a background thread to release connections that are not needed.
3.1. Don't reduce num of free connections below low watermark.
3.2. Don't reduce num of free connections below current active connection count.
3.3. Calculate expected number of connections based on: exponentially weighted moving
     average, and current active connection count.

Line:244, secondary/queryport/client/conn_pool.go -> Lets say curActConns = 1500, avg = 1800, minPoolSizeWM = 1000, freeConns = 1200. This function will return 1800 as numRetConns. 

In releaseConns, we release only if fc > numRetConns. So those 1200 conns may never free up. Is this the intended behavior? 

Or do you want to free up if fc + curActConns > numRetConns?
