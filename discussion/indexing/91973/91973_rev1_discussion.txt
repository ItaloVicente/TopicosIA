DESCRIPTION:

MB-28950: Increase default connection poolSize for GSI query client to 5000.

1. Introduce a setting to hold low watermark for num connections.
2. Introduce a background thread to release connections that are not needed.
2.1. Don't reduce num of free connections below low watermark.
2.2. Don't reduce num of free connections below last active connection count.
2.3. Calculate expected number of connections based on: weighted average of
     active connections for last few seconds.

Great job Amit! Please see a couple of comments. I am assuming the unit tests also cover/test sustained high connections usage b/n min and max limits.
Line:250, secondary/queryport/client/conn_pool.go -> cosmetic: should probably be renamed to CONN_RELEASE_BATCHSIZE?

Line:269, secondary/queryport/client/conn_pool.go -> Rather than performing a move/shift of all items everytime, can we use actConnHist like a ring buffer? In other words, everytime just update the next slot and rollover 0 when i > NUM_CONN_RELEASE_INTERVALS

Line:57, secondary/queryport/client/scan_client.go -> It does not look like it gets used anywhere in scan_client.

The "exact" test for sustained high connection usage (for 15-20 seconds) is not covered. Will add a test for that.
Line:250, secondary/queryport/client/conn_pool.go -> This variable is not getting used as a batch size. 

On second thought, if we are okay with releasing max possible connections in every iteration, we don't need this variable.

Line:269, secondary/queryport/client/conn_pool.go -> Will implement this. Thanks for the suggestion :)

Line:57, secondary/queryport/client/scan_client.go -> It gets used only at the time of newConnectionPool. The way of passing arguments here is same for poolSize, poolOverflow etc.
