DESCRIPTION:

MB-28950: Increase default connection poolSize for GSI query client to 5000.

1. Introduce a setting to hold low watermark for num connections.
2. Introduce a background thread to release connections that are not needed.
2.1. Don't reduce num of free connections below low watermark.
2.2. Don't reduce num of free connections below last active connection count.
2.3. Calculate expected number of connections based on: weighted average of
     active connections for last few seconds.

Line:180, secondary/queryport/client/conn_pool.go -> Isn't better to increment this in GetWithTimeout() since this is also a public method?

Line:235, secondary/queryport/client/conn_pool.go -> It will take 10s for actConnHist to fill up.  Since it iterates through NUM_CONN_REALEASE_INTERVALS, there will be a lot of 0.  So the sum will be lower than it actually is.   But I guess it is ok since this function will do a max(cp.minPoolSizeWM, num).

Line:245, secondary/queryport/client/conn_pool.go -> why do divide by sumOfWeights rather than NUM_CONN_RELEASE_INTERVALS?  This is just a question.

Line:246, secondary/queryport/client/conn_pool.go -> Should it be max(cp.curActConns, average)?  In this case, we are comparing the latest active conns, rather than the number of active conns 500ms ago.

Line:263, secondary/queryport/client/conn_pool.go -> the goroutine needs to terminate when connectionPool is closed.
