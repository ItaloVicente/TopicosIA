Line:43, secondary/indexer/mutation_queue.go -> yes, I'll add that.

Line:110, secondary/indexer/mutation_queue.go -> The only possibility I see is when writing to channel "datach <- m" and if that channel is closed. But as this library is creator/owner of the channel(and the only one closing this channel), I don't think it should happen.

Line:110, secondary/indexer/mutation_queue.go -> Right.  Will just putting a defer statement for unlock works as well?  Just to be safe.
