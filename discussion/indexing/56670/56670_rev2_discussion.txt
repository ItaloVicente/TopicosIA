DESCRIPTION:

MB-15931: load balancing.

- pick optimal replica based on load.
- replicas with approximately equal load (controlled by `equivalenceFactor`)
  will be randomly picked.
- to prevent abnormal skews in load balancing logic,
  a configurable random-weight is used to revert to random pick of
  replicas.

This patch also solves https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-16636

I haven't understood the logic correctly. I think it would be better if John/Siri reviews this change.
Line:245, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> This lock is becoming a scalability bottleneck. We may need to refactor it.
