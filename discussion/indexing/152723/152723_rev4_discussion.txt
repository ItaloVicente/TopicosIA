DESCRIPTION:

MB-45553 Part 1: Split waitersMu mutex out of generic mu mutex

This patch partially fixes the MB by changing ServiceMgr.waiters field
from sharing the main mu mutex to having its own waitersMu mutex. This
will enable indexer to respond to a GetTaskList or GetTopologyChange
cancel (from ns_server via cbauth) immediately.

A follow-up fix is still needed to address the problem of the initial
API processing needing the mu mutex to copy and check the current
state object. The mutex is needed even just to check the current
state's revision number, as well as to copy and return current state
if caller passed a nil revision or current revision is newer.

As mentioned on the ticket, I don't think this patch alone solves the referenced bug as even though GetCurrentTopology goroutines that are waiting will be able to return when they receive a cancel notification, the service API code will immediately issue another GetCurrentTopology call which will block competing on the mu mutex. 

One other comment inline.
Line:1676, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> It feels like this needs to be a full lock as m.waiters is being changed, but maybe it's ok. I guess my main question is, is this assignment guaranteed to be atomic:
    m.waiters = make(waiters)

If so, then it's probably fine, but a bit disconcerting. 

A full wouldn't hurt here though, it would seem.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1676, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> Good catch. I changed it to write lock.
