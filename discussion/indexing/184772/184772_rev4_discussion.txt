DESCRIPTION:

MB-55062 Retry dropIndex if index is in async recovery

If index is in async recovery, dropIndex would fail with
"ErrIndexInAsyncRecovery". In such a case, sleep for 5 seconds
and retry drop index so that by the end of rebalance cleanup,
all indexes would be properly deleted.

Otherwise, if index is dropped during rebalance and /dropIndex fails
with ErrIndexInAsyncRecovery, then a new DDL with same name on same
keyspace will fail because of duplicate index name. To avoid such
cases, /dropIndex is retried.

It is usually not expected to recover an index for more than
10 min. Hence, used 10min as the upper threshold for retries
