DESCRIPTION:

MB-55062 Retry dropIndex if index is in async recovery

If index is in async recovery, dropIndex would fail with
"ErrIndexInAsyncRecovery". In such a case, sleep for 5 seconds
and retry drop index so that by the end of rebalance cleanup,
all indexes would be properly deleted.

It is usually not expected to recover an index for more than
10 min. Hence, used 10min as the upper threshold for retries
