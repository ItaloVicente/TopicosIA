DESCRIPTION:

MB-42598 Throttle the simultaneous systemcalls during persistence

During snapshot persistence in MOI, when there are large number of
indexes, multiple go-routines can simultaneously invoke systemcalls.
Each go-routine that invokes a systemcall can spawn an OS thread and
this can exhaust the 10000 thread limit of the golang runtime.

This patch will limit the number of simultaneous systemcalls that can
happen during snapshot persistence by using the moiWriterSemaphoreCh

This is independent of snapshot creation as we use a fake snapshot while persistence so that we don't hold snapshot's for longer duration of time. I see no impact on snapshot creation

Line:913, secondary/memdb/memdb.go -> snap cannot be closed without initializing the delta writers. Without the delta writers, items in snap that were deleted in future snapshot can go missing in the disk snapshot.
