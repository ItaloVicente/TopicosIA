DESCRIPTION:

MB-42598 Throttle the simultaneous number of systemcalls during persistence

During snapshot persistence in MOI, when there are large number of
indexes, multiple go-routines can simultaneously invoke systemcalls.
Each go-routine that invokes a systemcall can spawn an OS thread and
this can exhaust the 10000 thread limit of the golang runtime.

This patch will limit the number of simultaneous systemcalls that can
happen during snapshot persistence by using the moiWriterSemaphoreCh
