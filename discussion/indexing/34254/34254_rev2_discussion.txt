Looks like markdown doesn't treat newline as line break. The content with 80 line width still renders like the old one. Documentation says:
"When you do want to insert a <br /> break tag using Markdown, you end a line with two or more spaces, then type return."

Please see 1 inline comment as well.
Line:13, secondary/docs/design/overview.md -> The initial 2 spaces before "  The projector" are for auto-alignment with the bullets(markdown syntax). Looks mis-aligned on the UI without these. I think we should keep these. 
This applies to other 4 components as well.

These are trivial changes, we can get back to it later.
