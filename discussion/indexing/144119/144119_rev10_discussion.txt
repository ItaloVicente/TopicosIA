DESCRIPTION:

MB-42220 Filter solution to remove un-necessary replica movements

Consider a placement before rebalance: i1:n1, i2:n2, i3:n3

After the planner run, if the placement generated is i1:n2, i2:n3,
i3:n4, then the movement of i2 and i3 are un-necessary as i1,i2,i3
are all replica instances. Instead i1 can be moved to i4. This patch
takes care of updating the generated solution to handle such
scenarios

Line:265, secondary/planner/executor.go -> From what I understand, after this named loop, the transfer map has final set of transfers. So, why do we need a complex logic below ? I think we can just update destNode, without again iterating over the indexes (line 282) and placement (lie 295). Isn't it?

This change is ready for review.
Line:265, secondary/planner/executor.go -> Yes. The transferMap will have final set of transfers but planner can have even more transfers. E.g., if there are a chain of transfers from n1->n2, n2->n3,n3->n4 and we decided to move n1->n4, then for the instances being moved from n2 and n3, we need to update the destination node. So, the for loop at line 282 does two things: 1) update final placement, 2) Reset planner decided placement

That information will not be present in transferMap. It only contains the final movements. So, we iterate over all the indexes, check if it is a part of final movement and if it is not, then we reset the destination node i.e. the destination node will be made the same as initial node to prevent any transfers.

That's the reason why the for loop at line 282.

Line:282, secondary/planner/executor.go -> In this loop, I don't see we are using transferMap anywhere ? Is it expected?
