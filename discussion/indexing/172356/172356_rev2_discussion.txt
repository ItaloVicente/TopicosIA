DESCRIPTION:

MB-51363 Use FORCE_INMEM_SNAP type for forced inmemory snapshots

In scenarios where an INMEM_SNAP snapshot is forced, there is an
undesired side effect - The streamKeyspaceIdNeedsCommitMap will
be set to true. This causes timekeeper to FORCE_COMMIT a snapshot
even if there is no change in time timestamp from last disk
snapshot. ForestDB does not like this as it's snapshot cleanup
scheme is based on timestamp. So, if there are two disk snapshots
with the same timestamp, then the snapshots can not be discarded.

Other than ForestDB, it will un-necessarity generate FORCE_COMMIT
snapshots for both MOI and plasma. The current fix will try to
avoid the problem by using a new snapshot type - FORCE_INMEM_SNAP
to distinguish between the cases where an actual INMEM_SNAP is
generated vs cases where an inmemory snapshot is forced
