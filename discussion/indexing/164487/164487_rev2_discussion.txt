If I understand the logic correctly, Before Put() we close the doneCh of the queue. When doing GetQueueFromPool(), we are not re-initialising doneCh. Is that expected?

Also, Just curious - what were the allocation times before this change?

Line:91, secondary/queryport/client/queue.go -> Also, you may want to re-initialise the buf slice
