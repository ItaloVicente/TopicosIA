Patch Set 4:

For pre-CC backup, is there an expectation to support remap indexes to non-default collection?

Nothing like this is mentioned in the document. I will ask the query.

Also, this will be supported with this patch - if the remap had "_default" as old scope/collection name. As we are doing defn.SetCollectionDefaults() in convertImage().

Also, one problem with such situations is WHERE clause, old backup will contain indexes with a WHERE clause, on the other hand with collections, new indexes should/will not have/need such a WHERE clause - of they are being created on non-default collection. So, in such cases, the user workflow won't be straight forward. 

So, functionally wee should be able to support this, but logically, I am not sure of a valid use cases around this area.
