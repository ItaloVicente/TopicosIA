DESCRIPTION:

MB-39148 Avoid copying of mutation key and partition key

Using append() based logic with every mutation means that the
mutation key and partition key will be copied from keyVersions
struct to mutation struct. Instead, assign the slice reference
to save on copy

If I remember correctly, the reason for the copy is to allow protobuf keyversions to free up the allocation. Otherwise, when the mutations are sitting in the queue and holding on to reference to protobuf, all the associated allocations done by underlying protobuf library cannot be freed up(and those are substantial) and was leading to a slowdown.

Ok. Got it now. I misunderstood how golang GC would work. I see that it does not partially free a slice or structure if at-least one reference to it exist through it's members. What you said makes sense. Will abandon this patch
