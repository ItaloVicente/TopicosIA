DESCRIPTION:

MB-27629: Optimize composition of primary index scans in scan_request

A new logic for sorting and merging for primary index spans
which does not follow the earlier logic for secondary index.

- Sort spans based on low
- Incrementally add one span at a time to existing set of scans
- In each addition, either it can get merged to previous scan
  or a new scan needs to be created if there is no overap

- Added a few targeted tests
