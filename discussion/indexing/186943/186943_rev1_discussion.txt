DESCRIPTION:

MB-55476 Use retryableIndexById method to avoid stale index cache

When there are concurrent Refresh() calls on same keyspace,
following race condition can exist:

a. Go-routine-1 G1 invoked Refresh()
b. G1::Refresh() invoked G1::safeupdate method
c. Safeupdate method has read the newmeta
d. Go-routine G2 has finished CreateIndex and then it called
   Refresh. The newmeta read by G1 does not contain the
   index in the meta
e. As G1::Refresh() is already in progress, G2::Refresh will
   wait for G1::Refresh to finish
f. After G1::Refresh() finishes, G2::Refresh() will use the
   same cache list of G1 which does not contain the newly
   created index. This will lead to client returning
   "Index not found" error inspite of successful creation

To fix the race, client will retry refresh and IndexById()
method before returning success or failure to the caller.
