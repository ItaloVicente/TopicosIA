Line:765, secondary/projector/worker.go -> Did you intend to use RLock here?

Line:774, secondary/projector/worker.go -> Q: If the encode buffer is smaller than the required size, then the code will allocate new encode buffer right? Instead of failing? If yes, do we foresee any advantage of increasing the size? 

Even in case of possible perf benefit, I believe that there should be some upper cap on buffer size to avoid side effect of an outlier mutation. May be 1 MB or 4 MB?

Line:781, secondary/projector/worker.go -> Should this be updated outside of the if condition ?

This change is ready for review.
Line:765, secondary/projector/worker.go -> This lock is only being held with cleaning-up endpoints. I don't see that happening often. So, it is fine even if we use a plain lock as the operations that happen while holding this lock are completely non-blocking in nature

Line:774, secondary/projector/worker.go -> Here, we are decreasing the size of encodeBuf to maximum length of encoded key as observed in last 1 hour. This will help to reduce idle time memory utilisation of projector

Line:781, secondary/projector/worker.go -> So, this method gets invoked every 1 minute. Hence, we want to update lastBufferSizeCheckTime only when we have elapsed the configured duration - defaulted to 60 minutes. I will updated this variable name to make it less confusing
