DESCRIPTION:

MB-39735 Do not accept cpu or memory profile names in settings endpoint

The profile names will be defaulted to "indexer_cpu.pprof",
"indexer_mem.pprof", "projector_cpu.pprof", "projector_mem.pprof"

Additionally, the user can specify a directory where these files can
go to using the options: "cpuProfDir", "memProfDir". Note that the
directory should exist and has write permissions for couchbase user.
Otherwise, the call would silently fail.

Sample usage:
curl -u <username>:<password> http://localhost:9102/settings
        -X POST -d '{"indexer.settings.cpuProfile":true,
                     "indexer.settings.cpuProfDir":"logs/"}'

Line:209, secondary/common/config.go -> Q: Will this handle mixed mode ?

Line:1962, secondary/common/config.go -> Minor: Can (should) we make these names similar to the names used in cbcollect ?

Line:7489, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> use path or filepath library e.g. path.Join. The libraries encapsulate the OS specific behavior.

Line:209, secondary/common/config.go -> Consider a cluster with one 6.0 indexer and one 7.0 indexer. Consider cpuProfile set to true in all these cases

a. Indexer on 6.0 got request with cpuProfFname - 6.0 indexer would treat this as valid config and update metakv. When 7.0 indexer receives the metakv callback, it would try to update cpuProfFname which it can not find in it's config. So, it will log an error. But, it will still generate the CPU profile

b. Indexer on 6.0 got a request with cpuProfDir - 6.0 indexer would treat this as invalid config as it is not aware of cpuProfDir. So, it would not set this setting in metakv. However, it would generate a profile using last known cpuProfFname. When 7.0 indexer gets metakv callback, it would not contain cpuProfDir and therefore would not update config. But, it would generate the profile in default directory

c. Indexer on 7.0 got request with cpuProfFname - 7.0 indexer would treat this as invalid config and would not update metakv with cpuProfFname. 7.0 indexer would generate the cpu profile in default directory. When 6.0 indexer receives callback, it would only contain cpuProfile set to true. It would use the last known cpuProfFname to generate the profile

d. Indexer on 7.0 got request with cpuProfDir - 7.0 indexer would generate profile in the user specified directory. 6.0 indexer would treat this as invalid config but it would generate profile using last known cpuProfFname

In summary, when cpuProfile is set to true, profiles will always be generated. 6.0 indexer will use the last known cpuProfFname to generate the profiles. 7.0 indexer would generate the profiles in default directory. The same applies for memory profiles as well

Line:1962, secondary/common/config.go -> cbcollect would name those files with ".log" extension. I would prefer to keep the names as it is.

Line:7489, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Thanks Amit. Updated the code to use filepath library
