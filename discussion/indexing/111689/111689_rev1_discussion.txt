DESCRIPTION:

MB-33701 Ensure indexer availability when vbuckets are not available

When some vbuckets become un-available and indexer is in bootstrap loop,
indexer would end-up in a rolling bootstrap until vbuckets become
available. In some scenarios, this can block cluster wide operations
like rebalance.

This patch aims to address this problem by removing the computation
of build timestamp from bootstrap loop. The build timestamp's are now
computed asyncronously after indexer has successfully opened all the
streams with projector. Once the indexer is able to retrive the
timestamps, it updates its internal book-keeping maps and also
timekeeper

Patch Set 1:

Following tests have been done:

a. Crash indexer when index on MAINT_STREAM is building -> It is expected for the indexer to build the index after recovery without and problem
b. Crash indexer when index on INIT_STREAM is building -> It is expected for the indexer to build the index after recovery without and problem
c. Hard failover 2 KV nodes and restart the indexer -> It is expected of the indexer to come out of bootstrap loop and try to start the bucket streams
d. Using ephemeral buckets, hard failover one KV node, restart another KV node and restart indexer -> It is expected of the indexer to come out of bootstrap loop and try to start the bucket streams
