DESCRIPTION:

MB-33701 Ensure indexer availability when vbuckets are not available

When some vbuckets become un-available and indexer is in bootstrap loop,
indexer would end-up in a rolling bootstrap until vbuckets become
available. In some scenarios, this can block cluster wide operations
like rebalance.

This patch aims to address this problem by removing the computation
of build timestamp from bootstrap loop. The build timestamp's are now
computed asyncronously after indexer has successfully opened all the
streams with projector. Once the indexer is able to retrive the
timestamps, it updates its internal book-keeping maps and also
timekeeper
