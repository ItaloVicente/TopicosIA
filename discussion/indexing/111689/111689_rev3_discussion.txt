DESCRIPTION:

MB-33701 Ensure indexer availability when vbuckets are not available

When some vbuckets become un-available and indexer is in bootstrap loop,
indexer would end-up in a rolling bootstrap until vbuckets become
available. In some scenarios, this can block cluster wide operations
like rebalance.

This patch aims to address this problem by removing the computation
of build timestamp from bootstrap loop. The build timestamp's are now
computed asyncronously after indexer has successfully opened all the
streams with projector. Once the indexer is able to retrive the
timestamps, it updates its internal book-keeping maps and also
timekeeper

Line:6739, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> some form of serialization mechanism is required to make sure a buildTs computed later doesn't get overwritten by something computer earlier. This can be a simple check based on the time this call was initiated.

Line:6739, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> I have updated the patch to use a lock based serialisation as it can serve two purposes:
(i) It serializes the update of buildTs to indexer and timekeeper so that the buildTs computed earlier by one go-routine can not overwrite the buildTs computed later by another go-routine
(ii) Incase of any issues with KV, it prevents multiple go-routines to flood the logs with error messages while fetching the KVT's
