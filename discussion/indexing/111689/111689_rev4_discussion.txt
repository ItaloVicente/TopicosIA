DESCRIPTION:

MB-33701 Ensure indexer availability when vbuckets are not available

When some vbuckets become un-available and indexer is in bootstrap loop,
indexer would end-up in a rolling bootstrap until vbuckets become
available. In some scenarios, this can block cluster wide operations
like rebalance.

This patch aims to address this problem by removing the computation
of build timestamp from bootstrap loop. The build timestamp's are now
computed asyncronously after indexer has successfully opened all the
streams with projector. Once the indexer is able to retrive the
timestamps, it updates its internal book-keeping maps and also
timekeeper

Line:6749, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> mutex does not provide any serialization guarantee.

Line:397, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> only setting the buildTs is not sufficient. If all mutations have already been received and there is no flush, checkInitialBuildDone will not be called and build will keep waiting. checkInitialBuildDone needs to be called from here, but need to check the side effects.

Line:397, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Thanks for catching this Deep. I now understand the purpose of checking initial build done in StreamRequestDone, RecoveryDone scenarios. I thought about the normal/crash-recover/rollback scenarios and do not see any side-effects so far to have a checkInitialBuildDone here. If there are no-mutations, we update the book-keeping and merge the streams (if required). If there are further mutations, it will be handled by FLUSH_DONE message. 

I have not checked for any pending stream merge (like in handleStreamRequestDone() (or) handleRecoveryDone() )  here because:
a. If index moved to CATCHUP state and indexer crashed, stream merge will be taken care by handleRecoveryDone
b. If index is in INITIAL state and crashed, then handleInitBuildDoneAck() would check for pending stream merge (If buildTs is updated after INDEXER_RECOVERY_DONE message)
