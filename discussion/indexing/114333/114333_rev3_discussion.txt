DESCRIPTION:

MB-35699 Cleanup book-keeping in upr.go on STREAMEND from memcached

Feed book-keeping methods (addToFeed, removeFromFeed) in upr.go expects
that a vb is mapped to only one memcached.dcpFeed. During rebalance, when
memcached issues a STREAM_END but the vb-book keeping is not cleared in
upr.go. This can result in one vb mapped to multiple memcached.DcpFeed's.

This patch addresses the issue by cleaning up book-keeping in upr.go when a
StreamEnd is received from memcached

Line:52, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> maybe call this "supvch" to keep it more in line with the projector style.

Line:624, secondary/dcp/upr.go -> is it possible to call removefromfeed to do the cleanup?
