DESCRIPTION:

MB-35699 Cleanup book-keeping in upr.go on STREAMEND from memcached

Feed book-keeping methods (addToFeed, removeFromFeed) in upr.go expects
that a vb is mapped to only one memcached.dcpFeed. During rebalance, when
memcached issues a STREAM_END but the vb-book keeping is not cleared in
upr.go. This can result in one vb mapped to multiple memcached.DcpFeed's.

This patch addresses the issue by cleaning up book-keeping in upr.go when a
StreamEnd is received from memcached

Line:105, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Saw this code, while reviewing this patch:
Does this feed.done really help to synchronize the code ? Btw, this comment is unrelated to this patch. If you decide to revisit this sync. logic you might have to do it in a separate patch.

Line:196, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> We send STREAM_END downstream, when there is a panic in this gen_server routine. Do you think we will have to send this message to supvCmdCh ?

Line:281, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> We are also sending a STREAM_END downstream if do_receive routine has ended. Should we also send to supvCmdCh ?

Line:287, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> We are also sending a STREAM_END downstream if handle_packet return "exit" (but this is just a place holder for now). Should we also send to supvCmdCh ?

Line:387, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> There is a STREAM_END sent downstream here. Please check with DCP documentation / kv-engin folks to decide whether this is initiated by dcp-producer and may be then we have to send STREAM_END to supvCmdCh channel as well..

Line:190, secondary/dcp/upr.go -> I might suggest to add another command-type for STREAM_END. Note that it is easy to review/maintain gen_server source when all commands are consolidated in one place.

Line:286, secondary/dcp/upr.go -> By adding STREAM_END as part of the msg-op-code (refer earlier command) we can fold the logic into single block.

Line:328, secondary/dcp/upr.go -> a typo is there in the log message (minor).

Line:623, secondary/dcp/upr.go -> Another alternative, as opposed to comparing the pointers, would be to do ``singleFeed.dcpFeed.name == dcpFeed.name``

Line:105, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> The stats_manager can still the pointer to stats object while the feed is purged. To prevent logging the stats of a purged feed, I used this "done" variable. I could have used the feed.isClosed() method but I think I missed the isClosed() method when I implemented this patch. I will clean this code in a separate patch

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:196, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Thanks for pointing this out. My initial idea for not sending these StreamEnd's to supvCmdCh when genServer/doReceive/handlePacket exits is because we purge the feed during a StreamRequest and initialize a new dcpFeed. During purge, we also reset the book-keeping.

However, I now see the case where the purged feed may not be selected because the purged feed will always contain more number of vb's as clean-up is not happening. And this will defeat the purpose of vb balancing across multiple connections. I have updated the code to send StreamEnd to supvCmdCh in other cases as well

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:387, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> DCP_CLOSESTREAM comes as a response to DCP_CLOSE_STREAM from projector i.e. from doDcpCloseStream which will remove the vb from book-keeping. So, this STREAM_END need not be sent to supvCmdCh

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:190, secondary/dcp/upr.go -> The command-types specified here are not visible in dcp_feed.go (as it is in memcached package and this code is in couchbase package). I did not see an easy way to make this types visible to both the packages without lot of code changes. So, I used transport.STREAM_END which is visible to both the packages.
