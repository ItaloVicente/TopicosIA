Mart -- we saw some strange hangs where one of the threads was in the logging callback. So removing it in a toy build to see if this was a problem or a red-herring. Will keep you updated, Bastian is trying out this toy build.

Steve just brought this up as well.  My own opinion is that there is more to it than this.  We do this quite a lot with RocksDB where our merge operator is written in Go, and to my knowledge, exclusively called by threads created in C that Go has no knowledge of.

Prior to 1.5.1 this would occasionally panic (but not hang), this panic was fixed in 1.5.1
