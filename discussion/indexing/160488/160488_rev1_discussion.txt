DESCRIPTION:

MB-47600 Treat NaN progress as 0.1

When indexer participates in rebalance, the transfer tokens
will not be computed until indexer finishes planning. During
this time, indexer reports progress as NaN to ns_server and
ns_server would fail the rebalance if NaN is seen for more
than 60 seconds.

Instead of failing rebalance, indexer would now start sending
progress as 0.1 even if the progress computed is NaN.
