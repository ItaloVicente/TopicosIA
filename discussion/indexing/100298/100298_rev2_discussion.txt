Patch Set 2:

@Deep, @Jeelan, I know that there are saparate channels in kvdata. My point is: is this fix good enough? Or it is solving only part of the problem.

Please refer to 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wdJlrijEq2Yfuk-PQrNPJq5L9geQ61RfcZq7oRzEcE4/edit?usp=sharing

This is the experiment I had performed. Here, we can see kvdata.UpdateTs has taken about 7 mins. So, my question is do we need any prioritisation of the control messages over mutations. Right now, both have same priority (as per golang documentation, if both channels in a select statement are ready, the channel will be picked pseudo-randomly https://golang.org/ref/spec#Select_statements)

Note: I have attached this document to the jira ticket https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-31157.

@Amit, Your point is valid on golang pseuodo-randomly picking the channel in select. This patch achieves separation of control & data channels. Not prioritisation. Could you please run your experiment with this patch (it's merged to unstable) and let us know the results? Assuming we also had prioritisation, if a data message takes long to process (7 mins in your case), control message would still need to wait, isn't it?

Sure Jeelan. 

In my opinion, I will need to spend at least a couple of days on MB-31157 to test the patch and work on the fix if needed (I am not sure what further changes will be required). I will pick it up sometime in mad-hatter time frame. Note: I have this ticket open in my name and targeted to mad-hatter.
