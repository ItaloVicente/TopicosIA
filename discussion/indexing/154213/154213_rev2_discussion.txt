DESCRIPTION:

MB-46318 skip logging info for disable align TS

If disableAlign is set for the TS, it is possible that lastFlushTs has flushed upto
snapEnd but the current TS seqno is smaller as snap alignment was disabled.
Skip logging this information as this can flood the logs when partial snapshots
are getting processed.
