DESCRIPTION:

MB-48815 Move sync message generation to endpoint

Pre 7.1, KVData component sends a periodic sync message to indexer.
This sync message happens per vbucket. The primary purpose of
this sync message is to keep the TCP connection alive between
projector and indexer. This message is not consumed for any
functional purpose at indexer

In setup’s like cloud where the server can be idle for many days,
waking the go-routines every 2 seconds to send sync messages for
all the vbuckets will require some CPU resources. In a multi-tenent
setup, where multiple users access the same cluster, idle processes
should not consume any CPU (ideally).

To minimize the idle time CPU utilisation, the sync message is moved
from KVData component to endpoint component. This means that, in a setup
with 30 buckets, 3 kv nodes instead of waking 30 go-routines every 2
seconds and sending sync mesage for ~340 * 30 vbuckets, endpoint will
just send one sync message every 20 seconds to keep the TCP connection
alive
