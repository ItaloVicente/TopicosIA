DESCRIPTION:

MB-52930 Batch sibling transfer tokens in same batch for shard rebalancer

This function batches a group of transfer tokens
according to the following rules:

All tokens of a bucket moving from one subcluster
to another will be in the same batch. E.g.,
if bucket_1 has indexes on subcluster_1:indexer_1 and
subcluster_1:indexer_2 - There will be 2 transfer tokens
for this bucket movement. Both these transfer tokens will
remain in same batch.

As indexer source node can drop index instances only after
both tokens move to READY state, publishing them in different
batches can lead to a deadlock where after finishing the first
batch, tokens would wait for sibling to come to Ready but sibling
would wait for initial token to move to Deleted state.
