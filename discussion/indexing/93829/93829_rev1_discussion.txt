DESCRIPTION:

MB-29317: plasma - serialize persistence by instance

When a large number of indexes start writing to disk simultaneously,
it causes disk to be 100% utilized which impacts query latency
when node is in DGM.
First control concurrency of persistence by persistenceCPUPercent
Now, since persistence is already parallelized,
only allow 1 index to perform full persistence at a given time.

Re-uploading after fixing CI test failure. Issue was the absence of serialization of main and back index recovery point creation.
