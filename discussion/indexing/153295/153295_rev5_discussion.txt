DESCRIPTION:

MB-46054 Handle UNKNOWN_COLLECTION status at timekeeper

Attempt KV stream repair when indexer receives UNKNOWN_SCOPE
or UNKNOWN_COLLECTION error using the following logic:

a. Timekeeper will reset the vbucket state to VB_INIT for the
vbucket and set a flag to force MTR
b. After the on-going MTR is done, timekeeper will call
repairMissingStreamBegin. This will check for vbuckets in
state VBS_INIT and trigger repair
c. During repair as the flag to force MTR is true, timekeeper
will send a message to indexer to trigger repair
d. During repair indexer will validate collection Id and close
the keyspace if the collection is deleted
