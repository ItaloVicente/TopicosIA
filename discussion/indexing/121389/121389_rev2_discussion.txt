should we do this in multiple patches? So that we will know the impact ?
Line:106, secondary/tests/functionaltests/set02_mutations_test.go -> Should we first try with 20 second?

Line:35, secondary/tests/functionaltests/set15_alter_test.go -> I think 10 second delay here is fine.

Line:106, secondary/tests/functionaltests/set02_mutations_test.go -> yeah we could do that

Line:35, secondary/tests/functionaltests/set15_alter_test.go -> Why would we need 10s wait after all indexed drop?
