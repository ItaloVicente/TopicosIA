DESCRIPTION:

MB-52308 Part 6 (7.2.0 1739) Elixir Pause-Resume feature for GSI

ps01-04: Pause close DCP streams. Update set14 test to delete and
  recreate default bucket at the end to avoid leaving a hosed bucket
  with no DCP streams at end of current tests due to incomplete
  CancelTask(Pause) implementation.

This patch is not complete yet.

1. Known problem: indexer.go handlePauseStopMutatingBucket() was self-
   deadlocking on the stateLock mutex, so I temporarily commented out
   its coarse-grained lock of that. Methods called also need this lock
   so we cannot just hold it throughout handlePauseStopMutatingBucket().

2. set14_rebalance_test.go TestPause test needs to be extended to more
   thoroughly test stopping the DCP streams.

NOTE: Grep for "kjc" in all GSI code to find markers I have left of
things that need doing. There is much more to be developed in Pause-
Resume besides the marked things -- they are just TODO items in code
that I've already developed.
