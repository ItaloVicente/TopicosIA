DESCRIPTION:

Slice Writer Changes for ForestDB requirements

ForestDB doesn't allow sharing a database handle across threads.
Slice writer now has locks to serialize access to forestdb.
Back-index has 1 extra read-only handle to make the read requests
in parallel.

Other option is to have multiple database connections. But as forestdb
is also going to serialize all write access across threads, it doesn't
make a difference for our use case.

Patch Set 1:

1) ForestDB allows multiple readers concurrent with a single writer.  So what is the ROLock is for? 
2) Isn't that there is a single flusher thread? If so, why do you need the the lock?

1) Yes, the lock is to satisfy the requirement that each thread needs to have its own db connection. ROLock serializes the requests from multiple reader goroutines(threads) as there is only one shared read connection. 

2) Flusher opens 1 goroutine per vbucket. So we have 1024 goroutines per flush. I am putting a patch to make it configurable with default at 16, as I don't see any performance benefit from so many goroutines.

This is superseded by new patchset which doesn't have any locks.
