Line:251, secondary/protobuf/projector/index.go -> Sorry for being a major pain, but couldn't we do the same with m.OldValue as wehave already done with m.Value?
(ie get it in the worker and pass it along to TransportRoute)
That way, we get double the CPU saving..

Line:251, secondary/protobuf/projector/index.go -> Marco, the OldValue code path is not being used. This was to be used if DCP could send us the old value of a mutation in addition to the new value. But looks like that proposal is dead. 

Thanks for digging into the code!

Another thing we can optimize out is the context being used in N1QLTransform.

N1QLTransform:

context := qexpr.NewIndexContext()

This doesn't have any state information and we can just create it once; rather than creating it multiple times per mutation.

func NewIndexContext() Context {
    return &IndexContext{
        now: time.Now(),
    }
} 

The gains may not be substantial. We could defer it to the next release as well.
