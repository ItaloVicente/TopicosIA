Line:546, secondary/projector/feed.go -> pratap, feed.cleanupBucket() will now be called even if feed.actTss[cmd.Bucket] returns !ok.  Is this intended?

Line:546, secondary/projector/feed.go -> Previously, KVDATA shall be called only after all StreamEnd for
dcp-bucket is posted to feed's back-channel.
Now, with the introduction of multiple DCP connection, and also if
there is a crash in KVDATA, there can be some streams active.

Which we observed in one of the logs.

cleanupBucket() is a safe call. Probably I should have made it mandatory
for all edge cases during KVDATA exit.

Please let me know if you find any problems with this.
