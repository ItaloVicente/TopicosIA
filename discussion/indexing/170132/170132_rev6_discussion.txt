DESCRIPTION:

EM BE 50737 (7.1.0 2175) Move MoveConn() back to top of NewRouterEndpoint()

Change not needed - self-healed in build 2223. Possibly it was from
false sharing in CPU cache due to different binary code layout from
compiler.

Obsolete description:
Moving the MoveConn() call in endpoint.go NewRouterEndpoint() back to
the top of the function was verified via toy build 14388 to eliminate
the entire performance regression. (The call was moved down by
EM BE 50322 patch 3:
