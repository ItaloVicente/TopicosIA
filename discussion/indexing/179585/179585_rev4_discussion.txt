Line:146, secondary/indexer/metering_enterprise.go -> After a bit of thought i feel that we can have a boolean flag in both RecordWriteUnits and StartMeteringTxn say something that like billable or etc instead of passing the replicaId directly. We might have other cases that are not related to replicaId where we dont want to bill the units. 

User can call it like RecordWriteUnits(bucket, 100, update, replicaId == 0)

Tomorrow if have another requirement where i don't want to meter proxy instances i need not change this function and just call it like

billable := (replicaId == 0) && (!inst.IsProxy())
RecordWriteUnits(bucket, 100, update, billable)

Line:178, secondary/indexer/metering_enterprise.go -> In the above line we have substituted MeteringTransaction in place of regulator.TransactionalRecorder so that we need not include regulator library in all the places we call this function.

So as i mentioned in other comments please get a boolean flag something like billable here from the parameters and initialise the regulator.TransactionOptions here.

Line:1094, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Check the tabs after the true. Please run the go fmt on the files that you changed to have a uniform format.

Line:1096, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> We can move the initialisation of regulator.TransactionOptions inside the StartMeteringTxn that way we need not include the regulator library everywhere we call this function. May be add a boolean parameter to StartMeteringTxn.

Line:3177, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> We can move the initialisation of regulator.TransactionOptions inside the StartMeteringTxn that way we need not include the regulator library everywhere we call this function. May be add a boolean parameter to StartMeteringTxn.

Line:1, secondary/tests/functionaltests/set24_meter_replica_write_test.go -> These tests might not pass when you add this patch to CI as CI does not run in serverless mode. Please move these test files to another review.

Line:489, secondary/tests/functionaltests/set24_meter_replica_write_test.go -> What was the reason for difference in the Units from index and replica ?

Line:474, secondary/tests/plasmatests/plasma_parallel_test.go -> Add this change to the current patch unlike as opposed to what i mentioned in the new test that you wrote this test might get invoked in CI

Line:152, secondary/tests/plasmatests/plasmatests.go -> Add this change to the current patch unlike as opposed to what i mentioned in the new test that you wrote this test might get invoked in CI

Line:489, secondary/tests/functionaltests/set24_meter_replica_write_test.go -> Test was not waiting for the time taken to update write units
Thus it was returning less units
