DESCRIPTION:

MB-36282: Increment definition versions of index during MoveIndex

If version is not incremented during transfer token generation as
part of move index, it leads to incorrect metadata book-keeping
in metadata provider client as new index instance information
replaces old one as they have same versions. Incrementing definition
Versions ensures partition version is updated correctly leading
correct book-keeping of index topology in metadata provider.

Line:2726, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> Should it be the following?  Each partition may have a different version.  
versions[i] = versions[i] + 1

Line:2726, secondary/indexer/rebalance_service_manager.go -> Yes you are right. I was initially thinking all partitions in a node move together from a source to destination but it is safer to increment the partition version instead of IndexInst.Version. Will make the change
