DESCRIPTION:

MB-52931 Cleanup slices if index is dropped during async recovery

In shard rebalance, index recovery is asynchronous i.e. indexer
will recover the instance in a go-routine and once the instance
is recovered, then the metadata of the instance is updated in
repo.

With the support of DDL during rebalance, it is possible that
an index in async recovery is dropped. In such cases, the index
metadata at indexer is cleared after recovery is finished.

After recovering the index, indexer will check if any delete
command token exists. If it exists, then indexer will cleanup
metadata and close the slices. Otherwise, it will update its
book-keeping with new index instance state.
