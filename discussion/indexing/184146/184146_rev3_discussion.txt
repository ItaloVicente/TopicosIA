DESCRIPTION:

MB-52931 Cleanup slices if index is dropped during async recovery

In shard rebalance, index recovery is asynchronous i.e. indexer
will recover the instance in a go-routine and once the instance
is recovered, then the metadata of the instance is updated in
repo.

With the support of DDL during rebalance, it is possible that
an index in async recovery is dropped. In such cases, the index
metadata at indexer is cleared after recovery is finished.

Indexer maintains a list of instances that are in async recovery.
If drop index happens while async recovery is in progress, then
the indexer book-keeping is cleared. If indexer does not find the
instance in book-keeping after recovery, it will close the slices
and removes the stats.

The index instance map is updated only after recovery is done.
If a drop index arrives while the index is in async recovery,
indexer will send a new error message to lifecycle manager.
This message will help lifecycle manager to queue the index
for back-ground processing. lifecycleMgr::janitor when
processing deleteCommandToken will clear the index from topology
