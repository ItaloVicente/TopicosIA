DESCRIPTION:

MB-51636: Make vbucket fetch in kv_sender and projector synchronous

* kv_sender and projector needs vbmap accurately when there is conn error
* When there is a connection error kv_sender tries to connect to all the
  projectors owning the vbuckets which are marked as conn_err and sends
  vBucket shutdown and they are restarted after that.
* If indexer gets two StreamBegins, without a stream end in between, it
  treats it as connection error as it will not be able to determine the
  owner of the vbucket. This can happen at the time of rebalance.
* Indexer sends Shutdown for the new owner of the vbucket to correct the
  bookkeeping for the vBucket owner.
* If the cache is stale at this point of time shutdown is sent to the
  old owner and shutdown logic works like a broadcast wherein indexer
  will send conn err vbuckets list to all the owners in the list. Each
  projector will shutdown the part that it owns. The old node will
  ignore the vbucket if moved during rebalance and that shutdown never
  happens.
* Projector also needs accurate vbucket list as it getLocalBucket and
  selects the vbuckets that it owns from the list of vbuckets sent by
  the indexer.
