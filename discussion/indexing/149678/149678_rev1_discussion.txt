DESCRIPTION:

MB-44728 Part 1: Fix rebalance create, drop cases of b/s/c not found

This part prevents rebalance from failing during the index metadata
create (destination) and index drop (source) steps of rebalance due
to the bucket, scope, or collection referenced by the transfer token
having been dropped between token creation and token processing.

The fix is for rebalancer to check whether the error string is the
same as one of those from ErrBucketNotFound, ErrScopeNotFound,
or ErrCollectionNotFound and skip ahead (or in the source case just
continue on to) TransferTokenCommit state. This will abort the move
of the index without failing the rebalance.
