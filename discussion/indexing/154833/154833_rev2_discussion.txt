DESCRIPTION:

MB-46513: Bucket flush and dropCollection coinsiding, causes dropCollection event to be missed.
WIP:
Patch 1: during open_stream validate collection keyspace for MAINT_STREAM and processDropCollection if collection is not found.
Patch 2: TBD... MonitorKeyspace to process non-defered index deletion
Have left some debug code commented out for testing purpose which i will remove before final patch is submitted for review.
Have not run the function test yet, this patch is to get the idea right and identify any obvious issues.
Tested by skipping collection processing events from projector and triggering bucket flush.

Patch Set 2:

Hi team, This is fix 1 out of 2 fixes needed to address the issue (fix 1 open_stream to validate collection keyspace for MINT_STREAM and process drop collection for invalid collections, fix 2: monitorkeyspace to handle non-deffered indexes - will try to add code for fix 2 by friday) I have not yet run functional test - going to run it tonight, and have left some commented out code which I had added for debug/test purpose which I will remove before final patch. I have tested code by modifying projector to skip collectionDrop events and then drop the collection followed by flush of buckets.
Let me know your thoughts/suggestions/improvements to make it better.

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> Minor: Consider a blank line so that title does not become big

Line:6263, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> I think this validation should happen before deciding to open streams so that the message sent to other subcomponents are consistent with the list of indexes we are building.

Line:6293, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Instead of sending a message each time, we can probably group the messages

Is there any reason why we need both approaches? If validation at MAINT_STREAM is removing indexes, then do we require the MonitorKeyspace solution as well?

Line:6234, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Readability would be improved by more descriptive variable names than s, i, ll, and l.

Line:6269, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> There are 2 ways to approach this. One option is to keep things eventually consistent. The check for collectionId happens here in a goroutine(like in this patch). As all the sub-components already have the full index list, there is no need to update the list here. processCollectionDrop will cleanup the deleted indexes from all sub-components as well as projector. This will be similar to how cleanup will happen if collection got dropped just after this check passed. If we want to keep it immediately consistent, then the new index list needs to be updated in all sub-components as well and the check needs to happen before this goroutine. But that can take time and block the indexer main loop. First option should be okay I think. Also, consider the case when all collections in the stream get dropped.

Line:6282, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Please check if we need to fetch all the cinfo data in the function here. Looks like we might just need Manifest update. Can we just do a manifest update before using this function ? Just thinking if we can end up in an inconsistent state if we are updating the manifest halfway this function.

Thanks varun, the commit message will be changed, it was WIP to let people know this is only a half patch etc.
Since the validation for bucket is also happening here as well as this is happening in goroutine we are doing the validation for collections here as well. Sending messages in batch would require to change processCollectionDrop which at present handles single collection at a time, At this stage we do not wish to change it and hence batching of messages will not help.

Thanks Deep, i will keep the approach as it is (i.e testing inside go routine and not moving the place of check before we decide to open streams) but will not modify the index inst list since we have already sent the same index inst list to other components. Will test out the case of all collection drop and see if I find anything there.
