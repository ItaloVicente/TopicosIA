DESCRIPTION:

MB-46513: Indexes did not get cleaned up after quorum_failover followed by dropping all collections

Root cause here is bucket flush and dropCollection events coinsided and caused dropCollection event to be missed.
The fix addresses missed dropCollection event by validating collection keyspace
during open_stream for MAINT_STREAM and calls processDropCollection if collection is not found.
This fix should reduce the probablity of issue, it is a required but not a sufficient fix.
To fully fix the issue we will additionally need to improve MonitorKeyspace to process non-defered index deletion,
which is a bigger change and will be addressed seperately.

Line:1376, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> This log can be enabled for ease of debugging. Normally, if you want to keep a log message for later use, instead of commenting it out, you can use logging.Debugf.

Line:6265, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> collection validation is not required in mixed mode. We can check cluster version INDEXER_70_VERSION instead of collectionAware==true, which is true in mixed mode.

Line:6268, secondary/indexer/indexer.go -> Why is this required?

Hi Deep, Thanks for the review comments, the commented out log was to be removed, missed it, will be removing it.
The validKeyspace[tempKeySpace]= true was there to handle the case of keyspaceid=bucket which I was getting in previous patch but with latest patch I missed to remove it (I have handled the case which lead to use of it with setting defaults for scope and collection so it became unnecessary and should be removed), 
I will change the if collectionAware check to use cluster version.
