DESCRIPTION:

MB-45998 use bucket as keyspaceId for recovery bookkeeping

INIT_STREAM uses bucket as keyspaceId for mutation processing in
TsVbuuid. For recovery bookkeeping, keyspaceId was being set as
bucket in TsVbuuid. TsVbuuid.Bucket is not used in rollback
path except it caused a mismatch in Union function when restartTs
was compared with KVRollbackTs during rollback processing.
