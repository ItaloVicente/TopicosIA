As suggested by Jeelan, I had converted it to sparse logging (log only once per 100 errors - per vbucket). That would be good to isolate some of the problems. Let me know if you think we need "always-ON" logging.

As these are protocol violations, we could log all of these. Unless there is a serious bug, these exceptions shouldn't happen. Also, we can make the loglevel Fatal, as system test monitors and flags all Fatal errors in the logs, so we don't miss any of these.
