DESCRIPTION:

MB-39154 Force fetch cluster info cache on every call to RetrievePlanFromClsuter

Updating cluster info cache from streaming endpoint and operations
like Rebalance are both asyncronous in nature. It is possible that
while Rebalance is triggerred, cluster info cache is not yet updated
(i.e. a notification is yet to be received from ns_server). This can
result in stale cluster info and therefore can lead to failure in
rebalance operations

Force fetch cluster info cache once every time RetrievePlanFromCluster
is called. This will ensure that cluster info cache at planner has the
latest values and does not affect cluster wide operations like Rebalance
