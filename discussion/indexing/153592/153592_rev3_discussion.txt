DESCRIPTION:

MB-45743 Part 2: Eliminate panics during snapshot persistence

memdb.go Visitor() method had explicit panics in three places, none of
which needed to be panics. The first of these (for nil snap *Snapshot
passed in) probably never could occur, but the second and third (for
inability to open an iterator on the snapshot) could occur based on
the timing of the persistence work: if the snapshot got closed just
before snapshot persistence tried to open an iterator on it,
NewIterator would not open an iterator and the Visitor() method would
explicitly call panic. This happened from the following call sequence:

1. memdb_slice_impl.go OpenSnapshot() - calls Open() on s, which is
   the type memdbSnapshot grandparent of the snapshot, incrementing
   the grandparent's refCount but not the actual snapshot's refCount.
   The actual snapshot is s.info.MainSnap (type memdb.Snapshot) and
   has its own separate refCount field which is not incremented here.
2. memdb_slice_impl.go doPersistSnapshot()
3. memdb.go StoreToDisk()
4. memdb.go Visitor() - panics when NewIterator() returns nil
5. memdb/iterator.go NewIterator() - returns nil because snap.Open()
   returned false.
6. memdb.go Snapshot.Open() - returns false because it sees the actual
   snapshot's refCount == 0, meaning the snapshot is already closed
   and possibly garbage collected.

The fix is to change the panics to normal error returns, which will
cause persistence to be skipped for the dead snapshot. I also renamed
Visitor() to visitor() since it has no external callers.

Patch Set 3:

John and Akhil -- Deep does not have time to review this today and asked me to add you both. I believe the current patch is safe and important hygiene for production systems not to have intentional panics instead of errors where possible. One of these panics was hit in QE testing. What this patch does is change the three possible intentional panics if attempting to persist a snapshot that has already been closed to just logged errors and skipping the persisting of this snapshot. It definitely can't continue as the snapshot has already been put on the GC list.

There may still be another problem to find that caused the explicit panic to be reached, e.g. the snapshot is being persisted in one go routine, but if the decision to close it when done is from another go routine without a synchronization mechanism, events may not occur in the expected order.
