Line:982, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> May be I don't understand the question.

Here, after the code change, we will wait until (1) StopSchedCreateToken is posted, OR (2) DeleteCommandToken is posted (3) Index metadata is observed with state ACTIVE or DELETED. Line 914 on the right hand side (above) ensures that for non-deferred indexes.

So, for both deferred and non-deferred indexes, we will wait until the expected state is observed. 

This is done for keeping behaviour same between synchronous and background index creation.
https://github.com/couchbase/indexing/blob/master/secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go#L1189

The idea is: User should be able to start scanning the index immediately after successful "create index" command.

Line:982, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> I am trying to understand the impact of removing code from line 968 - 995 on the left side.

Line:982, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> Before this code change, we used to check for existence of ScheduleCreateToken. Once the index is created, the token will get removed from metakv. So, for both deferred and non-deferred indexes, the the first notification will be received due to token cleanup.

So, for non-deferred indexes, there was a need to wait for second notification.

The problem was: the SheduleCreateToken can get deleted due to index deletion as well. And there was no way to separately identifying these two events (i.e. index creation or deletion). So, the second wait was needed.

Not, after introducing 24 hours delay in deleteCommandToken cleanup, we can just check for deleteCommandToken and no need to rely on absence of ScheduleCreateToken. And - in new code - a single notification takes care of all use cases except for keyspace change. Hence, another patch to stop waiting after keyspace change.
