DESCRIPTION:

MB-55505 Change default config for minVbQueueLength

The default of 250 for minVbQueueLength means that 250 mutations can be
enqueued for each vbucket regardless of the memory consumed by the mutation
queue. With large number of buckets, this unregulated memory usage can quickly
add up as each bucket has its own mutation queue allocation.

The heap memory consumed by queued up mutations is better utilized in
storage engine. This change reduces the default to 50.

smallSnapshotThreshold also needs to be adjusted accordingly as it is
dependant on minVbQueueLength. It has been changed to 30.

Looks like we are undoing the change from https://review.couchbase.org/c/indexing/+/154921 where smallSnapshotThreshold for init stream was increased as snapshots can be larger due to the collection model. 

AFAIU, If we change this back to the old value we will get bigger snapshots in init stream and we will not align them and get non aligned snapshots where we cannot merge and this increasing the merge time. Please correct me if i am wrong. I see that we dont do this alignment if we get a OSO Marker for a vbucket.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Actually we figured out later that the problem was with the document generator in the system test where it was only generating mutations for 1-2 vbuckets leading to very big snapshots. The same thing would happen in a bucket model as well if used with the skewed data generator. 30 is a reasonable choice which has worked well in production.
