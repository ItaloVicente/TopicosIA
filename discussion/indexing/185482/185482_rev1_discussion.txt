DESCRIPTION:

MB-55190 checkDuplicateIndex only if rebalance is not running

If the m.acceptedNames map is updated first and then rebalance
is found to be running, then the map is not cleared until timeout
happens (which is 3 min) by default. During this time, index
creation would fail with duplicate index name inspite of index
not existing in the cluster.

To address the issue, the checkDuplicateIndex happens only if
rebalance is not found to be running. Also, on CANCEL_PREPARE,
the entry from m.acceptedNames map is cleared to prevent any
memory leak.
