DESCRIPTION:

MB-54678 Unlock shards on source after replica repair in rebalance

During replica repair, indexes on source node should not be
dropped. However, all the data that is transferred to S3 should
be cleaned up and the corresponding shards have to be unlocked.
Otherwise, new index creation after replica repair will fail
due to shards being locked.

This patch addresses the issue by cleaning up the transferred
data and unlocking the shards after replica repair case.
