DESCRIPTION:

MB-18858 Skip recovery response after stream cleanup

As part of stream cleanup in timekeeper, repair attempt in KVSender is aborted.
But there can be a case where the repair response has already been sent
from KVSender and is in-flight when cleanup happens in timekeeper.
Such a response needs to be skipped in timekeeper.
