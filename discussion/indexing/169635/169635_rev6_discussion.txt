DESCRIPTION:

MB-50323: Implement indexer adminport auth functions

Indexing code uses gometa library for adminport client server
communication. The gometa library accepts authentication function
for client as well as server, as parameter and calls it.

The gometa server protocol enforces following steps before
registering a watcher as a client.

1. Client sends follower info to server
2. Server responds with leader info, including epoch, to the client.
3. Client sends epoch acknoledgement to the server.
4. Server synchronises the metadata with client.
5. Server sends new leader message to the client.
6. Client responds with new leader acknlowledgement.

The first two steps in above protocol represent a blocking
request -> response call. So, upgrade handling becomes easy.

Server:
- Enforces auth when the cluster is completely upgraded.
- During upgrade, server allows unauthenticated connections.
- Server always responds to auth request with auth response.

Client:
- Sends auth request only if the cluster is completely upgraded.

If client does not observe the version upgrade before server,
client can send follower info by ignoring the auth. In that case,
server will reject the request and close the connection. The
client will then retry with new connection, after exponential
backoff, starting from 1 sec, capped at 30 seconds.
