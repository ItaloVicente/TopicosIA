DESCRIPTION:

MB-33546 (7.1.0 1206) Smart Batching for Rebalance feature

During rebalance, publish transfer tokens incrementally according to a
dynamically adapting algorithm that improves rebalance performance by
  1. Using the hardware more evenly and fully
  2. Engendering more DCP stream sharing
  3. Ordering builds to smooth out the workload and maximize parallelism

For details see the spec:

Patch Set 1:

Deep -- to get past merge conflicts in rebalancer.go with Yogendra's MB-46883 I had to cherry pick the last patch set 12 from build 1116 (http://review.couchbase.org/c/indexing/+/158774/12) which becomes patch set 1 on build 1206 here, then manually resolve about 3 lines of merge conflicts.

You had already +2ed the review of this in the 1116 build. If you would be so kind as to +2 patch set 1 here, that would be great. (Note 1116 is now on patch set 13 because I edited the commit message to put "1116" in it but there were no new code changes in that patch set.)

There will be further changes in subsequent patch sets on this new build level to deal with MB-48191 "Duplicate partition" error on down-level nodes.
