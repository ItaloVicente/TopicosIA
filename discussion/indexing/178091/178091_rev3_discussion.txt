DESCRIPTION:

MB-53048: Update numSliceWriters as per the cgroup setting

* numSliceWriters is exepected to immutable over the lifetime of indexer
  process and can change over restart
* As cgroup.max_cpu_percent can change over the indexer restart
  numSliceWriters can also change if indexer is restarted
* Currently numSliceWriters does not change with change in
  max_cpu_percent it will only be set to min(cgroup.max_cpu_percent,
  runtime.NumCPU()) during the indexer bootstrap
* If we want numSliceWriters to vary with max_cpu_percent we must check
  if its fine to have this value different for different index slice and
  if we need to pass on the change in numSliceWriters to existing index
  slices or not
* This change is only intended for honouring the cgroups limits
* Immutable field in the ConfigValue does not reject the change in tha
  value even when the field is set to be immutable as of today so this
  value can be changed with REST call
