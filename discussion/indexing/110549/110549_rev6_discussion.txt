DESCRIPTION:

MB-34541: Trigger stats updation from the stats manager

The stats updation was triggered by /stats REST call from ns_server.
Now, it will be triggered by the stats manager (a component
internal to indexing). The fix only changes the "trigger" of stats
updation. Actual logic and interval of stats updation does not change.

Also, allowing stats updater to be run during bootstrap as there is
no reason not to allow it.

Patch Set 6:

With the current patch, the storage manager initialization/initFromPersisted state in indexer can run concurrently with the stats request being sent to storage manager. This may still work today but such subtle things make future changes more error prone. I think we should make the stats manager send stats request messages after bootstrap is done.
