DESCRIPTION:

MB-34541: Trigger stats updation from the stats manager main thread

The stats updation was triggered by /stats REST call. Now, it will
be triggered by the stats manager main thread.

The fix only changes the "trigger" of stats updation. Actual logic and
interval of stats updation does not change.

Can you please explain the motivation behind this change? The /stats is going to be polled by ns-server every 1sec. Is something not happening correctly?

Stats updation and broadcasting of these stats to the queryport client is triggered by ns_server. So, there is external dependency and I think gsi should internally trigger the stats updation and broadcast. So I am removing this external dependency in this patch. 

External dependencies make it difficult to debug the problems in this area.

Line:1544, secondary/indexer/stats_manager.go -> with this change, we loose the ability to change "stats_cache_timeout" without restarting indexer.
