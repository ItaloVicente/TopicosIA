DESCRIPTION:

MB-43994: Fix DCP feed names

It is not required for DCP feed names to contain bucket, scope and
collection names.

With large names of these keyspaces, the DCP feed key size limit can
reach and feed request will be rejected by DCP producer.

Projector does not maintain the feeds based on feed name, but it
maintains the feeder object using keyspace as key.

Projector already guarantees the uniqueness of the feed names by
adding uuid to it.

Feed name based logging is changed to logPrefix based logging.

Patch Set 2:

Instead of moving to logPrefix based logging, we can try to keep the logging at projector unchanged.
However, when opening connections with KV, we can use the stripped version of feed's name i.e. avoid keyspaceId in the name sent to memcached.

This way, with the UUID for each connection, we can easily identify what is happening on memcached without impacting the projector logging.

I kind of agree here. There two things required, on one hand we need eye-ball comfort while surfing through the logs and on the other hand enough detail (like UUID) to precisely connect sequence of event across components.
