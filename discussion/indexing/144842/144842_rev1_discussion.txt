DESCRIPTION:

MB-43994: Fix DCP feed names

It is not required for DCP feed names to contain bucket, scope and
collection names.

With large names of these keyspaces, the DCP feed key size limit can
reach and feed request will be rejected by DCP producer.

Projector does not maintain the feeds based on feed name, but it
maintains the feeder object using keyspace as key.

Projector already guarantees the uniqueness of the feed names by
adding uuid to it.

Feed name based logging is changed to logPrefix based logging.
