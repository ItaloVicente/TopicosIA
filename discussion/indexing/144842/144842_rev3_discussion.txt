DESCRIPTION:

MB-43994: Fix DCP feed names

It is not required for DCP feed names to contain bucket, scope and
collection names. With large names of these keyspaces, the DCP feed
key size limit can reach and feed request will be rejected by DCP
producer.

Projector does not maintain the feeds based on feed name, but it
maintains the feeder object using keyspace as key.

Projector already guarantees the uniqueness of the feed names by
adding uuid to it.

Done. Refactored the code as discussed offline.

> I kind of agree here. There two things required, on one hand we need eye-ball comfort while surfing through the logs and on the other hand enough detail (like UUID) to precisely connect sequence of event across components.

The logging on projector side is (and was) unchanged. But restrucutred the code to avoid changes across multiple layers.

Line:746, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Instead of calling this method twice (here and enableCollections), we can probably call this once when initialising the DCP feed and use that prefix here.

Line:1758, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> I think we can avoid this logic
