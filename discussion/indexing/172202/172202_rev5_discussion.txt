DESCRIPTION:

MB-51349 Block checkInitStreamReadyToMerge while recovery is being initiated

When indexer initiates a recovery on a stream, it expects the stream
to be in active state. However, in some cases (like indexer resuming
from paused state), it is possible for checkInitStreamReadyToMerge to
be invoked, merge the stream and move the stream to inactive state.
When this races with recovery i.e. timekeeper sends INIT_PREP_RECOVERY
message to indexer, checkInitStreamReadyToMerge moves the state to
inactive, timekeeper handles the response to INIT_PREP_RECOVERY
and see the state in inactive state and does nothing. This can lead
to the stream getting stuck. The same issue also exists with
RESET_STREAM message.

One such occurrence is between RESET streams and indexer resume from
paused state in MOI.

RCA: Race condition between reset streams after indexer resume and
generateNewStabilityTS->checkInitStreamReadyToMerge causes indexer
to set stream status to STREAM_PREPARE_RECOVERY where as timekeeper
merges the stream and sets stream status to INACTIVE. Due to this
recovery in progress, indexer resume does not work.

Fix: Does not allow stream merge until TK initiated stream reset/recovery
is complete, once stream reset/recovery is complete stream merge will be
evaluated again.
