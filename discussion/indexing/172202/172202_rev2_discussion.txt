DESCRIPTION:

MB-51349 EKS Cluster: Mem_optimized: Indexes not become ready after increasing the quota

RCA: Race condition between reset streams after indexer resume and generateNewStabilityTS->checkInitStreamReadyToMerge causes indexer to set stream status to STREAM_PREPARE_RECOVERY where as timekeeper merges the stream and sets stream status to INACTIVE. Due to this recovery in progress, indexer resume does not work.
Fix: Does not allow stream merge until stream reset after resume is complete, once stream reset is complete stream merge will be evaluated again.

Line:2168, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> It is better to not reset this flag here. checkPendingStreamMerge can again be possibly triggered before recovery starts. This flag will get reset in Timekeeper.initiateRecovery along with all the bookkeeping. Also, it would be good to set this flag at all places sending the INDEXER_INIT_PREP_RECOVERY message to indexer. Once INDEXER_INIT_PREP_RECOVERY has been sent, this race condition can get triggered if stream merge check succeeds.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks Deep, I will work on comments. I had added this reset here because I thought there are some cases where the flag will not be reset - especially if there is existing recovery running and this recovery gets canceled due to it. But if we add the flag to all places as you have suggested that wont be a concern. 
Line:2168, secondary/indexer/timekeeper.go -> Ack
