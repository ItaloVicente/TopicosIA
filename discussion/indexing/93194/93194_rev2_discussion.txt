DESCRIPTION:

MB-28139: Don't fail indexer bootstrap if index storage is corrupted.

I.
Detect the storage corruption and handle it gracefully. If storage
is corrupt for an index (or a partition of an index):
(1) Don't make it available
(2) Cleanup its data
(3) Notify the administrator about the corruption and cleanup.

II.
This allows availability of non-corrupted indices.

III.
Allow DeleteOrPruneIndexInstance during bootstrap

IV.
For MOI, detect disk corruption in NewStorageManager. Store the fact
persistently in error file and let indexer exit. Once the indexer
restarts, check for presence of error file during NewSlice. If there
was a corrution error, cleanup the index partition.
