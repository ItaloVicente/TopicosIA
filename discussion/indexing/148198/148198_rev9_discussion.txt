Line:109, secondary/projector/memmanager/manager.go -> This is a stop-the-world call for golang runtime. If this is called every 5secs, this can lead to perf degradation. e.g. on a 100GB box, it is normal for memcached to take 60GB.

Line:116, secondary/projector/memmanager/manager.go -> Comparing heapIdle with heapAlloc is tricky. (heapIdle - heapReleased) would give the memory which is actually idle.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:109, secondary/projector/memmanager/manager.go -> Updated the patch to:

a. Maintain two sample histories of projector RSS -
   i. For shorter duration of time (4 samples)
  ii. For longer duration of time (12 samples)
b. If the average of shorter duration is 10% greater than average of longer duration, memmanager would read memstats and then decide to take an action to call freeOSMemory call

Also, the threshold to check memstats is increased to projector RSS > 16% of total memory. This is because, at projectorRSS = 10% of total memory , DCP feeds would slowdown mutation ingestion and that should resolve memory issues to some extent. Even after that, if memory keeps on increasing, only then projector attempts to take more severe actions
