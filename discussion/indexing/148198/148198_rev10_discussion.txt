Line:135, secondary/projector/memmanager/manager.go -> Let's say RSS was 10GB in the last 11 samples and spiked to 15GB(50% spike) in 12th. LMA would be 10.41. SMA would be 11.25(which is less than 10% greater than LMA). Though the actual RSS spike is 50%. A moving average can be better at capturing the spikes.

Line:135, secondary/projector/memmanager/manager.go -> Hey Deep, I thought about moving average as well before considering this implementation. When the rate of change is slow, moving average might not catch it. 

E.g., let's say that last 10 samples are 10G and indexer RSS slowly increases by 1G for 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th samples. The moving averages for corresponding samples are as under:

11th sample: (10 + 11)/2 = 10.5
12th sample: (10.5+12)/2 = 11.25
13th sample: (11.25 + 13)/2 = 12.125
14th sample: (12.125 + 14)/2 = 13.0625
14th sample: (13.06125 + 15)/2 = 14.03125

There won't be any 10% difference if we just consider current and previous moving average when the RSS is slowly changing. That problem won't happen with this implementation because after 

11th sample: SMA: (3*10+11)/4 = 10.25, LMA: (9*10+11)/10 = 10.1
12th sample: SMA: (2*10 + 11 + 12)/4 = 10.75, LMA: (8*10 + 11 + 12)/10 = 10.3
13th sample: SMA: (10 + 11 + 12 + 13)/4 = 11.5, LMA: (7 * 10 + 11 + 12 + 13)/10 = 10.6
14th sample: SMA: (11 + 12 + 13 + 14)/4 = 12.5, LMA: (6 * 10 + 11 + 12 + 13 + 14)/10 = 11 -> Action will be taken


Now, coming to the example you mentioned, if RSS spiked to 15G, SMA is 10.41. We may not take a decision at that instance but the next sample determines the action to be taken.

E.g, 11th sample is 15G. Atfter 11th sample, SMA: (3 * 10 + 15)/4=11.25, LMA = (9*10 + 15) = 10.5 -> No action

If at 12th sample, RSS increased to 16G, then SMA: (2*10 + 15 + 16)/4 = 12.75, LMA = (8 * 10 + 15 + 16)/10 = 11.1 -> Takes action

If at 12th sample, RSS does not change, then SMA: (2*10 + 15 + 15)/4 = 12.5, LMA: (8 * 10 + 15 + 15)/10 = 11, action will be taken

If at 12th sample, RSS comes down to 13G, then SMA: (2*10 + 15 + 13)/4 = 12, LMA: (8 * 10 + 15 + 13)/10 = 10.8, action will be taken

If at 12th sample, RSS comes down to 10G, then SMA: (2*10 + 15 + 10)/4 = 11.25, LMA: (8 * 10 + 15 + 10)/10 = 10.5, No action will be taken

This scheme seems to allow both slowly and fast growing RSS. It may not handle a spike where there was one but it would eventually handle it if RSS does not come under control.
