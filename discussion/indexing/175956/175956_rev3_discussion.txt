DESCRIPTION:

MB-52256 Pre-compute DDL running before validation for bootstrap

a. When a indexer service is added to the cluster, ns_server
   waits for 60 seconds for the indexer to register itself
   as a topology aware service. If indexer does not register
   in 60 seconds, rebalance would fail
b. In MB-46320, we noticed a case where closeAllStreams() was
   taking more than 60 seconds and indexer could not register
   itself as a topology aware service - Successive restarts
   would work though.
c. To avoid the issue, large part of the bootstrap1 phase is
   made asyncronous - This is done to allow indexer to register
   itself as a topology aware service with in 60 seconds
d. In MB-52256, a new problem is seen - Indexer panicked as
   indexer's checkDDLInProgress that gets triggered during
   PrepareTopologyChange phase and async bootstrap1 are
   reading and writing to the same map
e. The intent behind PrepareTopologyChange to check DDL in progress
   is to fail rebalance in StartTopologyChange phase if any DDLs are
   running when index rebalance phase starts
f. For this to happen, PrepareTopologyChange should check DDL in
   progress only after index instance map is recovered as we will
   know the status of on-going DDL's during bootstrap from the
   index states in indexInstMap
g. Due to the fix in MB-46320, it is possible for PrepareTopologyChange
   to happen even before recoverIndexInstMap method is executed
   while there are indexes in INITIAL or CATCHUP state - This would
   violate the pre-condition that rebalance and DDL are not supported
   together
h. To avoid the issue, this patch fixes it by recovering the
   indexInstMap before registering as a topology aware service. Since
   the timeout for registering at ns_server and response to
   PrepareTopologyChange call is 60 seconds (at ns_server), indexer
   will not loose much by moving this "recoverIndexInstMap" method
   out of the go-routine
i. After recovering the index instance map, indexer will check for
   any on-going DDL's even before registering as topology aware
   service so that PrepareTopologyChange does not have to iterate
   through indexInstMap to know this information. This will protect
   indexInstMap from concurrent read/write operations
