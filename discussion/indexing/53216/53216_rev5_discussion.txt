DESCRIPTION:

MB-15679 Handle GenServer.Closed response from projector

The newly introduced GenServer.Closed response from projector needs
similar treatment as topicMissing. Once this response has been seen,
delInst/delBucket/closeTopic calls can assume success. restartVb needs
to fallback to MTR as topic is already gone.
