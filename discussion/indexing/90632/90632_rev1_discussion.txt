DESCRIPTION:

MB-28420: Partitioned indexes on MOI : Very high mem usage

Derive the diskBlockSize as a function of the indexer's RAM quota
This is to avoid memory bloat when there are a lot of partitioned
indexes but the indexer RAM quota is small.

Since we use fs cache for the writes, the buffer size may not have much impact on write performance since the fs may be caching it anyway. We could simply set the default buffer size to 4KB and see if there is any regression in performance. 

Another approach:
The key reason why memory bloat happens is that we schedule all the persistors concurrently. We have another bug open to restrict the concurrent persistor threads. If we fix that, this problem would go away. If we restrict the maximum concurrent threads equal to numCPUs, then maximum memory used will be numCPU*512KB. Currently, we also allocate the number of shard files equal to the number of cpus for fast recovery. Even when the concurrent threads is low (eg., 2), we allocate number of buffers equal to number of cpus. We can optimize StoreToDisk function to allocate buffer only when the back goroutine is created to avoid extra buffers being allocated.

Thanks Sarath, for this fix, I will try setting buffer size to 4K to see if there is any regression.
And as a separate commit address the cpu based scaling. Does that sound ok?
