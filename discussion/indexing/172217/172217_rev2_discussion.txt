DESCRIPTION:

MB-51371: Return emtpy array when local KV has no vb for bucket

* In case ephemeral buckets when mcd crashes the active vbuckets are not
  restored automatically and recovered kv does does not have any active
  vbuckets.
* Vbno32to16 in getLocalVBuckets earlier used to convert nil array to
  emtpty array and Vbno32to16 was removed to have avoid mutiple conversions
  when integrating cinfo lite
* SelectByVbuckets selects all the vbuckets when input is nil. So
  projector is trying to find owner of all the vbuckets when KV owns none
* Fix is to return empty array in place of nil so that no vbuckets are
  selected in SelectByVbuckets as it was being done internally in Vbno32to16
