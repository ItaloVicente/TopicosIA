DESCRIPTION:

MB-52931 Control logging in builder when processing build tokens during rebalance

As build tokens can exist in metaKV for longer duration of time and
builder will consider to process build tokens even when defn is
not found in local repo (as the bucket can still be in rebalance),
reduce the amount of logging to prevent log flooding.
