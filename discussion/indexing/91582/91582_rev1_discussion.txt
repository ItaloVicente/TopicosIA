DESCRIPTION:

MB-28597: Optimize ExplodeArray for groups aggregates for a wide index

As part of scan request processing, gather list of explode positions
and decode positions needed for ExplodeArray function which is used
in composite filtering and groups and aggregates pushdowns. Aggregates
on initial set of composite keys on a relatively wider index benfit
from this code change.

Result from laptop test with 1M docs:
create index i1 on default(age, company, `first-name`, phone, address.pin, friends)
select SUM(age) from default where age is not null GROUP BY age, company

Before: Throughput = 57931 rows/sec "Rows":5109100,"Duration":88.19
After:  Throughput = 67567 rows/sec "Rows":5109100,"Duration":75.61

Line:1094, secondary/indexer/scan_request.go -> Can this be done using the prior 'for' loops?

Line:1273, secondary/indexer/scan_request.go -> Dont we need capture explodeUpto here as well?

Line:1094, secondary/indexer/scan_request.go -> This looks into both explodePositions and decodePositions. Also we may process explodePositions in multiple places:
Composite Filter code path, Index Projection code path and
Group By Aggr code path. Hence thought its easier to do a sweep towards end.

Line:1273, secondary/indexer/scan_request.go -> explodeUpto is capture at once in setExplodePositions finally after this function.
