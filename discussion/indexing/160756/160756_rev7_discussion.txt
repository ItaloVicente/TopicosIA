DESCRIPTION:

MB-33546 (7.1.0 1238) Smart Batching for Rebalance feature

During rebalance, publish transfer tokens incrementally according to a
dynamically adapting algorithm that improves rebalance performance by
  1. Using the hardware more evenly and fully
  2. Engendering more DCP stream sharing
  3. Ordering builds to smooth out the workload and maximize parallelism

Patch Set 7: Code-Review+2

This feature was reviewed earlier, before being cherry picked forward to 7.1.0 build 1238. Only a few minor tweaks have been done since then to add logging and to prevent triggering MB-48191 on down-level nodes in a mixed-level cluster. set14_rebalance_test.out passed ~700 times in a row over ~90 hours on laptop + many runs on CI Bot for Neo code level. With the final fix for down-level cluster, it has passed 26 runs in a row on laptop hacked to force down-level codepath. Down-level problems before this fix occurred very frequently, at least once in every 3-4 runs.

Consensus in GSI scrum yesterday was this feature could be delivered even without a down-level fix, which could come later. However, now that is fixed as well by patchset 6 of this change set. Delivering to unstable branch with no known problems outstanding.
