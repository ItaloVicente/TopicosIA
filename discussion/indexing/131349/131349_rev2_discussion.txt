DESCRIPTION:

Use collection aware Seqnos for consistent scans

A global cluster version is maintained which keeps a track
of the cluster version when a connection to KV is made.

The GetSeqnos() API uses this global cluster version when
trying to decide between calling CollectionSeqnos() (or)
BucketSeqnos(). Since all indexes from version >= 7.0
will be defined on collections, it would call CollectionSeqnos()
for a upgraded cluster.

This patch is based on the fact that when a KV node leaves the
cluster, the FetchSeqnos() call would return an error and the
connections will be cleaned-up and established again during the
next call to BucketSeqnos()/ CollectionSeqnos().

Similarly, when a KV node joins the cluster,  pollForDeletedBuckets()
would lazy detect rebalance and cleanup the connections. The next
call to BucketSeqnos()/CollectionSeqnos() would re-establish the
connections again.

The cluster version is updated when re-establishing the connections.
