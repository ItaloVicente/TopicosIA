DESCRIPTION:

MB-39658 Do not broadcast list of indexes if there is no change
in list of indexes or buckets

The protocol is as follows:
a. When a watcher starts, it sends a message to indexer and get's
the client stats and caches them
b. From then on, when ever watcher gets stats, it checks if the map
of index names is empty or not
c. If the map is empty, then it will retrieve the name of indexes
from the cached client stats
d. Otherwise, watcher will update the cached client stats with
the index names present in the broadcasted message

Line:5100, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> When will this case be true?

Line:5100, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> Lifecycle manager when broadcasts stats, checks if there is any change in list of indexes for any bucket. If there is no change in list of indexes across all buckets, then it would not broadcast this list (see: LifecycleMgr::GetDiffFromLastSent in this patch). Otherwise, lifecycle manager would broadcast list of all indexes across all buckets. So, this condition would be true when there is no change in list of indexes on indexer side.

Line:5100, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> I see. Does the cache here need to be cleared if indexes get dropped on the server and as a result broadcasted list doesn't have indexes?

Line:5100, secondary/manager/client/metadata_provider.go -> It gets cleared automatically. Lifecycle manager follows the send all or send none policy i.e. it sends list of indexes even if one index across all buckets gets dropped or gets added. 

For example, consider 2 buckets: B1 with indexes I1, I2 and B2 with indexes I3, I4.

Now, if B1:I2 is deleted, then lifecycle manager would send a broadcast message with B1:I1 and B2:[I3,I4] and the cache gets updated with B1:I1 and B2:[I3,I4]

If B1:I1 is also deleted, then lifecycle manager broadcast message would not contain anything related to B1 - as no indexes existed in B1. Lifecycle manager would broadcast only B2:[I3,I4] and the cache would get updated to contain B2:[I3,I4]

When both the indexes of B2 are also deleted, then lifecycle manager would send an empty map. In that case, this for loop does not get executed and useCached becomes false. As useCached is false, the if condition at line 5137 gets triggered and client get's updated with empty indexStats2 map thereby clearing the cached client stats.
