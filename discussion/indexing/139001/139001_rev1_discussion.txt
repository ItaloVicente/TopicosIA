DESCRIPTION:

MB-41410 Pro-actively close the memcached connection when there
is a write error

When there is a connection closure from memcached and projector
does npt see that yet, then writing buffer ack will fail. In such
cases, close the connection with memcached instead of waiting for
projector to get notified on connection closure

Abandoned

Not required as memcached has increased the socket buffer timeout to 6min which correlates with DCP buffer ack timeout
