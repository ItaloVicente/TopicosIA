DESCRIPTION:

MB-37708: Add infra to get collection sequence numbers in common package

Modify existing infram to implement dispatcher-workers based model
for batching per-collection sequence numbers (design available in design doc)

Introduce two new APIs for getting collection level sequence numbers.
The four APIs now available are:

BucketSeqnos
CollectionSeqnos
BucketMinSeqnos
CollectionMinSeqnos

Also rename CollectSeqnos and CollectMinSeqnos to FetchSeqnos and FetchMinSeqnos
to avoid confusion in naming.

Currently the number of workers is fixed. It might be made configurable in a
later patch.

Line:134, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> This should be dealt in fetchSeqnos() as it is not advisable to close a channel on receiver side. Otherwise, this routine might panic

Line:280, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> Same comment as above

Line:343, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> Same as above

Line:411, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> While this code will not be executed, I would suggest to have a clean close method for all the new vbSeqnosReader. May be call close() here

Line:134, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> Why will the routine panic? I am receiving with an ok check. It should not panic.

Line:280, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> This is needed to stop processMinSeqNos. I did not understand the concern here

Line:343, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> What is the concern here?

Line:411, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> This code is very much executed, hence the clean up

Line:411, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> In fact this is the right place to do the clean up as kvfeeds are used in this goroutine, hence need to be cleaned up when this routine is exiting.

Line:134, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> I get your concern about internalCh. Yes that should be closed in the other routine

Line:280, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> Will this channel close to the main routine of Dispatcher

Line:343, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> Actually there is no issue with requestCh as no one is expected to send on a closed reader. However, workerRespCh has to close after all workers are done
