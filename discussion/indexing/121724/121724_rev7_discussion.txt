DESCRIPTION:

MB-37708: Add infra to get collection sequence numbers in common package

Modify existing infra to implement dispatcher-workers based model
for batching per-collection sequence numbers (design available in design doc)

Introduce two new APIs for getting collection level sequence numbers.
The four APIs now available are:

BucketSeqnos
CollectionSeqnos
BucketMinSeqnos
CollectionMinSeqnos

Also rename CollectSeqnos and CollectMinSeqnos to FetchSeqnos and FetchMinSeqnos
to avoid confusion in naming.

Currently the number of workers is fixed. It might be made configurable in a
later patch.

Also, did you get a chance to run this new infra with a request_plus test to see how the perf compares with the existing one?
Line:138, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> It is more appropriate to switch the order of the defers so that  wg.Done is the last statement to be executed after everything else got cleaned up.

Line:181, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> better to send workerId and clear dispatchermap if workerId matches.

Line:279, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> if lets say 5th worker getKVFeeds run into error, how will the kvfeeds of the preceeding 4 workers get cleaned up?

Line:359, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> as a matter of good practice, it is always advisable to close a channel in sender rather than receiver. why not just close requestCh in Close() method rather than having a donech and break the loop in the else part?

Line:498, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> name can be removed. Not being used.

Line:505, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> fix logging.

Line:581, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> name can be removed.

Line:373, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> Q: Can this lead to non-uniform load distribution ?

Line:390, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> What if

worker #3 starts processing collection c1, then c2 gets queued up with same worker #3 (because of randomness) and then  next request for c1 also gets queued up with worker #3. Now, on first response, we will remove c1 from the dispatcherMap. But there will be next req/batch for c1. So the bookkeeping goes wrong. 

I don't think this will have any big functional impact though.

Line:138, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> That was the intent Deep, the order got missed. Thanks !

Line:181, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> Yes, I will do that Deep, its part of my TODO

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:359, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> currently, break of loop happens when donech is closed. requestCh and minSeqReqCh are the last ones to close. 
The reason I thought of this approach is, senders for requestCh are independent routines that invoke common's BucketSeqnos. since Close() is not sender and it is not possible to close the channel in actual senders, perhaps, it is better to close these channels as the last step of reader's closing.

Line:373, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> It can if we want to do batching based on collection ids. I can think about whether random distribution is a good alternate

Line:390, secondary/common/dcp_seqno.go -> As discussed offline, this is not an issue. The list size is checked before sending done msg to dispatcher
