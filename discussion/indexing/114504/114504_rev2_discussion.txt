DESCRIPTION:

MB-35880 fix restart timestamp calculation for rollback

during rollback, the disk snapshots across indexes/partitions could
be ahead/behind of each other due to:
a. disk snapshots may happen at different times for different indexes
   or partitions as it is async.
b. during stream merge, the snapshot from INIT stream could be ahead
   of snapshot in MAINT stream.

Due to this, it is important to calculate the minimum common timestamp
across indexes/partitons which could be used to restart the stream.
