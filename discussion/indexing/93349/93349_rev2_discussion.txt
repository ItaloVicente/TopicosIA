DESCRIPTION:

MB-27861: Optimize MIN, MAX aggregate without group by

Set a flag FirstValidAggrOnly in scan request based on rules
laid out in the bug.
During pipeline execution, in every row processing, check the flag
and if the aggregate is valid, stop the storage scanning

Aggregate is considered valid as follows:
MIN / MAX: First non-null, non-missing value
COUNT: when the count reaches 1

Local cbindexperf test with 1M items, scan for MIN of leading key:
./cbindexperf -cluster 127.0.0.1:9000 -configfile config2.json -resultfile result2.json

Before: Throughput = 8 rows/sec
After:  Throughput = 10596 rows/sec
