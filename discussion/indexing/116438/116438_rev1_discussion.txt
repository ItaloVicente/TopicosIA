DESCRIPTION:

Force GC aggressively when indexer is in paused state

As per the current logic, if indexer moves to PAUSED state when using MOI
and the indexer memory used comes down to between 80%-90% of memory quota,
indexer waits for the memory used to accumulate and go beyond 90% of memory
quota to trigger a GC.

When there is a data drop while indexer memory used is between 80%-90%, then
indexer might not come out of PAUSED state immediately as indexer waits for
memory used to cross 90%.

In this patch, we aggressively force GC when indexer is in PAUSED state
