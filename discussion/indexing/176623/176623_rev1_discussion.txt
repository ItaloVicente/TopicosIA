File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Previously GoInstall() targets depended on all earlier-defined GoInstall() targets - this was done to prevent multiple Go compiles happening at once. Recently this was changed when using the Ninja build tool; now it uses a Ninja job pool to prevent multiple Go compiles happening at once. This eliminated the serial dependencies on all GoInstall() targets, which revealed that several required target dependencies, mostly on query's n1ql-yacc target, were missing. This led to race conditions in parallel builds, causing sporadic production build failures on Windows which uses Ninja. You could also reliably cause a build failure by starting on a clean build and invoking, say, "ninja cbindex" - this would fail because the n1ql-yacc target wasn't run.

I've added those dependencies where necessary, and also moved all dependencies into the DEPENDS clause of GoInstall() rather than using a separate ADD_DEPENDENCIES() step, so that they're all declared consistently.
