DESCRIPTION:

[Backport to 6.0.4] MB-36903: Increment definition versions of index during MoveIndex

If version is not incremented during transfer token generation as
part of move index, it leads to incorrect metadata book-keeping
in metadata provider client as new index instance information
replaces old one as they have same versions. Incrementing definition
Versions ensures partition version is updated correctly leading
correct book-keeping of index topology in metadata provider.
