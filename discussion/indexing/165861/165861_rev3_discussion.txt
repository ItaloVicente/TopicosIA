DESCRIPTION:

MB-49326: [System Test] Seeing indexer crash with error - "IndexScanSource - panic detected while processing defnId..."

During the bootstrap indexes loading from persisted state, which adds an index instance to scan co-ordinator but here updating stats happens only after all instances are finished loading with storage warmup done event. As an effect request.stats pointer is nil from the time instance is added to scan coordinator and the update_index_inst message is recieved by scan coordinator after all indexes are recovered from persisted state. If a scan comes in this window with stale=ok consistency it will panic trying to update stats which is nil.
Fix: update stats for the instance as part of add_index_inst message to scan co-ordinator.
