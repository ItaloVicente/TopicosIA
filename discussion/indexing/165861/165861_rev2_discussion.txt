DESCRIPTION:

MB-49326: [System Test] Seeing indexer crash with error - "IndexScanSource - panic detected while processing defnId..."

During the bootstrap indexes loading from persisted state, which adds an index instance to scan co-ordinator but here updating stats happens only after all instances are finished loading with storage warmup done event. As an effect request.stats pointer is nil from the time instance is added to scan coordinator and the update_index_inst message is recieved by scan coordinator after all indexes are recovered from persisted state. If a scan comes in this window with stale=ok consistency it will panic trying to update stats which is nil.
Fix: update stats for the instance as part of add_index_inst message to scan co-ordinator.

> Earlier I thought it was introduced with https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-45484, but it is a day-1 issue. Code prior to MB-45484 also only sets the instance map and not the stats. When indexer restarts and is loading indexes from disk but before storage warmup is complete any incoming stale=ok queries customer will see some scans failing (assuming there is no replica). Depending on the number of indexes to load this could be window of say couple of minutes to 20 mins(i am assuming we will finish in 20 mins). After the storage warmup is complete the issue will go away without any action from customer. Since in production setup customer will have replicas and problem is more pronounced on 7.x with we supporting 10k indexes, i think we should backport to 7.x but do not see strict need to backport to 6.x.

sorry dont know why few minutes back i thought its a day one issue, my earlier analysis was right older code used to send stats along with instance map update so 7.x and 6.x are not affected, it did get introduced with https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-45484

Line:1087, secondary/indexer/scan_coordinator.go -> I would recommend a minor comment that the stats object is lock protected and it is safe to update the stats just for instance without cloning the entire object. This will avoid any confusion around the safety of the update
