Line:472, secondary/tests/functionaltests/indexoperations_test.go -> What is the consistency level of this query? The deletes may not get to the indexer by the time the query gets executed.

Line:472, secondary/tests/functionaltests/indexoperations_test.go -> You can use request_plus consistency in the query instead of sleep.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:472, secondary/tests/functionaltests/indexoperations_test.go -> Yes. You are right. KV might receive the delete request but may not delete all the documents by the time we execute the N1QL query.

I have added a sleep of 15 seconds after this statement to make sure that deletes go to the indexer.
