I have asked a few questions. I will need one more round of review.
Line:1164, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Q: doScan() has different sorts of retries, do we want the retries here as well ?

Line:1182, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Q: Do we need https in case of node-to-node encryption enabled?

Line:159, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> Q: In case of node-to-node encryption enabled, does this request go to https port ?

Line:616, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> Q: Does primary index require secondaryIndex4?

Line:1236, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> Q: Is cbq checking for forestdb ? Or we need to handle for forestdb ?

Line:371, secondary/tests/framework/secondaryindex/n1qlclient.go -> Why this err != nil check ?

Line:1164, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> I will add retry until all replicas exhausted.

Line:1182, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> Thanks for raising this point. Let me think about it.

Line:159, secondary/queryport/client/meta_client.go -> Thanks for raising this point. Let me think about it.

Line:616, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> Yes it is needed. Will add, thanks Amit.

Line:1236, secondary/queryport/n1ql/secondary_index.go -> Currently N1QL does not have storage mode for FDB. I have requested Bingjie to add it. Until it is added, I am returning error.

Line:371, secondary/tests/framework/secondaryindex/n1qlclient.go -> This is supposed to be error check for client.IndexByName line. I will move it .

Line:1182, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> I had earlier seen that security package takes care of this. Will double check

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1164, secondary/queryport/client/client.go -> I have logic for excludes based replica retry but based on discussion with John, its better to keep StorageStatistics API simple by not having replica based retry (which is needed for scan case).
