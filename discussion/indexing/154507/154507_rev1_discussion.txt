DESCRIPTION:

MB-46489 Prevent multiple Rebalancers (MB-45553 regression)

MB-45553 Part 2 changed StartTopologyChange() to no longer hold the mu
mutex write locked during the function. This opened a timing window
where multiple Rebalancer objects could be created if more than one
Rebalance/MoveIndex or Failover request came in close together, as the
test for m.rebalancer != nil was no longer done under the same mu
session as the later assignment m.rebalancer = NewRebalancer(). If this
occurred, only a reference to the last one assigned would be kept, and
multiple Rebalancer objects could be doing work concurrently, which is
against the architectural design. One problem arising from this is that
a Cancel() call could only cancel the last one saved to m.rebalancer,
which was the presenting symptom in the current MB.

The fix is to revert the mu mutex change in this function so it once
again holds mu write locked for the whole function. This will not impact
the related fixes that made GetTaskList() and GetCurrentTopology() more
responsive, as those no longer need the mu mutex at all.
