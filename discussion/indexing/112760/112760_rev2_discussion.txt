DESCRIPTION:

MB-35355: Fix panic handling in Transform Route

In TransformRoute, when recovered from panic, the
error is not returned to the caller. If panic
happens before "data" is populated, the worker will
not send the upsert deletions to the endpoint (which
is the expectation in case of panic recovery and
errors).

I think we need to file an MB to:
1. Have a better mechanism to report these errors rather than log and silently skip.
2. In case of any panic, UpsertDeletion should always be sent. Otherwise, indexer can get stuck.
