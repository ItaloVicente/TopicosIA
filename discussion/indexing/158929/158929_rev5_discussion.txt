DESCRIPTION:

MB-46883: Rebalance failed with error index already exists

When node is failedover another index with same name as that of index on the failed node can be created, when the failed over node is added back to cluster, cluster now has duplicate index, these may or may not be equivalent indexes but they have same name. This sometimes causes rebalance to fail with error index already exists. The fix addresses the issue by detecting the duplicate indexes and deleting the duplicate index if they are equivalant. In case of duplicate indexes being non-equivalant system behaves as it used to behave earlier which means there is a chance of rebalance failure with index already exists.

Line:226, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> It is better to first post the token and then issue drop index request. E.g. the drop index can return timeout or give a transient error, in which case it is not clear if the command succeeded or not. Index cleanup may still happen based on the metadata update.

I am yet to look at entire code.
Line:228, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> As of today, the command tokens are posted only on user commands. Do you want to add "internal=true" flag in the token so that these can be identified later ?

Please check if adding new variables to the tokens does not fail in the mixed version cluster.

Line:226, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> Ack

Line:228, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> Do we really need that as this is going to be a rare case anyway? also in the case that we want to add it, can we take it as a separate patch? Since this will definitely add to the required testing especially for 7.0.1.

Line:226, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> I will move it before the dropindex as suggested, but I realized more than before or after, what i need to do is irrespective of the status of dropIndex request, post tokens for every identified index and have retry (at least once) if drop token call fails, since we have already removed these indexes from planner consideration so now we do want them be removed for sure.
