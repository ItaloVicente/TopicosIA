DESCRIPTION:

MB-46883: Rebalance failed with error index already exists

When node is failedover another index with same name as that of index on the failed node can be created, when the failed over node is added back to cluster, cluster now has duplicate index, these may or may not be equivalent indexes but they have same name. This sometimes causes rebalance to fail with error index already exists. The fix addresses the issue by detecting the duplicate indexes and deleting the duplicate index if they are equivalant. In case of duplicate indexes being non-equivalant system behaves as it used to behave earlier which means there is a chance of rebalance failure with index already exists.

Line:200, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> I have standardized on "method" as the name of this constant in other routines in rebalancer.go (and actually everywhere I have done this) so would be better to use the same name in this one.

Thanks for using const -- I'd forgotten to do that on most of mine due to Go's := operator encouraging laziness! const is created at compile time and so is better than := which creates a variable at runtime. I am going to update ones in my own code to use const as well.

Line:210, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> For a partitioned index, if some of the rest calls fail for an index, the cluster can end up with an index with missing partitions. The drop can follow the same approach used by the gsiclient, where a metakv token is posted, so that the cleanup will eventually happen.

Line:320, secondary/indexer/rebalancer.go -> If the rebalance was cancelled while the planner was running, RemoveDuplicateIndexes shouldn't proceed to drop indexes. Arbitrary amount of time can pass between the planner finishing and the next set of cluster operations after cancel.
