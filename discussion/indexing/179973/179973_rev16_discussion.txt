DESCRIPTION:

MB-52930 Recover index into slice and build recovered index

a. Once the transfer of a shard is complete, destination node will
   change the state of transfer token to ShardTokenRecoverShard
b. In this state, destination node will post REST requests to indexer
   to create and recover index instances
c. First, all deferred indexes in a shard are created using
   "/createIndexRebalance" endpoint. Once they are successfully created,
   the RState of the index instances is changed to REBAL_ACTIVE
d. For all non-deferred indexes, they are grouped based on collections
   and all index instances in a collection are recovered one after
   another sequentially
e. After all non-deferred instances in a collection are recovered,
   destination node will issue a"/buildRecoveredIndexesRebalance"
   request
f. Indexer will compute the minimum snapshot timestamp of all index
   instances and starts streams with the computed timestamps
