Line:249, secondary/dcp/upr.go -> nodeFeeds can be modified concurrently.

Line:56, secondary/projector/projector.go -> Isn't it better to have channel size of at least 1 so projector won't block even if stats mgr is busy?  Is there any reason to make it a blocking channel?

Line:274, secondary/projector/projector.go -> Please double check that these maps will not get modified concurrently by other goroutines even if feed is locked in projector.
- feed.kvdata
- feed.endpoints
- feed.feeders

For example, feed.cleanupBucket() may be called in feed.go without acquiring feed lock.

When we are going to have this in production, we should also have mortimer integration for plotting these stats. Else, debugging ends up as challenging task.

Line:249, secondary/dcp/upr.go -> Thanks for the review John.

I have updated the patch to read the nodeFeed object from the genServer() to make sure that there won't be any concurrent access.

Line:274, secondary/projector/projector.go -> Thanks for the review John. 

I missed the feed.cleanupBucket() call that triggers when runScatter crashes. 

I have updated the patch to read the stats objects from feed's genServer() loop. This ensures that the feed.kvdata, feed.endpoints and feed.feeders maps will not be accessed concurrently.
