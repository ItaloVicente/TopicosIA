DESCRIPTION:

MB-31955 Add support for DCP system events at projector

The DCP_SYSTEMS_EVENTS pertaining to CollectionCreate,
CollectionDrop, CollectionFlush, ScopeCreate, ScopeDrop,
CollectionChanged are propagated to down-stream with this patch

Five new fields are introduced in DcpEvent structure. These are:
(a) ManifestUID (b) ScopeID (c) CollectionID (d) EventType (e) MaxTTL.

ManifestUID and ScopeID are stored as slice of bytes.

CollectionID is stored as Uint32 to avoid multiple conversions (It is
easy to decode collectionID as Uint32 from mutation key. Also, filtering
at KVData is relatively simple with Uint32 values when compared to slice of
bytes).

EventType represents one of the 6 system events. MaxTTL is the maximum ttl
value of the collection

The key, oldKey, partnKey in KeyVersions are mis-interpreted to represent
manifestUID, scopeID and collectionID while sending data to indexer.

Change-Id: I023d03b36c081611d1006790c1e756c3e3ebab3a

Line:430, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Is this event per stream?
Should we set sendAct to true ?

Line:443, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Do we need to maintain stats for system event ?

Line:99, secondary/dcp/transport/mc_constants.go -> Just a suggestion, would it be a better idea to start from non-zero ?

Line:430, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Yes. This event is per stream. And, it is a good idea to set sencAck to true. Thanks for pointing this. Updated this code in patch set-2

Line:443, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Yes. I plan to do it in separate patch. With collections, I still have to think about what stats should be per collection and what can be kept at bucket level. So, I decided to do it later

Line:99, secondary/dcp/transport/mc_constants.go -> KV is using 0x00 for COLLECTION_CREATE. I am adhering to the same semantics
