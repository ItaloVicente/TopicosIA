DESCRIPTION:

MB-49356 Part 6 = the real fix (7.1.0 2103) Use correct dest in TT keys

The post-planning executor.go filterSolution() feature added the
explicit field IndexUsage.destNode *IndexerNode, and filterSolution()
sets that field to the destination *IndexerNode pointer. When
filterSolution() changes a destination, it updates only the destNode
field – it does not actually move the IndexUsage to the new destination
node's Solution.Placement.Indexes[] slice.

genTransferToken() before the filtering feature thus used
IndexerNode.NodeUUID (indexer.NodeUUID variable.field) as the
destination.

After filtering it should instead use IndexUsage.destNode.NodeUUID
(index.destNode.NodeUUID variable.field.field) everywhere, but it was
not doing so in all cases.

MB-42220 (original feature) changed several of the old destination node
references but missed three.

MB-44311 fixed one that was missed in the original feature but not the
other two.

MB-49356 (current bug) fixes the last two that were still missed by the
prior MBs, namely the creation of the tokenKeys into the tokens[] map.
The last field in this key was using the implicit destination instead of
the explicit one, causing key aliasing when filterSolution() had changed
some partition destinations of a partitioned index.
