DESCRIPTION:

MB-34193 Set ReadDeadline in projector doReceive()

In cases where projector misses TCP notificatons like connection closure,
the dcp_feed would continuously wait for data on the connection resulting
in index build getting stuck.

In such scenarios, the read deadline would terminate the blocking read
calls thereby unblocking the dcp_feed. This is only a safe-guard measure
to handle highly unlikely scenarios like missing TCP notifications. In
those cases, an "i/o timeout" error will be returned to the reader.

The read deadline is enabled only after the initialization routines
like doDcpOpen() finish execution

Line:60, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Minor comments:

(1) name can be enableReadDeadline for readability.
(2) can be uint32.

Line:752, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Do you want to convert this to "Write Only" deadline. Because we are setting read deadline in doReceive(), doDcpRequestStream can overwrite the read deadline set by doReceive() and doReceive can timeout in 120 seconds.

Is it possible?

Is it possible?
