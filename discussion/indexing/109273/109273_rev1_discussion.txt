DESCRIPTION:

MB-34193 Set ReadDeadline in projector doReceive()

In cases where projector misses TCP notificatons like connection closure,
the dcp_feed would continuously wait for data on the connection resulting
in index build getting stuck.

In such scenarios, the read deadline would terminate the blocking read
calls thereby unblocking the dcp_feed. This is only a safe-guard measure
to handle highly unlikely scenarios like missing TCP notifications. In
those cases, an "i/o timeout" error will be returned to the reader.

Line:1231, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Can this reset the deadline set in doDcpOpen ? I think we need a better way to Handle timeout in different code paths. The fix may not be trivial. 

For example, we may need to set a flag in doDcpOpen and don't set the deadline here if the flag is set.

Line:36, secondary/dcp/transport/client/mc.go -> Minor comment: we can name this "DcpMutationReadTimeout" / "DcpStreamReadTimeout"  or some other specific name as this timeout has very specific purpose (unlike other timeouts at various different places).

Line:1231, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> Hi Amit, Yes. This can reset the deadline in doDcpOpen. Thanks for pointing this out.

I have updated a new patch where the read-deadline is set only after initialization routines like doDcpOpen(), doGetFailoverLog() or doGetDcpSeqnos() finish execution. In other places where McdDeadline is set (i.e. sendBufferAck, Noop transmit etc), read-deadline does not impact the behaviour as these methods does only connection write operations and reset the dead lines after the connection write is successful. If not, they will timeout on write

Line:36, secondary/dcp/transport/client/mc.go -> Done
