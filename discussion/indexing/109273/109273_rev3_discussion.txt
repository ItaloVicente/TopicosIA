DESCRIPTION:

MB-34193 Set ReadDeadline in projector doReceive()

In cases where projector misses TCP notificatons like connection closure,
the dcp_feed would continuously wait for data on the connection resulting
in index build getting stuck.

In such scenarios, the read deadline would terminate the blocking read
calls thereby unblocking the dcp_feed. This is only a safe-guard measure
to handle highly unlikely scenarios like missing TCP notifications. In
those cases, an "i/o timeout" error will be returned to the reader.

The read deadline is enabled only after the initialization routines
like doDcpOpen() finish execution

Line:577, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> I think if you don't use the enableReadDeadline, it should be fine as well. Just setting the ReadDeadline in defer should be enough. doReceive is not actively receiving as no vbstreams have been added yet. Changing the deadline applies to any pending operation.

Line:577, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> I used enableReadDeadline to selectively enable read-deadline only after all the initialisation routines (E.g. doDcpOpen) have finished execution. 

If readDeadline is enabled by default in doReceive(), then it can happen that we overwrite the 120 sec read dead-line set by doDcpOpen and wait for 1800 sec incase memcached does not respond (i.e. doDcpOpen sets 120 sec read and write deadline, doReceive overwrites the 120 sec read deadline to 1800 sec). 

Since we do not want to wait for 1800 sec in doDcpOpen if memcached does not send response, I have used enableReadDeadline as a way to notify doReceive() to set the read-deadline

Line:577, secondary/dcp/transport/client/dcp_feed.go -> sounds good.

Line:106, secondary/dcp/transport/client/mc.go -> Do you want the write deadline to be 30mins as well? I see this function now replaces the SetMcdConnectionDeadline which is 120sec.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:106, secondary/dcp/transport/client/mc.go -> Yes. I intend the write deadline to be 120 sec. It's a stupid mistake from my side. Sorry for the confusion
