DESCRIPTION:

MB-43221 Fix TCP conn leaks in set04_restful_test.go, comment out restful.go

set04_restful_test.go was leaking every TCP connection it used. Fixed now.

restful.go was as well but since this code is not used Deep agreed I can
comment it out so we don't have to keep researching and maintaining it.

Varun told me in Slack he forgot to give +2 this time as we just changed over to +2s from approvers, but this is good to go.
