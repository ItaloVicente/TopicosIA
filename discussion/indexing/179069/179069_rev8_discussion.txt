DESCRIPTION:

MB-52930 Initiate shard transfer from rebalance master

Current logic picks first "rebalance.transferBatchSize" tokens
from r.transferTokens map and initiates transfer for those
tokens. One this batch finishes next batch is picked up similarly.

A more intelligent algorithm is required to stream transfer tokens
so that the cluster resources are efficiently utilised.
E.g., rebalancer can prevent transfer of different shards from same
source node in a single batch as it can lead network saturation.
