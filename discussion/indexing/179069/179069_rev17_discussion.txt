DESCRIPTION:

MB-52930 Initiate shard transfer from rebalance master

Current logic picks first "rebalance.transferBatchSize" tokens
from r.transferTokens map and initiates transfer for those
tokens. One this batch finishes next batch is picked up similarly.

A more intelligent algorithm is required to stream transfer tokens
so that the cluster resources are efficiently utilised.
E.g., rebalancer can prevent transfer of different shards from same
source node in a single batch as it can lead network saturation.

Line:632, secondary/indexer/shard_rebalancer.go -> We'll need to pair up the tokens moving from 2 nodes of a subcluster. So, either both the movements will be successful or rebalancer will do the cleanup on failure.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:632, secondary/indexer/shard_rebalancer.go -> The logic of batching needs some more thought from my side. Currently, it is picking random batches based on transfer token size. I have added a separate TODO to address this. Will handle batching in a separate patch.
