DESCRIPTION:

MB-30788: Introduce recovery in CollectSeqnos

The observed panic is seen only if kvfeeds passed to CollectSeqnos
is an empty map. We don't expect this to happen as this possibility
is safeguarded by numVbs check in addDBSbucket. Once the object of
vbSeqnosReader is created, there is no code that changes the value of
vbSeqnosReader.kvfeeds.

This code change avoids panic in CollecSeqnos. This is just a safeguard
which ensures progress as the retry happens with updated clusterinfo.

I guess the problem here is that CollectSeqnos is working with kvfeeds without any lock on dcp_buckets_seqnos, which could be changed by some other goroutine.

CollectSeqnos works with kvfeeds stored in vbSeqnoReader object. vbSeqnoReader object is created in addDBSbucket which is protected by lock. Same is true with delDBSbucket. "kvfeeds" itself doesn't change in its lifecycle. In case, there are no kv nodes for a bucket, there is check in addDBSbucket for numVb, it will get invoked and the error will be returned. 

I did not find any possible race. Am I missing any particular race condition ?

Just a thought. What if something panics inside addDBSbucket() while err is still nil? defer is executed and since is err is nil, it goes ahead and calls newVbSeqnosReader. kvfeeds is empty which could be leading to the panic seen
