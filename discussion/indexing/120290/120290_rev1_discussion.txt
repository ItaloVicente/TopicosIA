DESCRIPTION:

MB-31959 Update openFeeder() method to become keyspace aware

The openFeeder() method opens an upstream feed with the bucket name.
With collections, the projector book-keeping is made at keyspace level
and not at bucket level. The Keyspace name is chosen by indexer. This
patch updates the openFeeder() method to open the upstream feed with
keyspace name. It also assumes that the keyspace name is same as bucket
name (until the request from indexer is updated to contain keyspace name)
