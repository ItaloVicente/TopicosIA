Line:383, secondary/planner/executor.go -> If a rebalance is in progress and an index is moving, will this function return both the indexes or just one index?

Line:383, secondary/planner/executor.go -> In case of "add-remove node rebalance", rebalance and DDL are mutually exclusive. So until rebalance completes i.e. on destination side, until index gets created, and on source side, until index gets dropped, the DDL is not allowed. This protects us from the scenario you mentioned.

When failover is happening, the indexes are not moved.

Am I missing any corner case/ race condition?

I tested the behaviour by adding sleep in /dropIndex code path (and some other places), rebalance doesn't get finished until /dropIndex and other index cleanup operations are finished.

Line:383, secondary/planner/executor.go -> The check to prevent a DDL during rebalance is done at the server(indexer). This function will be invoked by the metadata provider independently. At this point, there is nothing to stop this from executing if a rebalance is in progress.

Can RetrievePlanFromCluster return 2 copies for the index which is moving as part of rebalance?
