DESCRIPTION:

MB-29317: plasma - serialize persistence by instance

When a large number of indexes start writing to disk simultaneously,
it causes disk to be 100% utilized which impacts query latency when
node is in DGM.
Since persistence is already parallelized, only allow 1 index to
perform full persistence at a given time.

Hi Deep, inspired by your question, I upload this patchset which simply serializes the persistence to 1 index at a time. Unlike MOI where it is ok for persistence to use up 100% disk bandwidth, in plasma, we want to make sure that the disk isn't overwhelmed.
