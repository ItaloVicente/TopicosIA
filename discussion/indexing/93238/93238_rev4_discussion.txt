DESCRIPTION:

MB-29317: plasma - serialize persistence by instance

When a large number of indexes start writing to disk simultaneously,
it causes disk to be 100% utilized which impacts query latency when
node is in DGM.
First control concurrency of persistence by amount of data.
Now, since persistence is already parallelized,
only allow 1 index to perform full persistence at a given time.

Thanks Sundar. The new approach looks fine to me. Sarath would have a better idea if this can have any downside from plasma perspective. 

Also please see my earlier comment on updateMOIWriters. I think that method needs to be fixed:

"Another thing I noticed is that moiWritersAllowed doesn't get updated when updateMOIWriters gets called. So the setting change may not work the second time."
Line:1005, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Is it better to limit the concurr to a fraction of NumCPU? I am not very sure how CPU intensive the recovery point creation is.

Line:1010, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> As ItemsCount and GetCommittedCount are going to be same for a persisted snapshot, is this calculation required or we can set concurr to some pre-determined value?

Thanks for the catch, Deep. I addressed the updateMOIWriter bug in the latest patchset. Could you please take a look at it?
Line:1005, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Good point Deep. Maybe it's best to reuse an existing parameter persistenceCPUPercent that appears to be for this exact purpose and not add more colorful logic.

Line:1010, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> Thanks for spotting this. I just fixed it to reuse an existing param instead of adding more computations.
