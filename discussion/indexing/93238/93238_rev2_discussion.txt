DESCRIPTION:

MB-29317: plasma - throttle persistence based on numCPU

When a large number of indexes start writing to disk simultaneously,
it causes disk to be 100% utilized which impacts query latency when
node is in DGM. So use buffered channel = number of CPU cores
So the max number of go routines spawned = numCPU * concurrency.

Line:1003, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> for MOI, the total is maintained globally for all indexes. It looks like here this number is local to the plasma instance?

Line:1003, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> So in plasma, the persistence will only write incremental pages that aren't already persisted already by eviction etc, so I thought it is ok to leave it as a per instance value? Also the concurrency is already capped at NumCPU(), unlike in MOI where it is 2 x NumCPU().
I was thinking if the disk utilization problem shows up again, then we can be more aggressive on this throttling?

Another thing I noticed is that moiWritersAllowed doesn't get updated when updateMOIWriters gets called. So the setting change may not work the second time.
Line:1003, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> ok. so the moiWritersAllowed is 2 x NumCPU() for plasma. And as itemscount is going to be roughly equal to committed count, concurr will be NumCPU(). Does that mean effectively on a 40 core box, a total of NumCPU() x NumCPU() = 1600 parallel threads can do persistence(assuming 40 indexes on the box)?

Line:1003, secondary/indexer/plasma_slice.go -> That's correct but also doesn't sound good esp the way you put it.
I'll discuss this with Sarath and update.
Do you think limiting number of parallel persistence operations to 2 would be acceptable?
