DESCRIPTION:

MB-35199 Fix concurrent map iteration and map write for fCmdGetStats message

In feed.go, when a request is made to get the feed level stats, the
feed.stats object is being updated and returned. This can cause
a concurrent map iteration and map write panic as it can happen
that one go-routine is clonning the feed.stats object while another
go-routine is updating the feed.stats object

This patch aims to fix the concurrent map access problem by initializing
a new FeedStats object whenever stats are to be retrieved from feed.go.

Line:321, secondary/projector/projector.go -> It is necessary to serialise the retrieval of feedStats and its updation of stats manager. Otherwise, it can lead to inconsistent map. E.g., for a stream if an MTR for one bucket is followed by deleteBuckets for another bucket, consider the sequence: 
(a) Computation of feedStats for MTR 
(b) Computation of feedStats by delBuckets 
(c) Updation of stats map to stats_manger by delBuckets call 
(d) updation of stats map to stats_manager by MTR. 

When the MTR updates the stats map, it can contain the stats object referring to the bucket that got deleted leading to inconsistent map
