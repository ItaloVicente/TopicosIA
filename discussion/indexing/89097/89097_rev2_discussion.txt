Unfortunately, Perry hasn't attached logs. The challenge is how do we differentiate unable-to-connect-with-projector from legit-error-from-projector. Same is the case when net.Listen() fails. The error we get from golang seems to be a bit confusing. It should ideally say "bind: Address already in use". But instead we get "bind: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted.". It seems the error message can be different based on OS.
