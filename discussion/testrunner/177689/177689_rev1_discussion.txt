Line:1757, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> What happens if it doesn't exist? Maybe it's worth adding a check and a clear error, so it'll be easy to understand in the Jenkins logs?

Line:1762, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> what happens if no_of_backups is 1? Should we have a special case/error for this, in case it happens and we need to look at the logs?

Line:3685, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_test.py -> Could this result in a hang, if the condition is never met?

Line:1757, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> Not sure I understand what you mean, this line just exists to pad a list to the correct length, so we can write the correct amount while looping. What might not exist here?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1757, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> Oh, I was referring to the comment that expects a list of tasks. What happens if there are no tasks, for some weird reason? What would the error look like? Will it be obvious that there were no tasks? 

I'm only asking because it might be easier to understand the logs. 
If you think the logs will be readable, that's the most important thing.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1757, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> The tasks would be generated by running backups, if these were to fail for whatever reason, the test would stop there and show that a backup had failed.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1762, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> if no_of_backups is one, it will work as normal, just performing this action only once.
