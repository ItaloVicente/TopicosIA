Awesome work Jake, I think I'm happy with this.

I would also double check that things work mostly as before with the parameter missing (or set to false).

Perhaps a doc string to explain what each function does and each of the arguments mean to round things off.

I think it's best @Pavithra has the final say as this patch speeds up to her work.
