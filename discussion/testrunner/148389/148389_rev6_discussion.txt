> What should be done about memory quotas. Currently the cluster quotas are set based on the first node in the cluster. E.g. if node1 has kv,fts and node2 has kv then the quota for kv will subtract 256mb for fts. If node1 and node2 are switched the fts quota is not subtracted and each node in the cluster will potentially be oversized. Is this a problem that needs to be addresed? I don't know what test owners currently do

Aren't we already picking node with least mem as first node already in populate.py?
