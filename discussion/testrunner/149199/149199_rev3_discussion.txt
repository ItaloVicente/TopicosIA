Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> unmarshal

Line:206, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_examine_test.py -> Worth noting that this is an "internal value" which is only exposed for the sake of the backup service, it should have no meaning to the end user since it's literally just an enumeration.

It would be nice if we're not too strict with this because I'm sure it will change in the future.
