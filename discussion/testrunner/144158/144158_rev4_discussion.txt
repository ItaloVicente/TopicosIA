Patch Set 4:

There is duplication of the get_cbcollect_info function in various places. For now I've made the necessary changes to all of those areas. Should I refactor the duplicate code?

Looks okay to me. Couple of suggestions:
1) Could we please capture the time saved? Force cbcollect (by setting test_failed=False and get-cbcollect-info=True) for 1 test and measure difference in run time with and without this gerrit.
2) Could you point out where the duplicate code is please?

Based on the testing I did, for a 4 node cluster the time taken was 1/4 with this change. I will also run a sanity job to double check

Line:3771, pytests/fts/fts_base.py -> You can remove def collect_logs(servers) and directly call get_cbcollect_info(servers)

Line:135, scripts/collect_server_info.py -> Should we set some timeout for join() call? we have seen cases where cb collect hangs when cluster goes bad shape while collecting or someother issues. In those cases, this will lead to a hanging jobs.

Line:135, scripts/collect_server_info.py -> For now I have added a 1 hour total timeout. Is that value ok?
