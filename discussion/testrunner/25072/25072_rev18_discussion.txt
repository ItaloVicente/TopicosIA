Nice work Iyrna,

There seems to be lots of new features involved in this refactor.  Ideally I'd like to separate new things from refactors, but I can see how refactoring involves additions so in the change description you also list all new features so that we can know what's gone into the code.  For instance I saw:
* support for multiple doc-generators during load
* allow specifying which server to query
* new monitorResultsTask
* ability to pass pre-generated results to viewQueryVerificationTask
Line:15, conf/dev-py-viewquery.conf -> can this test be run? issue resolved

Line:320, lib/couchbase/cluster.py -> ddoc_options and check_replication need documenting

Line:484, lib/couchbase/cluster.py -> add info about type_query param

Line:512, lib/couchbase/cluster.py -> should something be here in the comment section?

Line:531, lib/couchbase/cluster.py -> add info about results param

Line:541, lib/couchbase/cluster.py -> this is indeed a very long line, why not do the '\n' in the middle of the arglist?  say at num_verified_docs

Line:553, lib/couchbase/cluster.py -> add info about results param

Line:137, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> or you can pass in timeout here and then calculate end_time within method.  this way anyone using this method will not also have to calculate end_time before calling

Line:146, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> this is also this same method in viewtests.py…consider _wait_for_indexer_ddoc_pid (?)

Line:165, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> end_time may have expired here.  Maybe that's indented. The other alternative is to  pass a timeout to this wait_for_task_pid and do a retry count here.

Line:545, lib/tasks/task.py -> I don't agree with this inheritance as it's not needed.

The run function should instead make a LoadDocumentTask for each generator, run it and wait for results.

Line:1425, lib/tasks/task.py -> can be defined in __init__

Line:1445, lib/tasks/task.py -> this should be refactored.

Check only conditions that lead to state = FINISHED.  for any other error, it's not important to do matching as new errors may pop up, so just log it and just schedule with 10s delay.

Line:115, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> I believe this change allows multi-loadgens .  can you do
self.load(data_set, [geneartor_load, generator_delete])

Line:545, lib/tasks/task.py -> it takes a very long time, as each generator then creates its own vbucketaware connection.

Line:137, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> it is a private method, and if i will pass timeout instead it will wait this timeout for each node, and i need to wait till end_time for all the servers

Line:146, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> viewtests.py will be deleted, as we don't use it anymore

Line:165, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> it works as I expected, index can run very quick and disappear earlier than we check it after block

Line:1445, lib/tasks/task.py -> I know specific list of errors i can skip but i don't know all errors that can be raised. Should I change the code just to raise exception instead of scheduling?

Line:115, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> both generator are lists, so i should create one more list containing both generators. I decided that loading one by one will be more understandable

Line:545, lib/tasks/task.py -> ok but problem is 
1) self.op_type is same for all generators.  I'm not sure how this will work for say a create+delete generator. 
2) how will this work on using generators against different bucket.  when init sets load against 1 bucket?

Line:1445, lib/tasks/task.py -> I see. this is fine, although same problem exists where if there is a new error then it may not get raised.  I suggest just raising exception for anything that doesn't put you into FINISHED state.  so it's positive checking.  and not being specific about the negatives

Line:1445, lib/tasks/task.py -> if there is a new error, block else in 1474 row will care about it, and will put it into results, task will be finished.
