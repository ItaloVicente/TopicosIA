DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-5729 : Seeing 'KeyError' during rerun_job task
 execution

While merging of test cases, on some of the test cases, the
merge failed since the test case were almost identical except
for some of the parameters being in different order. Fixed
the issue by sorting the parameters while comparing the
test cases already processed to solve the problem.
