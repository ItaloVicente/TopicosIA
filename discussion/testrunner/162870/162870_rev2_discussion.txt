DESCRIPTION:

Update Readme.md and update setup.sh for better setup

Updated Readme.md to better reflect the current state
of testrunner. Added text to help setup a machine to run
tests and also provided few examples on running sanity
tests before checkins. Removed redundant and old text that
didn't make sense in current state.
Updated setup.sh to install python and the requirements
based on the operating system and need.

Line:94, setup.sh -> Where is this method being used?

Line:98, setup.sh -> We refer python 2.7 as python and python 3.7 as python3 in all our slaves and setups. I think its better to follow the same conventions and create right alternatives.

Line:130, setup.sh -> From this wiki we see other system lib installs as well : https://hub.internal.couchbase.com/confluence/display/QA/Python+3.7.6+installation+for+testrunner
its better to stick to this, so it avoids any issues further.

Line:202, setup.sh -> Just verify requirements.txt has all the python modules and same versions as mentioned in this wiki.
