DESCRIPTION:

Update Readme.md and update setup.sh for better setup

Updated Readme.md to better reflect the current state
of testrunner. Added text to help setup a machine to run
tests and also provided few examples on running sanity
tests before checkins. Removed redundant and old text that
didn't make sense in current state.
Updated setup.sh to install python and the requirements
based on the operating system and need.
