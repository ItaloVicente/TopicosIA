DESCRIPTION:

Update Readme.md and update setup.sh for better setup

Updated Readme.md to better reflect the current state
of testrunner. Added text to help setup a machine to run
tests and also provided few examples on running sanity
tests before checkins. Removed redundant and old text that
didn't make sense in current state.
Updated setup.sh to install python and the requirements
based on the operating system and need.

Line:21, README.md -> I think we said we were going to recommend exactly 3.7.6 until the issues with later versions are fixed.

Line:25, README.md -> I think the recommendation now is to use python3 -m venv when creating virtual environments so you don't have to install a separate package

Line:182, setup.sh -> Python SDK 2.5.12 should just work with python3.

Is it worth adding something about java_sdk_client?
Line:182, setup.sh -> Also, SDK 2.5.12 does not come packaged with libcouchbase so you have to install it separately. Maybe add links to the install readme for the python sdk

Line:21, README.md -> Ahh I see. I wasn't aware there were issues with 3.8. I will update the readme and the setup to install 3.7.6 version specifically.

Line:25, README.md -> Will fix this.

Line:182, setup.sh -> Ahh yes. I forgot to add the libcouchbase setup. I had tested out the script that installed the required version, but had to take it out for debugging. Will add it back and send for review.
