DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6037: Improved setup for dealing with cluster islands

Suppose you have the initial cluster containing node1, node2 and node3.

During a failover, if node 1 is ejected you end up with a cluster island
where node2 and node3 are in their own cluster. This commit helps to
deal with this situation by ejecting node3 from node2.

Line:357, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Clusters should be defined in ini files..I would not recommend doing this.

Line:357, pytests/basetestcase.py -> While that's True, the ini file does not actually form the cluster for you. 

Suppose you have an ini file like so:

server:
server1
server2
server3
server4

cluster1:
server1
server2
server3

cluster2
server4

Cluster 1 is not formed into a cluster by testrunner which is why this section of the code is required. All it does it is turn the servers specified in Cluster1 in the ini file into a cluster.

So all of this code is hidden behind a 'backup_service_test' input param (although it's test agonistic). As a side note, if a test wants to automatically form a cluster before it runs the user can set the 'backup_service_test' flag (by default set for every backup service test).

So this logic is part of a bigger picture where you don't need to tearDown between individual test runs. Because doing that involves rebalancing into a single node cluster at the end of a test and reforming into a 3 node cluster at the start of every test. Also you don't want to perform the rebalance after the data has been loaded into buckets as you have move a lot of vbuckets between odes which takes a really long time.

So where does this patch fit in?

Lets suppose you have this picture initially:

Cluster_a: [server1, server2, server3]

Well suppose you failover node1 and you end up with a situation in which you have two clusters:

Cluster_a: [server1] and Cluster_b: [server2, server3]

This patch simply breaks Cluster_b apart so it can be rebalanced back into Cluster_a.

Line:357, pytests/basetestcase.py -> I may be wrong about the automatic provisioning of clusters, I think testrunner may form the clusters but it doesn't respect the services.

It gives server1 the correct services, but doesn't give server2 and server3 the correct services. It just gives them the data service if I remember correctly.

I have double checked.

So when I use testrunner's default setUp, you end up 4 single node clusters. In other words, the cluster in the ini file gets ignored and each node is only provisioned with the data service.
