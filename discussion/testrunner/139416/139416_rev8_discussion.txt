DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6037: Improved setup for dealing with cluster islands

Suppose you have the initial cluster containing node1, node2 and node3.

During a failover, if node 1 is ejected you end up with a cluster island
where node2 and node3 are in their own cluster. This commit helps to
deal with this situation by ejecting node3 from node2.
