Is the intent here to check the "expiration" is getting correctly retrieved by view queries or to verify that view queries do not return expired items?

test case is written by Peter requirement:
 we create an item with expiration, like for instance in an hour and then we wait for it to show up in the view and we emit the meta.expiration and it matches

Line:2382, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> Its not clear what's being checked here. row['value'] is meta.expiration or self.expire..why are we using -100/+100 in the comparison..

Line:2382, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> row['value'] is value of emited results['rows']. And it should be the same as user set it, +-100 is because i am not able to put an exact time in millis from start of epoc. The expiration is set is milliseconds and i don't know exact millisecond of setting item request.

Line:2382, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> The documentation says "Expiration times are expressed in seconds" and here also you are setting it to self.expire which is 60 seconds by default..Sorry not clear on the milliseconds part..

Line:2382, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> expiration times is expressed in seconds when you set it in request, but in the document itself it is set as milliseconds since epoch start(1/1/1970 GMT)
An example: 
1. In the test you get current time(supposed this time + seconds of expiration is document ttl limit)
2. You send a request to create the document with expiration in seconds (note that some milliseconds is already passed since you run point 1, so the time is incorrect already)
3. Request is receives by server and since this moment expiration is calculated in the server(some more millis are passed)

As result you cannot calculate exactly the time which will be set into the document, you can calculate it only with delta
