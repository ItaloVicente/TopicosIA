DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6533: Change send to sendall

What's the problem?

The Socket.send() may not send all of the in buffer. Our implementation
of the mc_bin_client does not handle the case when this happens
potentially resulting in malformed packets being sent.

What's the fix?

Use Socket.sendall() instead of Socket.send().

CBQE-6540: Fix timeout issues in upgrade tests

Remove the clause which prevents the batched document verifier from
being used if there is more than 1 bucket.

Increase the timeout in verify_all_buckets in upgrade testing.
