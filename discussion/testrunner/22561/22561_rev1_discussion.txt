Line:19, pytests/observe/observetest.py -> the same param exists in basetestcase

Line:30, pytests/observe/observetest.py -> I didn't catch this loop. we rebalance in all nodes except self.servers[1]?

Line:41, pytests/observe/observetest.py -> gen_load can be set with self in setup

Line:53, pytests/observe/observetest.py -> this func is used only one time, it can removed and we can use _async_load_all_buckets from basetestcase. and
gen_load can be set with self in setup

Line:148, pytests/observe/observetest.py -> better use the same params as in basetestcase, as self.master

Line:149, pytests/observe/observetest.py -> you override self.servers from basetestace with kist of Node object. it's a bad practice

Line:165, pytests/observe/observetest.py -> does it print logs for all keys?

Line:195, pytests/observe/observetest.py -> does it print logs for all keys?

Line:215, pytests/observe/observetest.py -> it's better to use log here and more info( what is this ip)

Line:217, pytests/observe/observetest.py -> it's better to use log here and more info( what is this ip)
