Best to add new patch to original review.
Line:62, testrunner.py -> Can the options be simplified further ?

Line:124, testrunner.py -> https will need a certificate for identity. what about credentials ? With simplification of options this will be more better.

Line:346, testrunner.py -> Code needs to be out of parsing logic, can be improved further with reuse of file path variable for file. Entire os needs to in try catch. All hardcoded file path need to move to constant.

Line:356, testrunner.py -> can there be an xpath here, since an xml.

Line:358, testrunner.py -> not sure why this is needed.

Thanks for the feedback. I need to how to add a 2nd patch set in gerrit. May be we talk during our meeting.

In general, I would request to focus more on must fixes (fail-fast mode) for the checkin so that we can get some maturity and fix issues if any quickly -- so functionality/use case. So I think let us do 1) must have changes 2) nice to have that can go next based on time. It all depends on how much time to spend and cost associated with these changes.
Based on the above, please give the score so that we can move on.
Line:62, testrunner.py -> In fact, I have tried to simplify and optimize and contained all include part in -d and exclude part in -e options. If you separate, it would add more complexity to handle the dependencies (option1 -- option2 -- option3) among multiple options. Just give what is to be included, then it should work. About some if conditions, I don't think many. Even if you add more options, then also you can't eliminate if conditions.
In the current case, all you need do is have a jenkins job with one include_tests and user can update with any of these supported values instead of dynamically adding new options or too many options.
If any few cases need to be separated, we can think about real value and change it. It is simple to play with these options. 

Let us discuss more.

Line:124, testrunner.py -> Good point. But I was using the same python urllib so I thought it will take care. In fact, I think it was future if we have any with https. I had tried with our Jenkins with http. I will also double check later.

Line:346, testrunner.py -> First part is not clear. Let us discuss more.
About constants, I can add those to the constants.py

Line:356, testrunner.py -> Not required. It will get the right nodes or node value for the elements.

Line:358, testrunner.py -> In fact, not required as it was with different logic first and later I had changed;) I can remove in the next iteration.
