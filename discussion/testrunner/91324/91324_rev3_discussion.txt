DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-4589: Add compression support using SDK on serverside functional tests

Added compression support for server side tests while using SDK in the tests.
1. Set environment variable for using the SDK in the tests instead of the default memcached client
2. Use sdk_compression=True or False in the tests when using the SDK for loadgen. The default is set to True since by default the compression in SDK is on by default

These changes should work for most features that use basetestcase and standard library functions. Changes have been made to xdcr and fts bases too to reflect the changes.
