DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6037: (1/2) Infrastructure changes for schedule testing

A Repository can now determine which task is scheduled next and what
time it is scheduled.

Given a time, a Plan can determine the next task is scheduled. This is
coupled with logic to only to update specific tasks. This allows us to
build a schedule tester which follows similar logic to the backup
service.

Line:59, lib/backup_service_client/models/task_template.py -> Not sure if you meant to assign self._merge_options = merge_options and self._full_backup = full_backup, cos they were just declared.

Line:59, lib/backup_service_client/models/task_template.py -> So this section of the code is mostly auto-generated.

So what's happening here is due to the setters and getters in Python. 

There's a function below called merge_options (decorated with @merge_options.setter) and full_backup (decorated with @full_backup.setter) and you have the equivalent getters (decorated with @property). So when you assign to self.merge_options or self.full_backup, you are actually assigning to self._merge_options and self._full_backup.
