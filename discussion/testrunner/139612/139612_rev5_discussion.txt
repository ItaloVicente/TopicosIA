DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6037: (1/2) Infrastructure changes for schedule testing

A Repository can now determine which task is scheduled next and what
time it is scheduled.

Given a time, a Plan can determine the next task is scheduled. This is
coupled with logic to only to update specific tasks. This allows us to
build a schedule tester which follows similar logic to the backup
service.
