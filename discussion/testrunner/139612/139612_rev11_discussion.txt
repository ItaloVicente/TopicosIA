DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6037: (1/2) Infrastructure changes for schedule testing

A Repository can now determine which task is scheduled next and what
time it is scheduled.

Given a time, a Plan can determine the next task is scheduled. This is
coupled with logic to only to update specific tasks. This allows us to
build a schedule tester which follows similar logic to the backup
service.

Line:83, lib/backup_service_client/models/plan.py -> is this min based on string comparison? if so this could be an issue as the go time marshalling is not stable.

Line:83, lib/backup_service_client/models/plan.py -> This is should be a comparison of a datetime object produced from a calculation where I try to predict when that task is scheduled.

I use datetime objects for all comparisons.
