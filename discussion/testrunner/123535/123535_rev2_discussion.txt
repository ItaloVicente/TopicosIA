Line:55, scripts/install_constants.py -> Better to not suppress the wget output, in case we need to debug.

Line:598, scripts/install_utils.py -> Would be good to check if file exists after command and retry if needed, similar to check_and_retry_download_binary()

Line:55, scripts/install_constants.py -> I think it is not that useful usually. I have added log.info while downloading message (at least that will show in the log that download with wget is happening and location given). See how much wget log with incremental progress log taken at http://qa.sc.couchbase.com/job/test_suite_executor_cbqe5414/5/consoleFull

Line:598, scripts/install_utils.py -> It was same code as before. I have just added tuple (what you have given). Anyways, the install would fail if file is not downloaded properly, right? I think this optimization can be a different transaction to work on than current one?

Line:598, scripts/install_utils.py -> Every install step has a check-retry-timeout, so we can pinpoint the failure. Earlier this was a back up option, but if we want skip local download to be the default behavior, we do need check-retry-timeout for the download.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:598, scripts/install_utils.py -> Ok. Please see PS3 to see if this is what you are expecting. Job config would have options to choose and based on the slow/fast experience we can make right default option.
