DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6274: Wait for tasks by monitoring running_one_off/running_tasks

Improve the waiting for tasks function by using a timeout based approach
and monitoring the running_one_off/running_tasks dictionaries and the
progress bar.

These modifications will allow the test pass more successfully on slower
machines.

I like the overall approach, wondering if there is a need for a back off.
Line:4, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_base.py -> import should be in alphabetical order

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:4, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_base.py -> I will create a new issue which sorts the imports. I think I will also go for a single import per line approach which will probably result in more automatic merge conflict resolutions.
