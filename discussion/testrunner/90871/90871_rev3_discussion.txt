DESCRIPTION:

MB-28653: [FTS] Wait for all mutations to be indexed to handle updates

As part of wait_for_indexing_complete, check for num_mutations_to_index
to fall to zero at the very end as well - to handle the pure updates
usecase where the doc count remains unchanged.

I still see that updates can be tricky. There could be a case where updates have been made and DCP is about to tell us so the stat will still be 0, but like Marty said, I'm hoping the sleep will help. Thanks.
Line:3462, pytests/fts/fts_base.py -> You may want to enclose the while under "if item_count==None:" because there are cases where an item_count is passed and is not equal to the bucket count. Say a case where we want indexing to be in progress or reach 50% and then immediately start rebalance. In those cases, num_mutations_to_index will be non-zero but you still want to break from the loop.

Line:3465, pytests/fts/fts_base.py -> maybe print the stat value here to see if the number is indeed going down?
