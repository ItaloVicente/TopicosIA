@aruna Is there a way we can validate this really quick? Also let me know what you think about this solution.

Hi Abhinav, I like the proposal to check the stat, can we however move it to self.wait_for_indexing_complete() which is what all tests use? Thanks.

we only need to process the changes, we don't need to wait for them to be persisted to disk

i think it should be num_mutations_to_index

Aruna, I had recommended keeping it separate, as there is still a race condition here.  Let's say you load 100k docs, then call wait_for_indexing_to_complete, this stat might see 0 and think it's done, when in reality DCP hadn't even told us about any changes yet.  That is why I was thinking it was best to have the code sleep first, then call this new function, and finally still check that the doc count is what we expect.

Maybe there is a better way to incorporate all of this.
