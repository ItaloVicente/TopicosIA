Line:3, conf/py-newupgrade.conf -> what abt memcached bucket?

Line:10, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> move this to testconstants.py

Line:51, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> Move this to another method.. we are calling it 4 times in teh code already

something like.. 
def find_build(.......):
   BuildQuery().find_membase_build(builds, deliverable_type=self.info.deliver
able_type,...)

Line:11, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> use self.master

Line:40, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> you can get all buckets( rest.get_buckets()) and compare with expected buckets: set(rest.get_buckets()) == set(b).
so we get all the inconsistencies, not just the first

Line:47, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> tearDown should be after setup( code convenience )

Line:39, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> why do you initialize self.remote in setUp of newupgradebasetest and disconnect/destroy it in 'private' method? if you need this object only in this func you shouldn't declare it in setUp as global variable( or don't destroy it in the separate method). self.remote is used in _install(), but it can be destroyed

Line:46, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> does it make sense to add is_amazon as a func param?

Line:63, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> assert should be here also, if ns_server is not running it return false, and test will be failed in the next steps, but failure should be identified here

Line:74, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> use self.wait_timeout

@Rohit:

One thing we forgot was chain upgrade.. 
Its really easy.. check the old tests, we used upgrade_path param. 

1) 180-181-20
2) 172-180-181-20
3)172-181-20..
