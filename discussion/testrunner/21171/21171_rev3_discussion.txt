Line:25, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> you don't use self.bucketnames anywhere

Line:38, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> you can't create n bucket with self.quota. See basetestcase:
        if self.total_buckets > 0:
            self.bucket_size = self._get_bucket_size(self.quota, self.total_buckets)

Line:53, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> we have _load_doc_data_all_buckets with almost the same functionality in basetestcase. why we do not use that, and override it?

Line:14, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> move base func in NewUpgradeBaseTest

Line:34, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> move base func in NewUpgradeBaseTest

Line:66, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> for this test, firstly buckets will be created in setup func for initial build version, then new build will be installed and buckets will be created again?

Please check the comment on code review
Line:25, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> yes its redundant as we have bucket list in base class

Line:38, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> ???.. i have copied this statement from basetest class only, then why this comment.If it has been implemented differently please let me know and will implement the best.As i have tested this with n bucket as well and we can create 1 default and n number of SASL bucket

Line:53, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> You understand it correctly we have overridden it, as basetest class function lacks few flexibility such as providing starting number from where we want to load data, expiration of loaded data item.And handling of Memcached error.BaseTestcase class uses document generator while here we are using only blobgenerator.To avoid further confusion i will change the name of this function

Line:14, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> done

Line:34, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> done

Line:66, pytests/newupgradetests.py -> No, process is like base test case create buckets intially on latest build (which is liability of using base test case class if you are testing bucket creation test.Then clean up action happen i.e uninstalling the installed build and install the intial version which we want to get installed then if we have to test bucket creation we create buckets and then go for upgradation and verify whether the bucket exist or not.

Line:38, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> if your nodes have 4 GB of ram then initialize_nodes return ~ 2.5 GB. So you will create default bucket with 2.5, n standard buckets with 2.5 in each and the same value for sasl?

in basetestcase we count the bucket size(_get_bucket_size) that can be used to create 1 + n + m buckets. Am I wrong somewhere?

Line:53, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> okay, but if you handle MemcachedError, may occur a situation that you will be loading the same data 60 times, if you get Memcashed error 60 times. but it is a note for the future

Line:63, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> unneeded load=False

Line:38, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> In line number 39-40 we are calculating bucket size using basetestclass function only.
self.bucket_size = self._get_bucket_size(self.quota, self.total_buckets).
and then using same value everywhere to create any bucket whether it is default or sasl..

Line:63, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> sure
