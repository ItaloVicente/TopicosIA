Great work, we are close. Some things are still left, but the majority is just minor stylistic comments, which I thought I add, as you need to rework the patch anyway.
Line:40, conf/py-viewmerge.conf -> Those to tests need to run at the end of the test suite as they add docs that would make other tests fail.

I would add a comment like:

    # Keep those two tests at the end of the file, else any following tests would fail
    # as they add new values to the vBuckets.

Line:8, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> There should be an empty line here (between imports from Python Standard libs and the local ones should always be an empty line according to PEP-8).

Line:20, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> There should be an additional empty line before `class`.

Line:68, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> This looks like some leftover from debugging. Can it be removed?

Line:74, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> I think it would make more sense to populate the vbuckets on setup if first_case is true. This way you can run a single tests with testrunner when setting first_case and last_case, e.g.:

./testrunner -i b/resources/dev-4-nodes.ini -t viewmergetests.ViewMergingTests.test_keys,first_case=true,last_case=true

Line:92, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> you don't need to do 'params=xxx' any longer, you can just pass in the value directly. This is true for all occurrences.

Line:193, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> Please add an "else"-case when 'keys' is given. There all individual keys should be verified. I think the easiest way is to make a `set()` of the keys in `params` and a set of the resulting keys and check if both sets are the same (resp. the intersection is empty). sets are way faster than looping through both lists and check if the keys are in both.

Line:223, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> Don't we need to take self.is_dev_view into account here (and 5 lines below)?

Line:230, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> What is this `sleep` for? To wait until the docs are persisted? If that's the case I would use the `wait_for_persistence()` from the `RebalanceHelper` instead.

Given the comment on line 74, you can call the `create_ddocs()` function before the `populate_*` call, which does already wait for the persistence.

Line:314, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> `view_name` doesn't need to have '' as default value, it can just be `view_name`.

Line:74, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> The thing is that in setup nodes are rebalanced, bucket is created, it will take time(Filipe's requirement is that tests should pass quickly), so i just do it for the first test, and do clean up for the last test

Based on that I cannot add items in setup because we have tests for empty bucket

Line:193, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> verify_keys_are_sorted function verifies that keys are sorted only, no additional verifications will be performed. Query with 'keys' param should not be sorted
