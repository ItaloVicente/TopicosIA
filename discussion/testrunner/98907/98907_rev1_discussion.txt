Line:16, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_ansi_merge.py -> is there a particular need for suite setup and teardown. I have not looked at the code but if is suite here then it should happen at that test case.

Line:37, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_ansi_merge.py -> Please add more description to the test case, a quick list of steps.

Line:39, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_ansi_merge.py -> It seems that you need to have 2 buckets for joins, can you put this as part of setup? if bucket does not exist then simply create the bucket and start with the test

Line:592, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_ansi_merge.py -> what is the point of this one time declaration, when you are using it for the just the next statement. The merge into statement is also a hardcoded value.

Line:2, conf/tuq/py-tuq-ansi-merge.conf -> if Ansimerge tests require skip_load to True for all test cases, can you have that set in your base class.
