DESCRIPTION:

Fixed installation issues

Due to a recent change in on_prem_rest_client.py,
the initialisation of RestConnection object was
failing when a non test script was trying to
initialise the object. Since in our installation
scripts also uses RestConnection object,
TestInputSingleton object is None and hence the
scripts fail. Fixing this so that install scripts
work.
