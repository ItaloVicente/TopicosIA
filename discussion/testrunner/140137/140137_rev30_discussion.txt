Line:2782, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> My only issue with this method of testing it is that cbexport and cbbackupmgr backup share the same code so if there is a bug that causes it to export the data badly both will do it in the same way so we will not notice here.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:2782, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> I have added stronger checks which predicts collection, scope and document key in addition to predicting the index and the body.
