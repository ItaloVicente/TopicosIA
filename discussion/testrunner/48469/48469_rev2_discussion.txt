Looks good. One minor optimization can be done.

Thanks,

Line:2900, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> This can be moved after the check of src_active_passed, dest_active_passed, src_replicat_passed and dest_replica_passed. It only need to do verify_rev_ids when those checks passed. 

It is an optimization which makes failure case fails faster.

Line:2900, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> As discussed, this check was put in place as requested by Alk so we know which keys were missing and if updates were missing too (from revIDs).
