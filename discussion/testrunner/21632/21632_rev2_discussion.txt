DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-572: Enhancements to systest framework

Allow for shared broker across clusters
   * testcfg.py specify cluster name as prefix to queues

Better message routing
   * all tasks for each worker type has a specific route
     so that traffic will be isolated and not picked up
     by any worker listening to 'default' queue

Auto-delete unused queues
   * set auto-delete = True for all queues to have them
     removed when worker no longer needs them.

Support for using celeryd-multi to start several
worker instances on a single vm:
    * this is useful to protecting against losing
      jobs across the entire worker when an unrelated
      task crashes the worker.  I.E key-value loader crashes
      and stop collection is killed.

      examaple of starting 4 isolated workers on one vm with 2 process dedicated to each:

          celeryd-multi start kv query admin stats -A app --purge -l ERROR  -B -I:kv app.init \
          -n:kv kv -n:query query -n:admin admin -n:stats stats -c 2

      Where syntax (-n:kv  kv) means for worker named kv, start the kv scheduler , create it's queues and routes
      Note also init is only started once along with the kv worker, although it can be started as standalone.

      To start all types in a single worker do:

          celeryd-multi start all -A app --purge -l ERROR  -B  -n:all all -c 8

      One worker with two schedulers:

          celeryd-multi start kv query -A app --purge -l ERROR  -B -I:kv app.init \
          -n:kv kv -n:query query  -c 4
