DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-4004 : Fix the way we find the time when a failure was injected to a node in the Autofailover Tests.
Added new task that will calculate the exact time when a failure is injected to the node independently of the AutoFailoverNodeFailureTask. Now using the new task to find the exact time when the failure was injected and using it in the AutoFailoverNodeFailureTask to calculate the timeout period for the tests.
Also changed the way we stop memcached process in the Autofailover tests (instead of just killing the process, we are stopping the process and restarting it after the test is done).
