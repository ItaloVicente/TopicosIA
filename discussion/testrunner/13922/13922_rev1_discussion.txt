Line:9, testrunner -> I think so, but I'll check before I commit.

Would a feature check make more sense?  I saw that there was a lot of code using SQLite and reporting a version failure if SQLite wouldn't load (which is way incorrect).

When I looked at the options that was one of the possibilities. I think this case it's a little bit different though since we're not loading python. If it doesn't exist  then we can't even get here. Also, this function has existed since python 1.5.2. I'm open to other solutions if you think they're better though.

Oh.  No, that's not what I mean.  There's a reason you need 2.6.  Where possible, it's best to detect the feature you need.  As far as detecting the version, I think this is a good way to do it and reasonable.

That makes sense. In this case it looks like they changes the syntax in the way you declare a class? When I run with 2.4 I get a syntax error which seems pretty bad to me for a minor version change, but I don't know enough about python yet to know exactly what changed.
