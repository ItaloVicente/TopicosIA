DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-1182: recover non-deleted items from deactivated workload

This fixes an issue for the case that you want to delete all created documents.
Problem is the workload_manager is very proactive about queueing up a bunch of tasks before they are scheduled to run.  This pulls doc_ids from the queue.  If the workload is stopped (say post condition met), then the pulled doc_ids are lost and can never be deleted.
Here we requeue the docs when workload is deactivated
