DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6761: Fix missing attribute in test_one_off_incr_backup

In a loop during the test, backupset.objstore_staging_directory
is getting purged after each loop, due to the save and restore functions
not modifying external variables. The functions should be changed to
modify these as expected.

The staging_save and staging_restore functions were modifying a variable declared outside their scope, so since the previous_staging_directory variable was not an attribute of a class, this was never changing from its inital value of None.

This meant that when staging_restore was called later, it was always setting the current directory to None.
