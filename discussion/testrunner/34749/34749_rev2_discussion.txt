Currently tearDown() function deletes all the buckets after test is failed, and we loose the data files. We need to make some provision to run this script before bucket deletion is called.

That's a good idea too. For now this is a standalone script. Any comments?

hi Sangharsh,

we already have some params to do not clean cluster in teardown: skip_buckets_handle, stop-on-failure,  skip_cleanup
https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/blob/master/pytests/basetestcase.py#L162

but i don't think that we should collect data after every failure in ordinary cases. it may be gigabytes of data per case. besides, there were individual cases when developers want to look at the data.

Andrei, XdcrBaseTests don't have such provision to skip tearDown? Also, we don't need to skip tearDown() function, while we need to run tearDown function after the log-collection is done. 

And, We need such data files specially in case of XDCR verification failed (MB-10494). So, we can add such checks that data files will be collected only if XDCR data verification check failed.

-- not yet, but it's copy-paste


Also, we don't need to skip tearDown() function, while we need to run tearDown function after the log-collection is done.
-- currently we get log-collection after tearDown.

And, We need such data files specially in case of XDCR verification failed (MB-10494).
- seems like they did not need to Alk in the bug.
Also, Parag started to work with "compare data" scripts. but I did not see the script. purpose of obtaining data was to ensure that the data are synchronized, and the stats do not.

 So, we can add such checks that data files will be collected only if XDCR data verification check failed. 
--I think we will have more problems than the result.


I see this script will be useful only if: 
1. stop test on failure(don't run tearDown)
2. collect data files

as an improvement to the script:
1) location of data files could be different
2) doesn't work on windows(Mac?)
3) we can collect any folder ( logs,config, etc) via additional parameter
