DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6443: Backup Service upgrade testing

1. Take a set of backups from a previous version. Perform an offline
   upgrade. Introduce a backup service node. Import that repository into
   the backup service and perform a one off restore.

2. Perform an online upgrade using a swap rebalance. Introduce the
   backup service and take a one off backup.

Make the backup service base more composable. It's not possible to call
the tests inside the backup service test class as many attributes need
to be initialised by the enterprise backup and restore base case.
However, it's perfectly possible to setup a shared folder using NFS and
issue commands to the backup service.

Introduce a backup service hook that can be introduced into any class
and a backup service upgrade class.

Tests against 6.0.x, 6.5.x and 6.6.x.
