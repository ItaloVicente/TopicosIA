Earlier submitted tests passed. See at http://qa.sc.couchbase.com/job/test_suite_executor/187875/consoleFull and search for "system statistics from" to see the VMs statistics before and after running the tests.

Please move the code to basetestcase.py. Also think end to end, it is not possible to look at every test cases for server stats. Please expand the use case further to validate the stat at beginning and end, and assert if there is a leak in either memory or CPU stats.

I agree with Ritam that having this in the testrunner directly might not be completely useful. 
Also please reformat the commit message to be shorter and visible without scrolling.
Line:532, testrunner.py -> Avoid using print statements. Use the logger instead.

Line:581, testrunner.py -> Having this hear will print the statistics before the test setup is even done. Is this what is desired from this exercise?

Line:585, testrunner.py -> Why is this option even required?

Line:798, testrunner.py -> Running this here might not be completely useful. Since by this time, the test cleanup will have occurred and the statistics will not print the required stats after test is run. I believe that's the whole reason why this is being addes, i.e to know the server stats soon after any of the tests are run.

No need to change the test case or any place. It is done at testrunner harness level. The requirement was to see how the VM before starting the tests and at the end to see how VMs state is there. Additional health check and thresholds, we need to add but will do later in different transaction.

Formating at commit level -- will take care later.Usually, I do with -m "" at command level (may be vi can be used) and I think while doing --amend, I can edit.

See the responses...It looks like some confusion on the requirement side, which we can discuss in our meeting where I can clarify what is envisioned here and we can add more to make it more useful. The idea is to keep infrastructure issues out than the tests.
Line:532, testrunner.py -> This is purposefully done for pretty print to keep this text irrespective of log level. Because this is a note and don't want to miss.
Let us discuss in meeting.

Line:581, testrunner.py -> Yes. The ask was to print stats before tests started (because install is done separately). If VMs are not at proper level (looking at stats), there is no point to run the tests or debug further on the failures.  Health check/threshold would be even helpful. I will also double check with Raju when he asked about this.

Line:585, testrunner.py -> This is to check if given cluster is ok even before triggering the tests. Note that install or cluster setup is different and independent. Also, if wrong VMs are being picked up for testing can be checked first without even triggering the tests.  It is just convenient option to cross check ahead.

Line:798, testrunner.py -> These are the VM (OS level) stats. Basically to see the infrastructure issues if any to make sure stable (before or after) and expected ram/disk cleanup is done at the end or not.  We can discuss further in meeting.
