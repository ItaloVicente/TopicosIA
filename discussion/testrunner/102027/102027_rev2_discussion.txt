Patch Set 2:

Because of this patch Eventing runs over the weekend didn't go through. Sample error stacktrace:

Nov 26 07:44:23 test_create_mutation_for_dcp_stream_boundary_from_beginning (eventing.eventing_sanity.EventingSanity) ... Traceback (most recent call last):

Nov 26 07:44:23 KeyError: 'nodes'
Nov 26 07:44:23 ERROR


====

From quick look, fix seems simple. Would request to either fix the relevant issue or revert this patch.
