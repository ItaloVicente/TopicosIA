DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-5955: test_backup_merge false positive fix.

The test 'test_backup_merge' was passing despite an unsuccessful merge.

This commit introduces 3 changes:

1. The test “test_backup_merge” was resulting in a false positive due to the number of backups listed by the “cbbackupmgr info” command being counted incorrectly. The count was only incremented if the backup exists in the list of expected backups. If the backup doesn’t exist (an error condition), the counter is not incremented. The counter is now incremented in both circumstances.

2. Panic detection in backup logs for backup_merge if the check_for_panic flag is set.

3. Added additional functionality for checking for words in the backup logs and the showing lines before and after (e.g. to capture stack traces).
