DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-5955: test_backup_merge false positive fix.

The test 'test_backup_merge' was passing despite an unsuccessful merge.

This commit introduces 3 changes:

1. The test “test_backup_merge” was resulting in a false positive due to the number of backups listed by the “cbbackupmgr info” command being counted incorrectly. The count was only incremented if the backup exists in the list of expected backups. If the backup doesn’t exist (an error condition), the counter is not incremented. The counter is now incremented in both circumstances.

2. Panic detection in backup logs for backup_merge if the check_for_panic flag is set.

3. Added additional functionality for checking for words in the backup logs and the showing lines before and after (e.g. to capture stack traces).

Line:17, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please could you wrap this at 80 characters, in 'backup' where possible we try to wrap the commit messages at about 80 characters, however, there are some edge cases e.g. benchmarking output etc. In this case, the text could be wrapped without any issues.

Line:1418, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_base.py -> NITPICKING: You could do this with an fstring and avoid the assignment of 'words' above, and optionally 'command' here.

output, error = remote_client.execute_command(
    f"cat {self.backupset.directory}/logs/backup-*.log | grep '{'|'.join(word) if isinstance(word, list) else word}' -B {lines_before} -A {lines_after}"
)

Feel free to ignore, they both have their advantages/disadvantages IMO, fstrings are easier to read.

Line:1462, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_base.py -> Is it worth searching for something more refined than 'panic'? I don't think there are any "normal" occurrences of 'panic' in the logs but that might not always be the case. Feel free not to change, if you think it will be fine.

Line:1462, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_base.py -> NITPICKING: You can omit this, this is the default value for the lines_after_argument.

Line:2120, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_test.py -> NITPICKING: Could be an fstring again
