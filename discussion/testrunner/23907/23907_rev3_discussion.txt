DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-975: Paramiko stdout.read() hangs-large output

Paramiko stdout.read() hangs while executing a large output command

upgrade using rpm -i/ dpkg -i generates a large stdout and testrunner hangs in execute_command_raw on stdout.read()

        for line in stdout.read().splitlines():
            output.append(line)
https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/tree/master/lib/remote#L1155

I have no idea why channel approach is used in case of self.use_sudo, otherwise just self._ssh_client.exec_command(command)

Given that channel was added for sudo option did you try to test this patch against VMS which install script logs in with a non root user ?

before the patch it worked with non root user( jenkins user), didn't work for root. And I see the logic ( for non user uses sudo and channel, otherwise - exec_command directly). what differences we expect to get/or handle here between approaches of reading output? now for upgrade stout/err we use channel and it works for both user types.
