DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6239: Add a space between keys and values in regular expressions.

The fix:

Add a space between keys and values in regular expressions in'conf/entbackuprestore/entbackuprestore-regex-ssl.conf'

The why:

The primary reason is that cbbackupmgr requires the space in between the key and values as the unmarshalled documents it observes has spaces in between keys and values.

See CBQE-6239 for more details.
