Thanks for putting this together.

I spotted it linked from the CBSE so I thought I'd take a look and noted a few suggestions to improve the robustness / speed of the test - hope you don't mind the ninja review ;)
Line:160, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> Really shouldn't need a 60 sleep in /any/ test; why not just poll for the event you are interested in.

Line:712, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> You'll probably trigger this to happen more reliably if you use a smaller batch size and use multiple threads. For the record I was running with the following pillowfight config and managed to trigger visually every time:

 cbc-pillowfight -U 127.0.0.1:9000/default -m 100 -M 100 -u Administrator -P asdasd --rate-limit=10000 -t 10 -I 100000000

(Although in my case I just let pillowfight run in the background, hence essentially using an "infinite" item count).

Line:723, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> Style: prefer subprocess.call() over os.system(). You probably also want to check the exit status and fail if it's non-zero.

Line:737, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> A 10,000 element get-multi is probably going to be relatively expensive for the client (as it'll have to queue up that many operations). Do you find 100 / 1000 performs any better?

Line:755, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> Perhaps increase this to a high level than info() - warn() at least?

Line:769, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> From my testing you don't need anywhere near 1M items to start with - you can pretty much have the bucket with only a few 10,000 items in it; the important thing is the inserts must occur during the rebalance.

Line:775, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> Again, I don't believe there's a need to wait 30s after the rebalance; you can start the validation step as soon as the rebalance is complete.

Line:160, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> Thanks for catching this, I added this during local debugging, thought I removed it as patchset-2 but looks like I didn't.

Line:737, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> Actually, I can get 5-6 batches of 10k docs processed in a sec. Didn't find it to be too bad to try 1000 or 100.
