Couple more comments - it's probably acceptable if we need something immediately to test against; but I think we can still make this better; and additionally we need to also verify the document content, not just its presence. 

However as that will require more significant changes (moving away from pillowfight) maybe that can be done in a follow-up patch.
Line:717, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> Nit: Currently there's no minimum size needed for the document value, so if you wanted to reduce the resource requirements (both in terms of server RAM and network bandwidth) you could probably reduce this down to even 1 Byte.

Line:719, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> Style: Given all but the -u / -P arguments are identical between the two variations, more maintainable to define a baseCmd string, and just append -U / -p in the Spock case.

Line:751, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> Ideally we should also check that the value is the same one which was stored - i.e. for each key ("1," "2", "3", ...) store a value which is the same as the key; then check after rebalance they still match. Same for all metadata (datatype, flags, CAS, expiry, etc).

However I believe that will require using a different load generator to pillowfight, as pillowfight uses the same body for all documents.

I think what you have is probably ok for an initial v1; but we should look to get a more comprehensive checker asap.

Line:768, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> A 5s wait time seems pretty conservative; given you're running pillowfight without a rate-limit; and from my testing it can easily achieve 10k op/s on a single-node. 

Any reason to not reduce this significantly (say to 0.1s?)

Line:751, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> That is going to be handled separately by the tests Ritam and Vikas are writing now.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:768, pytests/rebalance/rebalancein.py -> I actually ran into  CCBC-916 on a slave. Now that I'm reverting to libc2.8.4, there's no need to wait to load 10k docs.
