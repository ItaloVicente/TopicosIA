DESCRIPTION:

Add an ldap TLS upgrade test

This basically starts a ldap container with TLS capabilities (setup)
with a root certificate. Since the test depends on starting docker,
it can be run only on specific VMs. For testing purpose, 172.23.122.100
is the VM which has docker installed - so it should be run here.

On a high level, these are the steps:
1. Setup a cluster with x509 certs with n2n encryption enabled
2. Setup an ldap configuration with the same root cert as the one on
CB cluster
3. Create an ldap user
3. Upgrade the CB cluster offline
4. Validate ldap user authentication works

Also, making the following unrelated changes to the file:
1. Take 2 input parameters: 'skip_rbac_internal_users_setup' and
'skip_ldap_external_user_setup'
2. Modularized the existing code by creating different functions for
a) setting and getting ldap config parameters
b) setting ldap config on cluster
c) Creating ldap external user
