This code is pending in review for a long time. Can we pls priortize this so we can add more upgradex509 tests. I have some on xdcr to complete by 05/15.
Line:24, pytests/security/x509tests.py -> I moved these earlier to the parent class. Do we need these here?

Line:588, pytests/security/x509tests.py -> On curls - I don't think we should be hard-coding curls. We have to find a way pass cacerts to an http library -
say -
h = httplib2.Http(ca_certs='/path/to/that/file')
or even requests if that is easy.

Line:588, pytests/security/x509tests.py -> I have used request here - https://github.com/couchbase/testrunner/blob/master/pytests/security/x509main.py#L216.

I will have both curl and python requests to validate. Current change wlll be to include both pem and cert for get part of requests

>I will have both curl and python requests to validate
Why is that? can we not do just python requests which uses http?

Line:65, pytests/security/x509main.py -> Add, maybe one-line comments above every method about what they do, since this concept of client and server can easily be misconstrued?
