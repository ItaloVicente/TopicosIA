Line:2391, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> what are your thoughts on separating this into separate methods:

enableLdapAuth

clearLdapAuth

addLdapUser

Correct it is one api, however I feel the actions performed in the method are disjointed.  i.e.
* clear ldap settings by passing in string = clear
* enable/disable ldap by passing in any value for authOperation -
      this is problematic as the user has to keep track if they already enabled or disabled since this will just do a flip of current settings
* add users
      users can be added, possibly removed.  and only if authOp is not clear otherwise we return prematurely.

These are some reasons I’d go with separating by actions as this api has many use cases

I understand what you are saying.  There is nothing called an ldap add or remove switch, what you pass from as parameters is blindly taken over as the command to request. 
Best I can do Tommie that I will move the clear to a different function and have one function to do all operation. To answer your question the ops, I have already tried this earlier, but it would just not set with current operations. Here is the original code that I had tried, where I would pick up the authOperation and userOperation as 2 diff switches, but as I said earlier this was not working well. If there was a modify method under PUT, I would have definitely taken up your recommendation. Plus I feel that code stays very clean if there is one point to change especially if we are dealing with a single api.  I have anyway segregated on the method of POST and GET. 
I can do that in my next change, but for now I would like to have this code check-in and get the sanity running. 
The code I am sharing had different operation but would need a lot of if/else conditions to maintain, but then I have better idea to control using my test data. 

def ldapRestOperation(self,authOperation,userOperation,user, userPriv):
        self.authOperation = authOperation
        self.userOperation = userOperation
        self.user = user
        self.param = None
        self.currAdmins = None
        self.currROAdmin = None
        value = self.ldapRestOperationGET()
        self.jvar = []
        
        api = self.baseUrl + "/settings/ldapAuth"
        
        if (authOperation == "clear"):
            status, content,header = self._http_request(api, 'POST')
            return status
        
        if (authOperation != None):
            self.authOperation = authOperation
        else:
            self.authOperation = value['enabled']        
        self.currentAdmins  =  value['admins']
        log.info ("Current value of {0}".format(self.currentAdmins))
        self.currentRoAdmin = value['roAdmins']
        
        for j in self.currentAdmins[:]:
            self.currAdmins = self.currentAdmins.pop()
        
        for k in self.currentRoAdmin[:]:
            self.currROAdmins = self.currentRoAdmin.pop()
      
        if (userOperation == "add" and userPriv == "Admin"):
            if (self.currAdmins != None):
                self.currAdmins.append(user)
            else:
                self.currAdmin = user
        else:
            if (self.currROAdmin != None):
                self.currROAdmin.append(user)
            else:
                self.currROAdmin = user
        
        if (userOperation == 'remove' and userPriv == "Admin"):
            if (self.currAdmins != None):
                log.info("value of Admins is {0}".format(self.currAdmins))
                #self.currAdmin = ''
                self.currAdmins.pop()
            #self.currAdmins.remove(user)
        else:
            if (self.currROAdmin != None):
                self.currROAdmin.remove(user)
            
                
            
        #for l in self.currentAdmins:
        #    log.info ("into for loop")
        #    log.info ("value of currentAdmin {0}".format(l))
            

        #for l in self.k:

        #self.currentAdmins.remove('bjones')
        #self.k.remove('bjones')
        
        
        if (userOperation != None):
            fullAdmin = userList['FullAdmin']
            roAdmin = userList['ROAdmin']
            adminList = "'" + fullAdmin + "'"
            roAdminList = "'" + roAdmin + "'"
        #    for user in userList:

        #param = param + self.fullAdmin + adminList + "," + self.roAdmin + roAdminList + "," + "'username':'Adminisrator','password':'password'}"

        log.info ("status of the request is {0}".format(status))
        log.info ("value of header is {0}".format(header))
    '''
Line:2391, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> I would like to keep everything in one function since the code the URL is same.  Had there been different URL fro different operations i would have broken up into multiple functions.

Just to be clear, I agree to all you comments and would have done the same, if the API would have been more robust. For this particular case I would rather control it via my test data rather than API, as the code would become complex to maintain and understand.

That's fine, provide your final changes and this can be a good starter and we'll go from here.

Ideally I'd like something like this:

Since this api is likely to change that may be worth revisiting.  Thanks Ritam!

refactored with single api entry point - the helper methods just collect params:   https://friendpaste.com/1kx387gQNVL9q4RM217KBo

Thank Tommie. I will move out the change for clearing the settings in my next push, I will have to change my test cases as well. For now I will stick to this plain code and send you next set of code early next week for a quick review. 
Thanks again Tommie.
