DESCRIPTION:

2i - Add a check to verify cluster status in test_rebalance_in

Before performing after recovery tasks, there is no check if the
cluster is in healthy state. Check if all the nodes in the cluster
are healthy before doing any post recovery task.

Change Query Definition to remove dead code and recategorize
queries into various groups.

Line:79, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Don't we need to verify that cluster is healthy in rebalance out scenario's too?

Line:232, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Intentional?

Line:393, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Intentional? If so, why?

Line:79, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> This should be there in all recovery scenarios. I am starting with rebalance_in.

Line:232, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Yes. With current design, replica indexes are being created in setup itself because of which, this method fails creating indexes since duplicate index already exists.

Line:393, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Yes. Same reason as above

Line:232, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Then just delete the line instead of commenting it out? Keeps the code cleaner.

Line:3402, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> nitpick - would sound better as "fix for MB-20758" or "workaround for MB-20758"

Line:765, pytests/2i/base_2i.py -> this will exit the for loop and set is_cluster_healthy to True which will exit the while loop - please correct the logic
