I will be good to see implementation of any test from range 20-24.

Line:62, pytests/failover/AutoFailoverAbortsRebalance.py -> I do not see any time related check here, i.e., rebalance should fail or be interrupted by auto-failover within "auto-failover timeout + 1min"  (1min is a number pulled from thin air to signify that we need sometime after auto-failover timeout for node to be failed over, can be changed to protect against false negatives). 

This is perhaps the crux of auto-failover interrupting rebalance. If rebalance fails after say one hour this test would pass, which is wrong.

Line:78, pytests/failover/AutoFailoverAbortsRebalance.py -> The info log should also contain a message, " Rebalance interrupted due to auto-failover of nodes [Nodes_being_failed_over]" . 
This is a better check .

Line:62, pytests/failover/AutoFailoverAbortsRebalance.py -> Basically we do have check where auto failover is supposed to happen in autofailover timeout + MAX_FAIL_DETECT_TIME(defined in line 18)

Since we do check that rebalance is aborted and autofailover happens within the autofailover timeout, the rebalance part is automatically taken care. If not the test would fail saying that Autofailover did not happen within specified time.
