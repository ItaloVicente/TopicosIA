DESCRIPTION:

[4/n] Add framework needed for provider agnostic cloud testing

Supported cloud providers are abstracted away through the abstract class
'Provider'. The 'Provider' currently only facilitates in the
setup/teardown, however, in the future will provide methods for fetching
files from the object store for validation.

NOTE: Validation of data is planned to be done using cbriftdumps native
cloud integration e.g. no data files should be downloaded using the
'Provider'.
