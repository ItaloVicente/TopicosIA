DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-4024 : Fix rebalanceinout p1 tests that is causing the cluster to be split causing testf failures after it.
Changed the nodes initialized for the test. Since earlier only 3 nodes were initialized and we were removing 3 nodes in the test, the initial nodes were replaced with new 2 new nodes and hence causing a cluster split.
