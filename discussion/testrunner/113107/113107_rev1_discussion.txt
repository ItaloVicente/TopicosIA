Line:2868, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> There are already the following methods available in the rest_client.py :
stop_fts_index_update
freeze_fts_index_partitions
disable_querying_on_fts_index
enable_querying_on_fts_index

Are they not re-usable ?

Line:2868, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> hmm .. did not suspect there would be these methods. 
freeze method here is not right. we need to update. 
There is no unfreeze, resume method.
As these are NOT used anywhere, can we remove these methods ???.

The advantage of current method (call_index_management_api) i see is no duplication. One method does all the operations based on the params passed.

Line:2868, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Drawback of having a generic method in a library - if someone else has to use it, it is difficult to understand the use of this method. 

Suggestion is to document the use with an example.
Also rename it to fts_index_management_api - without fts in the name, its not easy to figure out which index is this about.

My first preference would be to have separate individual methods for each API.

Sure, will update based on this --> My first preference would be to have separate individual methods for each API.
