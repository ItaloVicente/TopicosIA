DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6400: Do not sort the servers.

Remove the sorting of the cluster list.

Sorting the cluster list has unintentional side effects as a consequence
of how testrunner uses this lists.

It's best not to shuffle the elements in these lists of servers.

Sorting was previously done to avoid the sitatuion in which a server of
low memory was being added to a server with high memory causing the add
node to fail. This is because services share the memory requirements
between nodes. The server with less memory cannot satisfy the memory
requirements of the server with more memory due to the way testrunner
configured the quotas of the services.

Instead, to form a cluster simply assign the correct quotas based on the
node with the lowest available memory. A much more elegant approach.
