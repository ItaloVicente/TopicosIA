Line:665, lib/couchbase_helper/documentgenerator.py -> Can this be done outside of this class .. may be we can write a wrapper method which transforms dataset=emp to self.json_template=Emp and self.key_prefix="emp"

Line:672, lib/couchbase_helper/documentgenerator.py -> if someone pass start=10, then end also should be passed or else it will be end=0, is that okay ? this case to be looked into
whats the differnce b/w start_seq_num and start?
whats the difference b/w end and num_ops?
is it possible to derive from start and end from start_seq_num, num_ops, percent_create/delete in SDKLoader class itself so we can avoid extra params.

Line:4344, pytests/fts/fts_base.py -> I guess here you can pass jsonTemplate=Emp based on dataset instead of passing dataset. If this is not common code, then having seperate method is preferred.

And also note that we need to handle wiki, napa and earthquake dataset also in the loader

Line:37, pytests/fts/stable_topology_fts.py -> Basically "None" is being passed here: self.load_data(generator=gen_create)
