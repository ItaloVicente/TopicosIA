Line:814, pytests/tuqquery/n1ql_collections_ddl.py -> Remove this hardcoding as well. Pls scan the whole test script any hard coding

Line:827, pytests/tuqquery/n1ql_collections_ddl.py -> Create a library method to drop collection using N1QL and use that here. This library method should also have a validation for the same.

Line:828, pytests/tuqquery/n1ql_collections_ddl.py -> This is not required once the above line is replaced with a library method

Line:849, pytests/tuqquery/n1ql_collections_ddl.py -> You do not need an index to insert a doc. This line can be removed. Index is required for updating and upserting docs.

Line:853, pytests/tuqquery/n1ql_collections_ddl.py -> Remove hardcoding

Line:881, pytests/tuqquery/n1ql_collections_ddl.py -> We discussed about moving this to the common collections code so that it can be leveraged by other tests as well

Line:914, pytests/tuqquery/n1ql_collections_ddl.py -> We discussed about removing this method and using the method provided by the testrunner framework
