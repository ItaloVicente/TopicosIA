Line:2578, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> as a side note you can share a lot of the test setup, aka create jsut one backup that has all and then use the advance restore options to only restore the things you want and check it works.

Line:2578, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> I could share a common test setup where I create everything in one go and use the advanced restore option to restore a specific thing.

I could also encapsulate the concept of creating something, deleting it and checking if it exists.

But since it's a test case, I prefer my current approach. Everything is explicit and nothing is hidden.

More importantly, I'll modify the test cases to use the advanced restore options to make sure they work as well.
