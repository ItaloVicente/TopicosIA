Thanks :) This was a lot better than the old version :D (but one of the tests still printed out a lot of output to me..) 

I think it would be better if this was added to the simple-test target, and the logs enabled by passing VERBOSE=1 (which is how you get verbose output running make in the toplevel cmake/directory (which will be promoted to the top level once we're done with the transition to cmake)
Line:28, Makefile -> It would be better if this is the default, and people could run a dedicated target _IF_ they want the console to be verbose. 

It would be nice if it printed out where the output is located when starting the test, so that I could cat it if I'm wondering if the test is stuck or not..

Line:29, Makefile -> you could use @echo to avoid "echo" to be printed...

Line:30, Makefile -> instead of CRITICAL you should pass ${VERBOSE}

Line:47, scripts/start_cluster_and_run_tests.sh -> if you add ${VERBOSE} in the makefile, you would have to "flip" this, and check for the value (and replace its value with the correct values)
