File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> looks good to me Jake. I would suggest to have +2 from Girish.
I am not sure if you need this but we should populate the (DN)servers/ports information somewhere on which each database is hosted. While creating memcahced connection and doing stats validation that would be helpful.

Now, cluster.servers and cluster.master concept is over for serverless databases. Better to have database.servers -> nebula servers where bucket is hosted.

But if the plan is to write a complete independent tests with no use of existing functionalities then this sanity test looks fine to me.

Line:70, pytests/serverless/serverless_basetestcase.py -> It would be good to mimic the existing basetestcase class. I understand all of the code might not be relevant, but perhaps we can have the dataload methods (related to java_sdk_client) and all the associated instance config variables added? This would be easier for the consumers such as GSI to directly use this. Since data load is required by pretty much every component, it makes sense to have it here. get_services_map and the corresponding instance variables could also be useful since the consumers would quite possibly use the rest interfaces for their components. 

So to summarise, if the basetestcase can provide the java sdk client and the rest objects, it would be great.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:70, pytests/serverless/serverless_basetestcase.py -> Support for REST APIs has been added. Data load will be handled with a different PR.
