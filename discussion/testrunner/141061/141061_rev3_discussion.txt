DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6136: Amend history tests

As backups made in chesire-cat are always collection aware. Previously
this was not the case and when trying to examine a collection unaware
backup using a collection string, you would receive a warning. As it's
no longer possible to obtain this warning, I have amended this test to
check that a backup which does not explicitly contain a collection can
be examined using a bucket only string and also with a bucket suffixed
with '_default._default'.

Amend a test in the conf file where test name was spelled incorrectly.
