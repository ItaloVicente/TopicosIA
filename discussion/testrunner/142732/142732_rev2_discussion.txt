DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6273: Amend get_leader() method to receive a list of clusters

The get_leader() method searches the logs for who the current leader is.
The logs of all the nodes in the cluster are searched. If a node is
removed, but present in the list of clusters, the get_leader() method
will return an incorrect leader.

To amend this, we can supply a list of nodes which are currently in the
cluster to get_leadr().
