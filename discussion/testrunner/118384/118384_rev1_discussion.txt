DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-5244: fix the update to happen immediately after cleanup and also refactored for modularity. commented rpm rebuilddb because it is breaking and need reboot. I will add checks for rpm later. At this time rpm would hang if there is a rpm db issue during cleanup.

Line:70, scripts/fix_failed_install.py -> What are the other states like failedInstall ?

Line:89, scripts/fix_failed_install.py -> Not returning out value here

Line:91, scripts/fix_failed_install.py -> Not returning out value here

Line:93, scripts/fix_failed_install.py -> Not returning out value here

Line:96, scripts/fix_failed_install.py -> this needs to check for each and every out statement returned above, not only out2

Talked to Mihir and explained the context. The original code had all these issues. I was in the middle of the changes and want to add this code change so that manual run is not required. Also note that not simply returning and checking the status code for all commands is not sufficient and instead to detect and do only when required and also parse the output to cross check before concluding that that current state is indeed the desired state. It has more work..I am not closing the ticket until this is done. Thanks.
Line:70, scripts/fix_failed_install.py -> Earlier, I had found failInstall_slow. To cover this, I have added like.

Line:89, scripts/fix_failed_install.py -> This is same as before (not checking the value but printing). The change is incremental and more changes will be done. At this time, it is mainly to fix the current issue of breaking along with some modularization.

Line:91, scripts/fix_failed_install.py -> This is same as before (not checking the value but printing). The change is incremental and more changes will be done. At this time, it is mainly to fix the current issue of breaking along with some modularization.

Line:96, scripts/fix_failed_install.py -> I will be doing that when I make the other changes. This is same as before (not checking the value but printing). The change is incremental and more changes will be done. At this time, it is mainly to fix the current issue of breaking along with some modularization.
