I often see `params["full_set"] = "true"` in the code. Would it make sense to make it the default? I think if I would use Couchbase without knowing anything about it, I would expect a query/request to return the full set.
Line:257, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> I wouldn't store the bucket name in some variable.

Line:287, pytests/viewquerytests.py -> Here you can reuse the bucket variable :)

In a different commit your comment on full_set was the opposite. For development views this needs to be set and we happen to be using development views in all of these test cases. I think it would be wrong to add this as the default in the ViewHelper class. Maybe I should add a function in the ViewTests that adds this for you automatically. What do you think?

Sorry, sorry, sorry. I got confused by the 'dev_' prefix. I thought it was arbitrarily chosen. I forgot that Couchbase has a distinction between development and production views.

I agree, adding "full_set=true" to the dev views by default would be wrong. Adding it to ViewTests automatically sounds good.

You should talk to the SDK people, what they plan to do with views, perhaps they've spent already some thought on it.

The inline comments are still valid, but not really a blocker.
