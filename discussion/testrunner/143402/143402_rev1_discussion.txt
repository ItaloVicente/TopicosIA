DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6327: Use polling to determine when backup service is ready

Using polling to determine when the backup service is ready to respond
to http requests as opposed to sleeping in the killing the backup
service test.

Move the test near to prevent it from interfering with the other tests
in the conf file as it changes the time potentially breaking stats.
