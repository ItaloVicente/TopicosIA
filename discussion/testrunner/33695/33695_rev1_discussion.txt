workflow all looks ok, but there's some issues in the specs.  Make sure whenever you use 'coq' that the queue specified has keys in it.  Meaning the queue was previously a ccq in an earlier workload.   Unless you really need cache miss you probably don't need coq (consume_queues).

Also, check white-space and tabs.
Line:4, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_offline_upgrade.js -> loop requires string.  ""

Line:21, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_offline_upgrade.js -> invalid coq (consume_queue), there aren't any items in sasl9keys queue.  ccq is all you need here

Line:56, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_offline_upgrade.js -> coq also invalid here.  only saslkeys and  sasl19keys have data

Line:6, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_online_upgrade.js -> try to replace tabs with spaces

Line:21, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_online_upgrade.js -> should be ->   coq:saslkeys

Line:28, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_online_upgrade.js -> coq: saslkeys

Line:32, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_online_upgrade.js -> expect lots of set/get failures if removing coucbase during workload.  node is not removed until next phase

Line:38, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_online_upgrade.js -> coq:saslkeys

Line:46, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_online_upgrade.js -> tabs

Line:54, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_online_upgrade.js -> ok for now - i think we'll need a solution for build versions

Line:55, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_online_upgrade.js -> try not to have white spaces

Line:63, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_online_upgrade.js -> coq:saslkeys

Line:150, pysystests/tests/upgrade/xdcr/source_online_upgrade.js -> rm all ws

Tommie, I remember you saying coq will be deprecated soon. Or was it ccq? in which case we can remove coq or ccq altogether. 

Parag, there are no post-upgrade phases. Can we add rebalance-in, out, failover and restart phases?

i'd like to get rid of both - these are workload helpers for cache miss scenarios.  when there is better load logic these will not be necessary, still if you want misses today coq is suggested way to go about it
