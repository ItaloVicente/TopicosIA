DESCRIPTION:

MB-39535: Exit with non-zero status when test exits with error.

When test raise an exception and test is running in a forked process then while waiting for that child process to finish, it raises an OSError exception.

We were catching that exception and ignoring it rather than exiting with a non-zero status

Line:1022, testrunner.py -> Ritesh, Why -1 as exit code? Still non-zero but not expected in Python/shell world. Typically, 0 for success and 1 for non success or any other 1-127 code.

https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html
"The optional argument arg can be an integer giving the exit status (defaulting to zero), or another type of object. If it is an integer, zero is considered “successful termination” and any nonzero value is considered “abnormal termination” by shells and the like. Most systems require it to be in the range 0–127, and produce undefined results otherwise. Some systems have a convention for assigning specific meanings to specific exit codes, but these are generally underdeveloped; Unix programs generally use 2 for command line syntax errors and 1 for all other kind of errors. If another type of object is passed, None is equivalent to passing zero, and any other object is printed to stderr and results in an exit code of 1. In particular, sys.exit("some error message") is a quick way to exit a program when an error occurs."

Jagadesh, updated the change with the error message.

From the link you shared:
In particular, sys.exit("some error message") is a quick way to exit a program when an error occurs.

And when the above executes, the return value is 1.
Line:1022, testrunner.py -> Ack
