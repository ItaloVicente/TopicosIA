DESCRIPTION:

Adding more test cases for LDAP, refactored code in rest_client.py. There is still some work pending for having LDAP config in ini file and dynamic adding of LDAP users.
Made changes to call rebalance directly, added finally block to server code and removed unncessary usage of assert statements
Change-Id: I6e1f95de75cc7ad35a8b759fe45750c917cd3404

Line:2490, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> still don't understand why you cannot do 1 line 
return if (status ['status'] == "400" and login == False)
instead of 4

Line:129, pytests/security/ldaptest.py -> extra whitespaces

Line:176, pytests/security/ldaptest.py -> whitespaces

Line:420, pytests/security/ldaptest.py -> there is no need in resetting cluster, tear down will do it for you

Line:422, pytests/security/ldaptest.py -> whitespaces

Line:448, pytests/security/ldaptest.py -> whitespaces
and a typo: reblance fn, not async_rebalance

Line:479, pytests/security/ldaptest.py -> whitespaces and also below

Line:557, pytests/security/ldaptest.py -> shell should be defined prior to try block, otherwise finally won't see it

Line:572, pytests/security/ldaptest.py -> same as above

Line:581, pytests/security/ldaptest.py -> same
