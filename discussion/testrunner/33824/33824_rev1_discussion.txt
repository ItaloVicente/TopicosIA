I'm happy to see less config files, I've one question though.

Ketaki, e.g. the py-regression_view.conf contains tests with way larger numbers. Do they normally also always pass (like the ones with smaller numbers)? Might it make sense to have longer running tests as well? Or is it something that will be added later one (cleanup up first, revisiting what's really needed next?).

Good point Volker.

Py-regression_views. was not being actively run on any Jenkins jobs. By numbers, you mean - item_count? If yes -  yes, the plan is to cleanup first and then enhance/add or as recommended above have larger tests inplace of existing tests.
