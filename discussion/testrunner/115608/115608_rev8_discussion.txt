Line:3957, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_test.py -> can we validate if the auto selected number of threads  correspond to the number of cores in the machine?

Line:3995, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_test.py -> I think you meant invalid range here?

Line:4113, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_test.py -> same as above

Line:3957, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_test.py -> This can get tricky as it is not just the number of cores in the machine, but the number of cores available to the process. This is because in docker, kubernetes and other VM/Container technologies you are allowed to limit the number of CPUs a process can run on. It is also worth noting that we dont set the number of threads to be equal to the number of cores but instead use the folowing formula:

threads = max(1, floor[NUM_CORES *  0.75]).

I am not sure of a reliable way to test this for the specific cbbackupmgr process.

Line:3995, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_test.py -> No, that is an invalid date format as it is using mm-dd-yyyy (no 30th month) instead of dd-mm-yyyy which is the allowed format

Line:4113, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_test.py -> Same as before I am testing that the format using in the range won't accept mm-dd-yyyy but only dd-mm-yyyy
