Line:3167, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> So I think lines 3162 to 3166 can go into an entire new function called 'generate_authentication_failures'

Line:3171, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> You could use a Counter object (from collections import Counter)

event_count = Counter()

Line:3177, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> Perhaps here it would be neater to extract json.loads(line) into a variable so you wouldn't have to fetch the last element in the list on line 3179.
e.g.

event = json.loads(line)

Line:3183, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> Because a Counter has the default value of 0 for every key, we can remove this entire try except block and simply do the following:

event_count[event] += 1

Line:3187, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> Would removing the if event['id'] in range(45056, 45064) potentially break one of the below assertions?

Is there an event['id'] for the authentication failure?

I believ
Line:3187, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> Auth failure does have an ID, although it's not within the range specified.
I believe this filter exists just to make seen_events smaller by limiting it to specific events (which up until now had very similar IDs)
Considering seen_events shouldn't feasibly get big enough for the size to matter in this test, combined with the need to add a new ID to the 'whitelist' every time we track a new audit, I think we're better off jsut recording all the events.
(We don't care about the specific IDs anywhere else)
