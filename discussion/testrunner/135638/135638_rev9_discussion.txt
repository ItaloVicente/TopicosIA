DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6049: Backup Plan Tests

Implement the backup plan test:

A user cannot Add/Update a Plan with Tasks containing incorrect
(negative, out of range, non-existing values, empty/long, missing,
illegal characters) types, schedules, merge options or full backup flag.

A user can Add/Update a plan with Tasks containing correct types,
schedule values, merge options or full backup flag on Add/Update Plan.
(Consequently, a user can retrieve their plans).

A user can delete a Plan not currently tied to a repository.

A user cannot delete a Plan currently tied to a repository.

A repository with a plan backs up the specified services in the plan
(e.g. data, index, eventing …) (TODO)

A user can insert a plan with:
A large number of Tasks
No Tasks.

A user can insert a large number of plans with a large quantity of
Tasks.  If there is a hard limit on the number of plans/tasks, we can
test for it by creating max + 1 (Pavithra). (The max limit is 14 Tasks
in a Plan).  Test ‘used by’ n repositories after tying Plan to n
repositories.
