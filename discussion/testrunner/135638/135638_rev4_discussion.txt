DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6049: Backup Plan Tests

Implement the backup plan test:

A user cannot Add/Update a Plan with Tasks containing incorrect
(negative, out of range, non-existing values, empty/long, missing,
illegal characters) types, schedules, merge options or full backup flag.

A user can Add/Update a plan with Tasks containing correct types,
schedule values, merge options or full backup flag on Add/Update Plan.
(Consequently, a user can retrieve their plans).

A user can delete a Plan not currently tied to a repository.

A user cannot delete a Plan currently tied to a repository.

A repository with a plan backs up the specified services in the plan
(e.g. data, index, eventing …) (TODO)

A user can insert a plan with:
A large number of Tasks
No Tasks.

A user can insert a large number of plans with a large quantity of
Tasks.  If there is a hard limit on the number of plans/tasks, we can
test for it by creating max + 1 (Pavithra). (The max limit is 14 Tasks
in a Plan).  Test ‘used by’ n repositories after tying Plan to n
repositories.

Line:84, lib/backup_service_client/models/task_template.py -> Could straight up delete this as If False and X always evaluates to false

Line:113, lib/backup_service_client/models/task_template.py -> same here

Line:7, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> This is nitpicking but Python convention suggest builtin library imports should go before others.

Line:35, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> I would suggest adding test where the body is not even a plan e.i [Non json body] such as potato or invalid json see what happens. as well as invalid types such as instead of string descriptiontry a float and same for the services.

Line:173, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> try a float or a string

Line:297, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> number

Line:84, lib/backup_service_client/models/task_template.py -> Okay so I kind of wanted to hold on to the logic to disable client sided value/error checking because I wanted to add a flag which enables or disables it globally.

In that case I would replace False with something like Config.client_error_check_enabled.

Line:35, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> 1. Added the case where the Body is not even a Plan, you get "json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type value.Plan" as the error.

2. Added case where the description is a number.

3. Added case where the service is a string/number/a list containing a number instead of a list.
