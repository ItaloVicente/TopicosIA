Line:67, conf/fts/py-fts-custmap-rqg-queries.conf -> Can you share the distribution of the randomness in the index definition? By that I mean, can you share the testrunner log of the index definition for some of these tests. This is just to ensure we're not over-doing the number of tests for any unique combination.

Line:77, pytests/fts/custom_map_generator/map_generator.py -> Break lines > 80 chars. Here the comment can be moved above too.

Line:82, pytests/fts/custom_map_generator/map_generator.py -> can this entire segment be rewritten as -

while len(self.custom_analyzers) < num_custom_analyzers:
      #body

for readability?

Line:263, pytests/fts/custom_map_generator/map_generator.py -> Another way of writing this if is "if self.num_custom_analyzers:" but this is fine too. Just fyi.

Line:323, pytests/fts/custom_map_generator/map_generator.py -> what is the role of 'n' here?

Line:327, pytests/fts/custom_map_generator/map_generator.py -> why is this line needed?

Line:218, pytests/fts/es_base.py -> break line pls

Line:221, pytests/fts/es_base.py -> since the 'map' definition alone marks the difference between this method and above, would it make sense to reuse the previous method and make es_mapping and fts_mapping as dummy params to the same method? Like, add the too params as arguments defaulting to 'None' and then an if condition inside to define "map". Rest of the code is same.

Line:238, pytests/fts/es_base.py -> Pls add method description for readability.

Line:601, pytests/fts/fts_base.py -> break line

Line:2763, pytests/fts/fts_base.py -> made a related comment on es_base.py

Line:327, pytests/fts/stable_topology_fts.py -> pls remove
