Line:145, pytests/2i/aggregate_pushdown_upgrade_2i.py -> This line of code will not be executed if the previous assert fails. Since both of them are not related, it would be good to move the index partitioning related method to some other test, maybe where gsi rebalance is used.

Line:145, pytests/2i/aggregate_pushdown_upgrade_2i.py -> Sure. I'll have to change the index created and the scans as discussed in meeting. But I'll move it to the original upgrade job.
