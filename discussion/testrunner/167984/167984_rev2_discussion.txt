DESCRIPTION:

Fixed the merge issue with test reports

Due to a recent change in testrunner, we added
new parameters in the tests that caused the
merge of test reports to not work as expected.
Fixed the issue by adding the new parameters
into filter list.

Good catch. I have made changes in testrunner for now. I will send another patch refactoring the code like you suggested. But that needs a bit more testing to make sure that it doesn't break the code. So for now, lets patch this up so that jobs are unblocked.
