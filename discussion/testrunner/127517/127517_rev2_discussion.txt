Hi Pavithra,

I don't know what QE's typical coding standards / review practices are, so I treated this as how I'd review code in KV-Engine - see inline comments.

Also - given this has been manually verified (as opposed to using automated Commit Validation), I would expect to see some details of _how_ it was verified - by inspection? running some specific tests? (and if so a link to the results if available would be helpful).
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Which missing attribute?

There's not much information in this commit message as to what and why the change is being made. That makes it difficult for the reader (the reviewer now, or anyone looking at this code in the future) to understand the reason for this change.

I find that https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ is a good article on the topic of Git commit messages.

Line:2602, pytests/xdcr/xdcrnewbasetests.py -> This appears to be an exact duplicate of the `wait_interval` method.

1. Can we just define one in terms of the other to avoid the code duplication?
2. I assume that one of these methods is preferred over the other (and hence once should be deprecated in future - say using https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#DeprecationWarning, or at least a comment in the code to the reader?
