DESCRIPTION:

MB-8295: Test dev views

This change will make it possible to test dev views.

Development views just return a subset of the data. When you
query a dev view with "full_set=true", it will use the
production view and return the full set.

Hence I disable setting "full_set" by default, so that we can
trigger dev views.

Production views will also be used if the number of documents
is to low. Therefore the test_dev_view() puts additional documents
into the database to overcome this amount.

Line:46, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> how come this is False, and then set True the next line?

Line:46, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> It's to define dev as well as production views without duplicating too much code. Better approaches are welcome :)

Line:46, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> to put into config is_dev_view = false and test all cases with production, then put is_dev_view=true and test development views

Line:46, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> That will fail Iryna.

The purpose here is to test dev views without full_set=true. This means the server (ns_server) chooses only 1 vbucket to index. Therefore many existing tests will fail, because they won't see some data indexed that they expect.

Volker's test is for a very specific scenario.

Line:46, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> To add to Filipe's comment: The verification for the dev views is really minimal, it just checks if the result is a subset of the full dataset. You can't be sure which data exactly it contains.

So when you would add add e.g. the startkey and endkey parameter, the result could either be smaller or the same size. Hence you couldn't really verify if the dev view is broken or not when it returns the same result as without the parameter, as it:

1. works as expected and within this single vBucket the dev view uses the startkey/endkey doesn't make a difference
2. it is broken and the startkey/endkey paramaters are ignored

To conclude: it's good that there are specific tests for dev views.

Line:46, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> I would just add additional check into verifying results func, instead of creating a new one and creating both types of documents.

Line:46, pytests/viewmergetests.py -> The setup is only run once for the whole test suite (that's the `if 'first_case`), hence both need to be created here.
