DESCRIPTION:

MB-8295: Test dev views

This change will make it possible to test dev views.

Development views just return a subset of the data. When you
query a dev view with "full_set=true", it will use the
production view and return the full set.

Hence I disable setting "full_set" by default, so that we can
trigger dev views.

Production views will also be used if the number of documents
is to low. Therefore the test_dev_view() puts additional documents
into the database to overcome this amount.
