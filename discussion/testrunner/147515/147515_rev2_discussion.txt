Line:3, conf/fts/py-upgrade-fts.conf -> Did we check the tests we wanted to in mixed mode manually if they are fine?

Line:96, pytests/fts/upgrade_fts.py -> Before upgrade, are we loading buckets with some docs and creating indexes?It would be good make sure the indexes created before upgrade are still intact.

Line:163, pytests/fts/upgrade_fts.py -> Same as previous comment.

Before upgrade, are we loading buckets with some docs and creating indexes?It would be good make sure the indexes created before upgrade are still intact.

Line:2, conf/fts/py-upgrade-fts.conf -> I guess we should have 3 offline tests covering all the releases: 6.0.5, 6.5.2 and 6.6.1 and one with online upgrade.
