(35 comments)
Line:159, lib/mc_bin_client.py -> I think its better to add collection argument to the end instead of middle. I think there might be cases where this method is invoked using positional arguments instead of keyword arguments. Its ok if you have already validated all the usages of these methods. If you have , you can ignore this comment.

Line:842, lib/mc_bin_client.py -> You can remove this.

Line:420, lib/membase/helper/bucket_helper.py -> I don't see collection parameter being used anywhere.

Line:91, lib/membase/helper/cluster_helper.py -> You can remove this.

Line:1142, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> You can remove this.

Line:1279, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> You can remove this.

Line:1306, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> Same here.

Line:1314, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> Here too.

Line:1360, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> Shouldn't we have something like 
collection = args[1]

or something like that ?

Line:8, lib/memcached/helper/kvstore.py -> There might be some side effects here, @bharath to validate.

Line:90, lib/memcached/helper/kvstore.py -> I don't see collection being used anywhere.

Line:97, lib/memcached/helper/kvstore.py -> Same here as well.

Line:1479, lib/perf_engines/mcsoda.py -> collection not used anywhere.

Line:586, lib/tasks/task.py -> collection not used anywhere.

Line:620, lib/tasks/task.py -> Can we used self.log.info only for consistency ?

Line:737, lib/tasks/task.py -> Can't we use self.collection as you are already initializing in the __init__ ?

Line:751, lib/tasks/task.py -> same as above.

Line:830, lib/tasks/task.py -> Check the same for everywhere.

Line:921, lib/tasks/task.py -> you can remove it.

Line:998, lib/tasks/task.py -> Since you are using self.collection, this param won't be required.

Line:1024, lib/tasks/task.py -> Same as above.

Line:1095, lib/tasks/task.py -> Same as above.

Line:1167, lib/tasks/task.py -> You can remove it.

Line:1474, lib/tasks/task.py -> Same as above.

Line:1599, lib/tasks/task.py -> Since you already have self.bucket and self.collection is this required ?

Line:1681, lib/tasks/task.py -> Same here as well.

Line:2091, lib/tasks/task.py -> Check this everywhere.

Line:216, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Can you remove this?

Line:852, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Is collections supported for memcached bucket ?

Line:946, pytests/basetestcase.py -> you can remove this.

Line:1169, pytests/basetestcase.py -> You can remove these statements used for testing.

Line:2515, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Verification is different even though collection is supported by verify_cluster_stats ? Any particular reason ?

Line:2765, pytests/basetestcase.py -> I think we are better off using _http_request instead of using curl directly. Error handling would be much better. Also very useful when testing in different OS.

Line:2813, pytests/basetestcase.py -> You could use self.log.info for consistency purposes.

Line:23, pytests/epengine/basic_collections.py -> Can we add a .conf file so that these tests are executed some where ? Also might be worthwhile to add 1 test as part of sanity as well.

Line:382, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Why are we removing this ? I think its a merge issue from your local, ashwin had added this in testrunner .
