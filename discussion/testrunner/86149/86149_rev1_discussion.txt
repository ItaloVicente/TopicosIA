(5 comments)

Pls address these review comments
Line:10, conf/tuq/alter_index.conf -> alter_index=True missing in the conf entries

Line:132, pytests/2i/gsi_rebalance_2i.py -> .format has only 1 parameter, while you are trying to substitute 2 tokens in the string - {0} and {1}. This applies to all instances of statement forming alter_index_query in this test

Line:138, pytests/2i/gsi_rebalance_2i.py -> An alternative (and possibly cleaner) approach is to have the switch to use alter index query or the cli inside the self._cbindex_move method, so that the change is only at 1 place.

Line:2033, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> Where is this declared ?

Line:2053, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> Why is this needed ?

Line:10, conf/tuq/alter_index.conf -> corrected.

Line:132, pytests/2i/gsi_rebalance_2i.py -> Checked in this file from an incorrect branch.thanks for pointing this out.I have fixed it in the next checkin.

Line:138, pytests/2i/gsi_rebalance_2i.py -> Since every test has a different expectation of error(comparison of errors in exceptions),I kept the same code in different functions.Right now I cannot think of a cleaner approach which can benefit the exception handling also.

Line:2033, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> I had declared it in QueryHelperTests which didnt get checked in since created this review from a wrong branch.This is fixed in next review.Thanks for pointing it out.

Line:2053, pytests/2i/gsi_replica_indexes.py -> This is part of the test plan, to verify the query is still using the correct index even when index alteration happened in this particular test.

I agree that common code can be moved to cb_move_index but queries using those indexes are different in the tests if you see in gsi_replica_indexes.py.

Also isnt it better to have a different error message for different reasons of failures, if you see some of the tests in gsi_rebalance_2i are searching for different errors during exception handling.Again I agree there is common code which can be moved the cbindex_move method.
