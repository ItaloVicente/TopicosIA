Line:1636, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_base.py -> In the restructuring of this code, I've moved this as best I could to be in line with how this was previously. Though I'm not entirely sure why we do this, because the path resolves to something like: `/tmp/logs/entbackup/logs/C_/tmp/entbackup`, which doesn't make much sense to me.

I don't have a Windows env to test on, so I'm not sure if this works. If this is bad code let me know and I'll remove.
