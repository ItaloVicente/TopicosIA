Patch Set 1:

This is the cloud test suite changes done on cloud branch and merging to master branch.
(NOTE:The goal is to have only required changes to support the cloud platforms without regressing the existing tests. Please review in that context.) 

Verification:
1) AWS run passed with this transaction and see at http://qa.sc.couchbase.com/job/cloudtest-run/71/parameters/

2) The below 2 regular (non cloud) sanity regressions submitted
http://qa.sc.couchbase.com/job/test_suite_dispatcher/37160/
http://qa.sc.couchbase.com/job/test_suite_dispatcher/37161/

Earlier 2 runs passed on the regression runs, so the above should pass. 
Meanwhile, please take a look a the changes.
As folks are checking the fixes, I am seeing frequent merge conflicts are happening. If you can check quickly, then it would help.

Line:138, lib/mc_bin_client.py -> I think we can avoid repeating lines 117-123, by moving them to a finally block or a separate sub.

Line:287, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> This initialization is redundant because of 
self.is_secure = self.input.param("is_secure", False). Better to check if it is a boolean instead.

Line:292, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> redundant initialization

Line:898, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> typo?

Line:50, lib/tasks/task.py -> if ((TestInputSingleton.input.param(testconstants.TESTRUNNER_CLIENT, None) == testconstants.PYTHON_SDK)

Line:104, pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py -> Unnecessary print

Line:122, pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py -> Unnecessary print

Line:2555, pytests/view/viewquerytests.py -> No need for this change

Line:46, pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py -> This change breaks the sanity when the flag is supplied (as in the case of cloud test). Basically, the variable initialization is not happening in such case and eventing_sanity.py (28) should be fixed with similar flag check.
        self.n1ql_helper.run_cbq_query(query=query, server=self.n1ql_node)
        query = "create primary index on {}".format(self.dst_bucket_name)
        self.n1ql_helper.run_cbq_query(query=query, server=self.n1ql_node)
        query = "create primary index on {}".format(self.metadata_bucket_name)
        self.n1ql_helper.run_cbq_query(query=query, server=self.n1ql_node)

Line:5128, pytests/fts/fts_base.py -> FTS tests do not have query/index nodes in the cluster. So this wont work for all tests. Pls remove this.

Line:121, pytests/fts/stable_topology_fts.py -> Pls uncomment this

Line:395, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> Why is this param removed ?

Line:1151, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_gsi_index.py -> Can this logging be removed ?

Line:1177, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_gsi_index.py -> use self.rest (already initialized in setup) instead of opening another connection

Line:1183, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_gsi_index.py -> This could be moved to a common lib, and used elsewhere as well.

Line:573, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_index.py -> Use the same logic as used in http://review.couchbase.org/c/testrunner/+/137296/-1..1/pytests/tuqquery/tuq_gsi_index.py#1185

Line:19, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Small nitpick: The standard library import could go to the top

Line:271, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Is this supposed to be uncommented?

Line:2290, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Is this supposed to be uncommented?

Line:3713, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Small nitpick: This and a few format strings below could be f strings (Assuming this is Python 3)

api = f"{self.baseUrl}pools/default/buckets/{bucket_name}/controller/doFlush"

Line:879, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> Small nitpick: Could do 'mapped_ip, mapped_host = ip_host' 

Assuming ip_host has length exactly equal to 2.

Line:368, pytests/eventing/eventing_helper.py -> Small Nitpick: Could be 'if not list' as non-empty lists evaluate to True.

Line:194, pytests/subdoc/subdoc_base.py -> Small nitpick, could be re-written as.

scheme = "couchbases" if self.secure else "couchbase"

Line:200, pytests/subdoc/subdoc_base.py -> Same as above.

with Tony's changes, we did not see any issues with regression (eventing included) - if it is not working well with cloud options, then that needs to be fixed in this patch - it doesn't justify the option being removed totally

I was asking Tony to check if I set this flag whether the tests work or not. At this time, it doesn’t work because it was partially done. I have sent the jenkins job that got failed with the flag.
1:52
The flag removal is only in this test and need to validate.

okay

Jagadesh Munta  1:52 PM
He can confirm or check what is missing. I may need to try the latest in case he changed in the master.
Arunkumar Senthilnathan  1:52 PM
sounds good
Line:138, lib/mc_bin_client.py -> Ok. Will make it as a function.

Line:40, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> It was added initially for is_admin check. Will remove.

Line:271, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Will convert as log.debug().

Line:287, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> This is to have is_secure=False set even when the self.input is not available. I have added this when I saw failed during install scripts runtime.

Line:292, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Kept it to make it symmetric w.r.t secured one. Will remove this line (reducing 1 stmt during execution).

Line:1066, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> This was kept to understand if any requests get stuck during the regression due to mismatch of protocol (http/https), port (unsecured/secured) and host (public/private). Saw many times this issue during the runtime because here these 3 request parts are getting changed. Otherwise, we need to traceout or debug again if this is indeed the case or not. Anyways, will convert to log.debug().

Line:2290, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Will convert as log.debug().

Line:898, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> Yes. It was a typo:-( will fix.

Line:88, lib/sdk_client.py -> Commented code to show the connect string example. Will remove.

Line:97, lib/sdk_client.py -> Yes. Will remove.

Line:50, lib/tasks/task.py -> Little different. Not setting the None as default if the input is not given and instead to use default as testconstants.TESTRUNNER_CLIENT as we want to use the testrunner client to use sdk by default.

Line:46, pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py -> Tony, please take a look at this and for now, this change is needed to make it work.

Line:104, pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py -> The code was not debuggable as when tests were failing. Will convert to log.debug()

Line:122, pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py -> The code was not debuggable as when tests were failing. Will convert to log.debug()

Line:5128, pytests/fts/fts_base.py -> Ok. Will remove. Better to have an alternative logic to find the result.Currently, it can keep waiting.

Line:121, pytests/fts/stable_topology_fts.py -> Ok. In fact, I thought I have added this.

Line:395, pytests/tuqquery/tuq.py -> Will be put it back. It is interesting. In fact, I don't think I have deleted in purpose but mostly editor might have done some optimization and I might have not noticed.

Line:1151, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_gsi_index.py -> Ok.

Line:1177, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_gsi_index.py -> Ok. Will move along the below code.

Line:1183, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_gsi_index.py -> Ok. will move to rest_client as same place as get_nodes_versions().

Line:573, pytests/tuqquery/tuq_index.py -> Ok

Line:2555, pytests/view/viewquerytests.py -> It was done initially for debugging the doc (printing the doc) generation and later removed those comments. will put it back.

Line:76, lib/sdk_client.py -> I think I have verified this using & as working than ",". See the sample connect strings with "&" than ",". https://docs.couchbase.com/c-sdk/2.10/sdk-authentication-overview.html
https://github.com/couchbaselabs/devguide-examples/blob/master/c/connecting-cert-auth.c
Need to test again. Can Ritam confirm?
