Line:170, lib/couchbase_helper/cluster.py -> Please remove this extra print.

Line:20, lib/mc_bin_client.py -> Can input be taken from base test case and be passed on as a parameter to memcached client ?

Line:5274, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> get app logs is used in other places in testrunner. need to add it back.

Line:11, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> 1. Test Input to be taken in basetestcase
2. Unnecessary log statements.
3. There is http_protocol - an is_secure - both of them indicate that connection mechanism is SSL ?

Line:263, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> You can ignore my comments on rest_port coming from ini file.

Line:282, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Please remove the unnecessary log statements.

Line:1097, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> This is again not needed.

Line:1531, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Sometime in ini file we don't pass the port for ns_server, and assume it to be default to 8091. Would there be a change in ini files ?

Line:2869, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> convert this to log

Line:2873, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> This might fail, since we wait for bucket deletion to happen and retry.  You may want to check if the bucket still exists before deletion.

Line:107, lib/sdk_client.py -> cbadminbucket is specific user created in test to not test via Administrator or rest_username. Need to add cbadminbucket

Line:326, lib/sdk_client.py -> 1. all cas, ttl and durability settings needs to be intact
2. keep the sleep back. A lot of logic in docloaders will need to change if tmp failure occurs. And Temp failures is just of the failures that you can see while insert. I would like to keep the original one as it is.

Line:113, pytests/cbas/cbas_base.py -> Missing the assignment ?

Line:18, pytests/subdoc/subdoc_nested_dataset.py -> Will have to run a subdoc tests to check for this have. I would keep it as it is, since the data generation is different for subdoc tests.

Line:170, lib/couchbase_helper/cluster.py -> Ok

Line:20, lib/mc_bin_client.py -> Will discuss more in our Tonight's meeting.

Line:5274, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Thanks for the catch. Will add. Not sure how this function is gone! It might be that merge issue.

Line:11, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Will discuss more on the input part. On the SSL side, is_secure is the indication for SSL. Initially, I had started with http_protocol alone but later realized this is not sufficient for other like couchbases protocol.

Line:282, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Ok. This is in debug mode and it helped while running the tests as sometimes simply hangs when private ip is being used during cloud testing.

Line:1097, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Ok. This was done to find if any init cluster is attempted during tests runtime.

Line:2869, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> Ok

Line:2873, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> If no bucket, then api would return 404 resource not found and delete_bucket function should come-out immediately. So far no issue but might need to check this function with a sample test;)

Line:107, lib/sdk_client.py -> This can be done in the test itself but not in the generic function. Let us discuss more in Tonight's meeting.

Line:326, lib/sdk_client.py -> Oh ok. I don't remember now the trigger for this change (this might have caused an issue for some of the cloud sanity tests).
Will discuss more and put it back.

Line:113, pytests/cbas/cbas_base.py -> Yes:-( Good catch.

Line:18, pytests/subdoc/subdoc_nested_dataset.py -> Ok. Will trigger subdoc sanity.
