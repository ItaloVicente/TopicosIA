Patch Set 35: -Code-Review

(4 comments)

Jagadesh, there are few comments, can you please review those and I will review next set.
Line:16, lib/couchbase_helper/cluster.py -> self.flags contain keys which match the other class variables. Cn we just self.flags only.

Line:7, lib/couchbase_helper/stats_tools.py -> Duplicate use of self.flags.

Line:22, lib/couchbase_helper/tuq_helper.py -> Please have just one, either is_flag or class variable.

Line:13, lib/membase/api/rest_client.py -> nodes/self - I am not sure what is need for this code. You will need to read cluster setting permission to read either of the 2  rest api.

Thanks for comments, Ritam.
 Why don't you finish the remaining and we can have a discussion to better understand the requested changes? 
I have used some techniques to minimize the function parameters with **self.flags while keeping the individual params to the functions as requested. 
My request is to better to have a conversation ( to avoid back and forth) once you finish your review.
