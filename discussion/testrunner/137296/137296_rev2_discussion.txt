Patch Set 2:

Hi, Does anyone know how to find the current merge conflicts from gerrit? When I did git rebase master, then it doesn't have any effect. I have updated PS2 based on the feedback and would like to do the see the merge conflicts with PS2 (or even PS1). For some reason (may be due to branch merge + changes on top), earlier used to get the conflicts when we do the checkout from gerrit checkout is not coming now.
Please share if you have any clues.

1. git checkout master
2. git pull

// Click on downloads and copy the 'Checkout' option 
3. git fetch "http://review.couchbase.org/testrunner" refs/changes/96/137296/2 && git checkout FETCH_HEAD
4. git rebase origin/master

If you use git status, you will see that the conflict is in pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py

After the conflict is resolved, you need to add 'pytests/eventing/eventing_base.py' and do a git --amend.

You should be able to push at this point.

Thanks. #4 after #3 is the key. 
(Earlier, I was expecting to get the list of conflicts at step#3. Or I was doing #4 on the existing workspace where I did the PS2.)

About the conflict on this eventing_base.py (and eventing_sanity.py test failed issue), I had a short discussion with Tony. Tony is going to add the flag check in the eventing_sanity.py where the variables are being expected but not available. He will also try with skip_init_check_cbserver=True (default is False and I am setting skip_init_check_cbserver=True) for regression check on these eventing tests.
