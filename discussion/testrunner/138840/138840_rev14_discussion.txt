DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6037: Improved cleanup

Recover from situations where nodes have been removed from a cluster
during a backup service test case to ensure we're always running tests
against a multi cluster node.

Recover from situations where nodes have been failed over. In this case
we can set their recovery type, do an add back followed by a rebalance.

Line:358, pytests/basetestcase.py -> The 'try except' catches the 'ServerAlreadyJoinedException' which is thrown when you attempt to add a node which has already been added.

The logic has been changed to add the nodes which are not part of the cluster so we no longer need to catch that exception.

This snippet of code is wrapped up inside an input param (on line 335). If the param 'backup_service_test' is not set, this code is ignored and not executed.

This area of code required because it assembles all the nodes into a cluster before any data put into the buckets which speeds up test cases. Some test cases may cause nodes to failover. The logic in this block recovers from that situation. If the nodes are already assembled into a cluster, we don't need to do anything. So if we couple this with skipping a complete tear down between individual test runs, we can speed up tests as opposed to assembling into a cluster between each test run.
