DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6037: Improved cleanup

Recover from situations where nodes have been removed from a cluster
during a backup service test case to ensure we're always running tests
against a multi cluster node.

Recover from situations where nodes have been failed over. In this case
we can set their recovery type, do an add back followed by a rebalance.
