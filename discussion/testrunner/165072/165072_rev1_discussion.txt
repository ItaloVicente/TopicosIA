DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-7208: 17/n Migrate some class variables to object variables

These variables(which are being migrated) have their values which
get changed in every test. Hence they aren't really constant across
tests. It can lead to failures if these values are not reset to
defaults at the start of a new test. They should be moved to init
so that they get destroyed after their usage.
