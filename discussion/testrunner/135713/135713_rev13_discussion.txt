DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6049: Refactored previous 7 tests and add 2 new backup plan tests.

To make the code easier to read, I refactored the previous 7 backup plan
tests to use http error codes as opposed to testing if ApiExceptions are
thrown / not thrown.

Added the following tests:

1. Users can not create plans with the same name.
2. Once a plan with name A is deleted name A can be reused.

Added a conf file to capture the backup service tests.
