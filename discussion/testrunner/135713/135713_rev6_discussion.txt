DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6049: Refactored previous 7 tests and add 2 new backup plan tests.

To make the code easier to read, I refactored the previous 7 backup plan
tests to use http error codes as opposed to testing if ApiExceptions are
thrown / not thrown.

Added the following tests:

1. Users can not create plans with the same name.
2. Once a plan with name A is deleted name A can be reused.

Added a conf file to capture the backup service tests.

Line:9, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_base.py -> (Nitpicky) Standard lib imports should go first

Line:49, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> I dont think that the plan POST endpoint should ever return 404

Line:274, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> I think you have a spare "a"

Line:49, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> When the repo name is empty you get a non existent end-point and consequently a 404, it's kind of a superfluous case. But perhaps there is some merit to testing what happens if you don't complete the repo name for that end-point. I can remove it if you like.
