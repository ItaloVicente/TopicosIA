DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6049: Refactored previous 7 tests and add 2 new backup plan tests.

To make the code easier to read, I refactored the previous 7 backup plan
tests to use http error codes as opposed to testing if ApiExceptions are
thrown / not thrown.

Added the following tests:

1. Users can not create plans with the same name.
2. Once a plan with name A is deleted name A can be reused.

Added a conf file to capture the backup service tests.

Line:1, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_base.py -> NITPICKING: Modules should be grouped followed by a newline.

Line:54, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> I believe there is an assertIn function which would make this cleaner

Line:54, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> Should we be expecting a 404 here, we're not for the other test cases (I don't know, just a question)?

Line:54, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> /endpoint/to/insert/a/repo/{repo_name}

When the repo name is empty you get a non existent end-point and consequently a 404, it's a superfluous case.

I've extracted that case out into its own little assert statement to make that more clear.

Line:54, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> Changed to an assertEqual with a comparison to a 400 status code.

Extracted the 404 case out (as explained below).
