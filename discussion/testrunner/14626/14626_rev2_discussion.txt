this looks good but please don't merge it because this will break existing xdcr test cases.

can you merge this to branch-18 of test runner instead ?

(4 inline comments)

See my comments as minor nitpicks about general Python style. This shouldn't be seen as a blocker.
Line:846, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> I"m not sure if those get_{valid|deleted|expired|]_key() methods are needed. I would just rename the `get_key_check_status()` to `get_status()` (or just `status`).

Line:952, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> Python doesn't need braces for an if statement. It's the same for the next two `elif` and the two functions below.

Line:1013, lib/memcached/helper/data_helper.py -> The class is called `KVClient*Task*Manager`, I wouldn't repeat *task* in every method call. Hence I would just name name them, `create()`, `start()`, `pause()`, `resume()`, `complete()`, `abort()`, `verify()`, `verify_all()` and `complete_all()`.

Line:120, pytests/rebalancingtests.py -> I would define `self.master` and `'self.rest' here, as it is needed so often.
