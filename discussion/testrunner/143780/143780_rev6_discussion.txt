Line:48, lib/backup_service_client/models/transfer.py -> Major Nitpicking: It might be nice to have a comment/documentation around this since it's pretty hard to determine what we're matching at a glance. I imagine this is matches backup directories which use a modified RFC3339Nano format (with the colons changed for underscores). It might be worth mentioning this, and maybe have a small example.

For reference, we've started doing this for larger/more complicated regular expressions in the 'backup' repository:
https://github.com/couchbase/backup/blob/f67fa37cc9523081f49cf37e45716a4038a1f72d/value/connection_string.go#L75
https://github.com/couchbase/backup/blob/f67fa37cc9523081f49cf37e45716a4038a1f72d/value/connection_string.go#L82

A group breakdown would be overkill for this Regex though since we don't care about the groups.
