DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6460: Fix the ipv6 issues when resetting a cluster.

What's the problem:

The IPv6 tests are failing because the address family resets to IPv4
after deleting a subset of the folders while leaving the cluster
configured with an IPv6 address. Consequently, Ns_server refuses to
start because it has IPv6 address but the address family is set to IPv4.

What's the fix:

1. Delete all the files in opt/couchbase/var/lib/couchbase.
2. Omit code which updates the dist_cfg.
3. Use the well documented couchbase-cli's node-init sub command to set
   the address family to IPv6.
