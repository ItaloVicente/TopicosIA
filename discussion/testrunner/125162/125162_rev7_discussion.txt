Hi Bharath, Thanks for taking care of this. Added few minor comments. Please see if you can take care now or next iteration.
Line:17, scripts/find_rerun_job.py -> Bharath, Could you please parameterize this host value instead of hard coded host IP alone?

Line:108, scripts/find_rerun_job.py -> Bharath, Could you please parameterize these user/pwd values (with above default values) instead of hard coded values.?

Line:45, scripts/get_jenkins_params.py -> Bharath, Could you please take this value as TIMEOUT=15 as global and use it across (I see at couple of places)?
