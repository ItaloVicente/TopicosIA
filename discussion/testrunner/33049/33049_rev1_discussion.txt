DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-1913: refactor failovertests

* Moved calls to rest/ssh into appropriate tasks sometimes borrowing from
implementation in basetestcase.

* Removed common method being used by all the tests with all its conditions
and mad each of the tests flatter having their own consice flow

* Added a swap orchestrator failover test

* I tried port/password tests - more debugging needed, they may be long somewhere else
but I'm leaving in case someone wants to implement

* The addback test needs to make use of its own addbacktask as full rebalance cannot be used in this case
