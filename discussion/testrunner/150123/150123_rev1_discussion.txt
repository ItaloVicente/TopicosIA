DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6723: Fix timeout checking for backup service tests

Currently come backup service tests are failing due to timeouts not
being handled properly, either through giving a limit that's far too
small, or not checking on the progress properly.

Line:815, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> I would note that self.wait_for_task is the better function to use in comparison to  self.wait_for_backup_task which is a legacy function.

It's better if everything moves to self.wait_for_task as it uses polling as to avoid sleeping for long periods of time. It logs more detailed information about tasks that failed as well which self.wait_for_backup_task does not do. ( / self.wait_for_backup_task should be removed from the code base completely)

You will lose those improvements if you go back to the old function self.wait_for_backup_task consequently making it harder to determine why something failed.

self.wait_for_task does take a timeout param which can be set to 400 for example.

Line:862, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> Same as above.

Line:1760, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> I think it's better to remove than comment it out. We can rely on version control to remember and retrieve if it's needed in the future.

Line:815, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> Cheers, have changed this to use wait_for_task with a higher timeout as suggested
