Line:752, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> the difference between positive and negative cases is only two numbers - one in start key and another one- expected keys. can we just create a dictionary for example with expected keys and start keys and then just iterate key-value pairs? e.g start_keys = { num_items : [929342299234203, 13403751757202], 0 : [929342299234203, 13403751757602]}
And we will have only one common method

Line:752, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> But that's what you earlier suggested to break into multiple tests? I can create another common method just like setup to have the rest of the common code, if that's what you are suggesting?

Line:752, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> I am talking about test methods, not about setup
I think we can have only one method:
def test_view_big_int_positive(self):
	
    num_items = 10
    self._big_int_test_setup(num_items)

    start_keys = { num_items : [929342299234203, 13403751757202], 0 : [929342299234203, 13403751757602]}
    end_keys = [ [929342299234203, 13990000000000], [929342299234203, 13900000000000] ]

    for expected_items, start_key in start_keys.iteritems():
	    for key in end_keys:
		query = {"startkey" : start_key,
		         "endkey" : key,
		         "stale" : "false", "connection_timeout" : 60000}

		result = self.cluster.query_view(self.master, 'ddoc_big_int', 'view_big_int', query, expected_items)
		if not result:
		    self.fail("View query for big int didn't return expected result")
		self.log.info("View query for big int Successful")

Line:752, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> I think we originally set out to create separate test methods rather than 1 :) With two test methods right now, I have separated positive/negative cases so its easy to identify from logs which one has failed. I can merge these into 1 method as its a trivial change. Let me know.

Line:752, pytests/view/createdeleteview.py -> I suppose that we should merge it in one test. Because actually negative test is a test designed to determine the response of the system outside of what is defined. It is designed to determine if the system fails with unexpected input. And here to my mind we don't fail anything we expect 0 rows. That a sort of critical path positive bounds test. But may be i am wrong, so approving it
