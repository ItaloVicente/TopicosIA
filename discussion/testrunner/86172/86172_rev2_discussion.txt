DESCRIPTION:

Revert "CBQE-4378 Change latestbuilds ip to fqdn so builds can be wget from ipv6-only servers"

This reverts commit 558a621091da73868f414d13249b2ea6db84613f.

Reverting as this change is causing failures in installation on hosts that cannot access nas.build.couchbase.com. Pls work with IT as mentioned on hipchat to resolve the issue with DNS.

One of the jobs that failed during installation - http://qa.sc.couchbase.com/job/test_suite_executor/36070/console

172.23.106.209 and 172.23.106.221 cannot wget the builds from the nas.build.couchbase.com locations.
