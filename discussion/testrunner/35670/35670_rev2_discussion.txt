please divide on 2 commits: CBQE-2182, CBQE-2138
didn't find where we are going to get logs before cleanup( according to CBQE-2138)
Line:1980, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> command += is easier

Line:26, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> remove

Line:129, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> what is the purpose of adding new tear_Down? we already have some teardowns in this module.

Line:170, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> log file will be "None/..." by default

Line:174, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> as I understand, all_docs functionality will be removed in the near future?

Line:47, scripts/collect_data_files.py -> data path folder for many runs/jobs is not default. + doesn't work for windows and mac.

Line:1980, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> Done

Line:26, pytests/xdcr/uniXDCR.py -> Done

Line:129, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> In line:450, we were calling tearDown() function before (motive was to called cleanup code here). So I just created a new function to call at line:450 and created new tearDown() function with additional steps e.g. dump_all_docs, collect_data_files, clean_up clusters etc.

Line:170, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> Done

Line:174, pytests/xdcr/xdcrbasetests.py -> We will commented out this code then, currently it is needed by dev/QE to debug some issues.

Line:47, scripts/collect_data_files.py -> Done

I have changed the summary for CBQE-2138. "Collect data files before cleanup", because of collecting all logs before tearDown() has its own complication of moving code and required lot of effort. And not required at this point.
