DESCRIPTION:

Optimise base setup and teardown

Optimised base setup and teardown to reduce
redundant code and run the tests faster.
1. Removed multiple cluster resets in tests.
Now the tests will reset the cluster only once,
at the teardown step. Only for first test in
the suite, the setup will be done twice due to
the teardown being called in setup of the test.
2. Removed redundant old legacy code i.e
memcached buckets, sasl buckets and TAP
protocol checks.
3. Removed some dead and obsolete code.

Line:715, testrunner.py -> Could we replace line #576 with #714? Multiple initialization of base_tear_down_run and last_case_fail(#751) is confusing

Line:450, pytests/basetestcase.py -> Instead of switching "teardown_run" to True/False multiple times, maybe set it to False by default, and make it True as needed (since True is set fewer times).

Line:643, testrunner.py -> Is there a reason for converting boolean to string?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:450, pytests/basetestcase.py -> So the way teardown_run is used is to figure out if the previous test had run the teardown or not. So if the last test had failed and teardown wasn't run ,we will run the teardown to bring the nodes to good state again. If the teardown was run, then we don't need to run teardown again. So setting teardown_run to True/false by default will reset the value set in the last test. This is the reason I had to set/reset it a few times in the code.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:643, testrunner.py -> This was done to keep parity of the data type in the dictionary. The test_params is of type {str, str}. While python doesn't care if there is mismatch, it's good to have parity I felt.
