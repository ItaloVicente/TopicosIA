First set fo comments. Thank You.  It been a long time I have seen test.xml file, will run individually and with test suite.
Line:60, testrunner.py -> File needs to be an input along with pass and fail. Ultimately you will have to read the results file to match passed and failed.

Line:155, testrunner.py -> This entire code can be optimised.

Line:310, testrunner.py -> This code can again be optimised, is duplicated below.

Line:702, testrunner.py -> Need to check if this can be done with an inbuilt function.

Line:60, testrunner.py -> Yes. It is covered. Please see #4 in the below covered cases.

Overall includetests option covered use cases:

1) -d <regularexpression>
2) -d file=<conf-file>
3) -d failed or -d passed : in this case automatically checks all the results xml files in the logs folder.
4) -d failed=<reportfile.xml> or -d passed=<reportfile.xml> : in this case, only from the given result/report  xml file.

Line:155, testrunner.py -> Yeah. Duplicate code can be reduced. In the next iteration, I can take care. In fact, I had that in mind but switched to other activities;)

Line:310, testrunner.py -> Yeah. Duplicate code can be reduced. In the next iteration, I can take care. In fact, I had that in mind but switched to other activities;)

Line:702, testrunner.py -> At that time, I had quickly searched but not found so went ahead with above. Yes. We can switch as we know the functionality.

After using the 2 patches, I have some concerns with the way new parameters are designed. I found it a bit too confusing with all the ways parameters can be given. I feel a separating the parameters might solve some confusion even if adds to the number of options while running the testrunner. And it will also make the implementation of the new operations better I feel. As of now, there are too many if conditions and the options (passed, failed, file etc) are hard coded to the logic, which should not be the case.
Line:60, testrunner.py -> This should be include_tests or include-tests. That is the posix/GNU standards that generally followed. This applies to all the new parameters added. Refer http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#Option-Table or https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap12.html

Line:62, testrunner.py -> This makes it very confusing to me atleast. The parameters are doing great many different operations based on the input to the argument. And the operations are quite different in that aspect too. It would be easier to understand and use if we have separate options for each operation. For example, we can have options "include_tests', "failed_tests", "passed_tests" etc. to make it more usable and readable. These can be boolean options. And programatically we can even group the options to make it easier to run and implement the various operations.

Thanks for the feedback.
In general, I would request to focus more on must fixes (fail-fast mode) for the checkin so that we can get some maturity and fix issues if any quickly -- so functionality/use case. So I think let us do 1) must have changes 2) nice to have that can go next based on time. It all depends on how much time to spend and cost associated with these changes.
Based on the above, please give the score so that we can move on.
Line:60, testrunner.py -> Ok. We can change the long option name to include_tests.

Line:62, testrunner.py -> In fact, I disagree but let us discuss more in our meeting.
I have tried to simplify and optimize and contained all include part in -d and exclude part in -e options. If you separate, it would add more complexity to handle the dependencies (option1 -- option2 -- option3) among multiple options. Just give what is to be included, then it should work. About some if conditions, I don't think many. Even if you add more options, then also you can't eliminate if conditions.
In the current case, all you need do is have a jenkins job with one include_tests and user can update with any of these supported values instead of dynamically adding new options or too many options.
If any few cases need to be separated, we can think about real value and change it. It is simple to play with these options. 

Again, we can have the user experience check while it is in progress and modify accordingly.

In general, I would request to focus more on must fixes (fail-fast mode) for the checkin so that we can get some maturity and fix issues if any quickly -- so  functionality/use case.  So  I think let us do 1) must have changes 2) nice to have that can go next based on time. It all depends on how much time to spend and cost associated with these changes.

I will explain more during in our automation meeting.
