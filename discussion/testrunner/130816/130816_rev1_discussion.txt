Line:43, pytests/ent_backup_restore/validation_helpers/backup_restore_validations.py -> curious if it would be better to check if it created the expected files instead of the exact number as it is very likely that in the near future we increate or decrease the number of files made for example there is suggestion https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-38344 that would likely increase it.

Line:43, pytests/ent_backup_restore/validation_helpers/backup_restore_validations.py -> This was something I was thinking about too because this testing is really fragile anyway... but this is the way it's done (for local backups) below so If we do add additional files in the future this validation will have to be modified in any case. I am happy to modify this though if you think it's needed.

Line:43, pytests/ent_backup_restore/validation_helpers/backup_restore_validations.py -> If we do it like that today then it will be fine.
