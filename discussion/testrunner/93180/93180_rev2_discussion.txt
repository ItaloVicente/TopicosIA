DESCRIPTION:

High throughput doc loader.
1. A simple loader that loads docs into couchbase server with high throughput
2. The script takes following parameters:
  --threads : Number of threads to run (int)
  --batch_size : Batch size of eatch inserts (int)
  --node : Cluster Node to connect to (defaults to localhost)
  --bucket : Bucket to connect to (defaults to default)
  --password : User password (defaults to password)
  --user : Username (defaults to Administrator)
  --count : Number of documents to insert (int)
  --start_document : Starting document to start loading from. (int)
3. Single instance generally gives around 20K ops/sec depending on the batch and thread count. To get higher ops, start multiple instances of the script
ex: python scripts/high_ops_doc_loader.py  --node 172.23.106.143 --bucket default --user Administrator --password password --count 1000000 --batch_size 1000 --threads 10 --start_document 0 & python scripts/high_ops_doc_loader.py  --node 172.23.106.143 --bucket default --user Administrator --password password --count 1000000 --batch_size 1000 --threads 10 --start_document 1000000
4. The script currently does only creates. Updates of documents is currently under test.
5. The code isn't very efficient or pretty. The immediate objective was to have a doc loader that deterministically tells us if there was data loss due to rebalance and run the load at high throughput even during rebalance.

Further commits will have updates of documents and better code.

Hi, this looks OK, and gets reasonable throughput on ManCouch, but the standard synchronous benchmark using multiple threads does a lot better:

Note that this compares favourably to the ~180kops/sec we got with Pillowfight :)

Was that with the same threads / batch size as bench.py; or with it's own defaults (threads=5, batch_size=5000) ?

I can't remember now, but just playing with the settings now and using different batch sizes 50-5000 (with threads=5), I can't get past 30K or so:
