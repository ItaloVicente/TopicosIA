DESCRIPTION:

High throughput doc loader.
1. A simple loader that loads/updates/validates docs into/from couchbase server with high throughput
2. The script takes following parameters:
    --node Cluster Node to connect to
    --bucket Bucket to connect to
    --password User password
    --user Username
    --prefix Key Prefix
    --timeout Operation Timeout (int)
    --count Number of documents in the bucket already (int)
    --ops Number of mutations to perform (int)
    --start_document Starting document count to start updating from (int)
    --update_counter Starting update counter to start updating from (int)
    --cb_version Current version of the couchbase cluster
    --size Size of the document to be inserted, in bytes (int)
    --updates Run updates instead of creates (bool)
    --validate Validate the documents (bool)
    --updated Was update performed on documents before validation (bool)
    --threads Number of threads to run (int)
    --batch_size Batch size of eatch inserts (int)
    --replicate_to Perform durability checking on this many replicas for presence in memory
    --instances Create multiple instances of the generator for higher throughput
    --ttl Set expiry timer for documents
3. For a single instance of the script, only one of the operations (creates, updates or validates) can be performed.
4. Single instance generally gives around 20K ops/sec depending on the batch and thread count. To get higher ops, start multiple instances of the script
ex: python scripts/high_ops_doc_loader.py  --node 172.23.106.143 --bucket default --user Administrator --password password --count 1000000 --batch_size 1000 --threads 10 --start_document 0 & python scripts/high_ops_doc_loader.py  --node 172.23.106.143 --bucket default --user Administrator --password password --count 1000000 --batch_size 1000 --threads 10 --start_document 1000000

ex:
For creates: python high_ops_doc_gen.py --node 172.23.105.212 --user Administrator --password password --threads 10 --batch_size 200 --count 100000 --start_document 0 --instances 10
For updates: python high_ops_doc_gen.py --node 172.23.105.212 --user Administrator --password password --threads 10 --batch_size 200 --count 100000 --start_document 0 --ops 300000 --updates --instances 10
For Validates: python high_ops_doc_gen.py --node 172.23.105.212 --user Administrator --password password --threads 10 --batch_size 2000 --count 100000 --start_document 0 --ops 300000 --validate --updated --instances 10

Latest patch contains following changes:
1. Included instances parameter to create multiple instances of the generator (Using python multiprocess lib)
2. Optimized the code slightly to get better throughput than previous patch
3. Using separate couchbase connections for each threads
4. Added support to validate replicas (both during upserts and validation phase)
5. Added ttl support

Line:54, scripts/high_ops_doc_gen.py -> int(args.count * ops_to_items_ratio)

Line:116, scripts/high_ops_doc_gen.py -> int(self.ops_to_items_ratio)

Line:119, scripts/high_ops_doc_gen.py -> int(self.ops_to_items_ratio * self.num_items)

Line:162, scripts/high_ops_doc_gen.py -> Earlier, in setup

 self.ops_to_items_ratio = int(self.num_of_ops) / int(self.num_items) #constant
        
None of these member variables are written to again.
self.num_items = int(args.count)
self.num_of_ops = int(args.ops)
(self.ops_to_items_ratio * self.num_items)==
(int(self.num_of_ops) / int(self.num_items) * int(self.num_items))==
(int(self.num_of_ops))

This statement seems therefore to be equivalent to:

if (self.num_of_ops - self.num_of_ops) >0:

or

if True:

Also, there are numerous places where
(self.ops_to_items_ratio * self.num_items) is used instead of self.num_of_ops

This isn't necessarily a logic error, but rather confusing.

at least?

Bharath there has to be logs from data loader of what got inserted and what got updated/deleted. A verbose option will be good enough.

Patch Set 5:

Note - want to add to Ritam's comment about having the data loading and validating in the same thread.

We want the tool to be in general bounded in terms of data size, because we want to be able to run it constantly for an extended period of time if necessary. An easy / obvious way to do this is to iterate over the same set of keys in "passes". Note that just because we do this doesn't mean we have to do only updates. As the tool's capabilities grow we can mix in a certain percentage of creates and an equal percentage of deletes so that data remains constant. At any rate, in most scenarios we will find ourselves iterating over keys and doing creates / updates / deletes in a number of passes.

It's the case that the mutations we generate should always be deterministic. Which is to say that for a given key and a given pass we can easily figure out the mutation. This makes validation easy.

We want to be able to pass this logic to the validation layer in some potentially involved way. Perhaps for instance the data generation thread runs to the end of a pass and the data validation thread is concurrently validating and rendezvous's with the generation thread at the end of the pass before proceeding to the next pass. Perhaps we do something simpler like generate 500 mutations, then validate those mutations before resuming.

Doing this kind of coordination across threads is complicated and is better done in the same process.
