DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6243: Test the backup service max scopes/collections

Test the backup service can restore the maximum number of collections.

Creating a large number collections and attempting to flush the bucket
via the doFlush endpoint returns an internal error. To avoid this, we
can restore to a different cluster informing the backup service to auto
create the bucket.

In the case of a single document being inserted into each collection,
it's possible to have all documents end up in a single vbucket. To avoid
this, we can prepend the collection id to each document key.
