Patch Set 1:

If I was reviewing this I'd definitely mention that this should be done in the patch where this was originally introduced (which hasn't been merged yet) but since I'm working on a fairly large relation chain now, I'm hoping we can let it slide for now with the interest on just getting this stuff in and running.
