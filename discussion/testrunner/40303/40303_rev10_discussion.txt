Line:85, pytests/xdcr/biXDCR.py -> This change will ignore a case where memcached returns "not_found" even before it is deleted on either sides. As I had explained on Skype, ignoring err_not_found should be applicable only to second delete and since it is not predictable which thread will delete first, locked delete is the correct way to deal with this problem. 

This change will still work but will not cover the scenario mentioned above.
