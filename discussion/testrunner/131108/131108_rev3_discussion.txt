DESCRIPTION:

[13/n] Run all existing rbac restore tests against object store

Requires a new archive directory to be created and uploaded into the QE
bucket which is called 'entbackup_6.6.0.tar.gz'. This archive should be
identical to the one that currently resides in 'entbackup_mh.tgz'
however should use the Rift storage format instead of SQLite.
