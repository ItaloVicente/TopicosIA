DESCRIPTION:

made changes testrunner to use unittest.TextTestRunner

made changes testrunner to use unittest.TextTestRunner

removed the support for running the tests using /run method for
tests under tests folder.
this was introducing overhead during test developement and exeuction
because for every test case under pytests/.../py we need to create
a folder under tests with a run method which simply calls into
TextTestRunner(pyunit) runner
