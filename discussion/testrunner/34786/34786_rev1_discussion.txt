Changed the code as since we had failures in windows enviroment
- A machine which was stopped did not run on restart since we would restart membase than couchbase server
- The setup was taking an hour long time to setup since we were running rebalance with buckets during setup than add nodes, rebalanace, add data
- The remote util code was taking care of cases where windows were running on 3.0

Line:228, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> please remove if condition at all. it's the same as: if not f_version.start with("1.7") and not f_version.start with("1.6"):

But we don't use/support tests with 1.6&1.7 builds.

Line:2270, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> Sorry, did not understand that this parameter means. if false:
we call shell.start_couchbase(). if True: we call shell.start_couchbase()? and if only startAll=False we shell.disable_firewall()?


common_basic_setup is used only in auto/failover tests that support only couchbase. we should get rid of references membase here.

Line:2293, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> please remove if condition at all. it's the same as: if not f_version.start with("1.7") and not f_version.start with("1.6"):

But we don't use/support tests with 1.6&1.7 builds.

Line:292, pytests/autofailovertests.py -> started but not stopped?

Line:350, pytests/autofailovertests.py -> nodes never used
