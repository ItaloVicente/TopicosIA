Patch Set 5: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I would ideally want to change the extrct_remote_info methid..

right now it goes over ssh, I want it to go over rest... 

self/nodes gives the os_type.

Karan, I agree that getting this information is a bad idea via ssh, especially when it is invoked frequently for no apparent reason. I tried not to call it without a special reason, when investigated autofailover tests(http://qa.hq.northscale.net/job/centos-64-2.0-failover-tests/329/console). Here this method is called one by one and see what happens very difficult. I agree that the best way to get it through the rest, but this is not always possible, for example prior to installation. what is you offer now? Can we get rid of it at least for the methods start_couchbase and stop_souchbase? 

the other option is to modify the tests to not use so many extract_remote_info

with a slow connection it does require a lot of time :)
Line:563, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> the same info is obtained twice

Line:635, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> the same info is obtained twice
