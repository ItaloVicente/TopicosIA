DESCRIPTION:

High throughput doc loader.

1. A simple loader that loads/updates/validates docs into/from couchbase server with high throughput
2. The script takes following parameters:
  --help                Print help section
  --spec SPEC, -U SPEC  Cluster connections string. [Default=couchbase://localhost]
  --bucket BUCKET, -b BUCKET
                        Bucket to connect to
  --password PASSWORD, -p PASSWORD
                        User password
  --user USER, -u USER  Username
  --batch_size BATCH_SIZE, -B BATCH_SIZE
                        Batch size of eatch inserts
  --prefix PREFIX, -k PREFIX
                        Key Prefix
  --timeout TIMEOUT, -t TIMEOUT
                        KV Operation Timeout
  --count COUNT, -c COUNT
                        Number of documents in the bucket already
  --start_document START_DOCUMENT
                        Starting document count to start updating from
  --passes PASSES, -P PASSES
                        Number of mutation cycles to perform per document (including create)
  --update_counter UPDATE_COUNTER
                        Starting update counter to start updating from
  --cb_version CB_VERSION
                        Current version of the couchbase cluster
  --size SIZE           Size of the document to be inserted, in bytes
  --validation VALIDATION, -v VALIDATION
                        Validate the documents. 0=No validation, 1=Validate at end, 2=Validate after each pass, 3=Perform only validation and no mutation. [Default=0]
  --replicate_to REPLICATE_TO
                        Perform durability checking on this many replicas for presence in memory
  --ttl TTL             Set expiry timer for documents
  --delete              Delete documents from bucket
  --num_delete NUM_DELETE
                        Number of documents to delete
  --deleted             Was delete of documents run before validation
  --deleted_items DELETED_ITEMS
                        Number of documents that were deleted
  --validate_expired    Validate if documents have expired
  --rate_limit RATE_LIMIT, -r RATE_LIMIT
                        Set operations per second limit

3. The tool can create documents and update them based on the count parameter.
4. For pure creates, give passes=1. For both create and updates, give passes=(num of mutations required + 1).
5. For pure updates, include update_counter = (value of update in document + 1).
6. For deletes, include delete and num_delete parameters.
7. The tool can also validate the data loaded. Include validation parameter for validation.
8. For no validation, give validation=0
   For validation at the end of the load generation, give validation=1
   For validation after each pass of mutation, give validation=2
   For only validation and no mutations, give validation=3
   With validation=3, pass -update_counter=value of update in a document (and --deleted and --deleted_items=docs_deleted)
9. The rate of mutations can be limited using rate_limit (to the best of ability)
10. Expiry of documents can be set using ttl parameter
    Validation of expiry of documents can be done by using --validate_expired
11. Singe instance can perform inserts, updates, deletes and validation based on the input to the script.

ex:
For creates of 1000000 document with 20K ops/sec:
python thanosied.py -U 10.112.176.101 -b default -p password -u Administrator -B 200 -c 1000000 -P 1 -v 0 -r 20000
For creates 1000000 document and update them 2 times with 20K ops/sec:
python thanosied.py -U 10.112.176.101 -b default -p password -u Administrator -B 200 -c 1000000 -P 3 -v 0 -r 20000
For updating the above 1000000 documents 2 more times with 20K ops/sec:
python thanosied.py -U 10.112.176.101 -b default -p password -u Administrator -B 200 -c 1000000 -P 2 -v 0 -r 20000 --update_counter 3
For creates of 1000000 documents and update them 2 times and delete 10000 document in the end with 20K ops/sec:
python thanosied.py -U 10.112.176.101 -b default -p password -u Administrator -B 200 -c 1000000 -P 3 -v 0 -r 20000 --delete --num_delete 10000
For creates 1000000 document and update them 2 times with 20K ops/sec and validation at the end:
python thanosied.py -U 10.112.176.101 -b default -p password -u Administrator -B 200 -c 1000000 -P 3 -v 1 -r 20000
For creates of 1000000 documents and update them 2 times and delete 10000 document in the end with 20K ops/sec and validation at end:
python thanosied.py -U 10.112.176.101 -b default -p password -u Administrator -B 200 -c 1000000 -P 3 -v 1 -r 20000 --delete --num_delete 10000
For validation without any mutation of 1000000 documents which were updated 3 times:
python thanosied.py -U 10.112.176.101 -b default -p password -u Administrator -B 200 -c 1000000 -P 3 -v 3 -r 20000 --update_counter 3

Latest patch contains following changes:
1. Review comments and suggestions from previous patches.
2. Redesigned the script slightly to have all operations in a single run
3. Included rate-limit.
