DESCRIPTION:

More readable conf files

The previous conf file format is still supported, but a conf file can
now also look like...

foo.bar.Class:
  test_hello
  test_world

In this commit, the conf/upgrade-tests.conf was also rewritten to look
like the new, more-humane format.

Line:76, testrunner -> it would be nice to support sth like a.b.c.* where we find all the test_ methods under that class and just add them one by one to tests.

Patch Set 3:

verified by running testrunner against a conf file with old and newer format.
not super happy about the syntax though. we should discuss how we can also embed the "test params" also in the conf file later or maybe turn the conf file into another .ini file
merging the change for now.
