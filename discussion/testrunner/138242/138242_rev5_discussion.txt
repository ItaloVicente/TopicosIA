DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6037: Amend bug in backup_create

The backup_create method appends a backup to a list of backups, it grabs
them from the filesystem by running 'ls' sorting in reverse order by
date modified and grabing the tail, however meta-data files may end up
in the directory listing. As we only require the backups can filter out
anything that's not a backup.

Line:623, pytests/ent_backup_restore/enterprise_backup_restore_base.py -> As you mentioned this won't work if there is a timezone you could use grep with regext to match the timezone format at the start so that \d{4}_\d{2}_\d{2}.+ type thing
