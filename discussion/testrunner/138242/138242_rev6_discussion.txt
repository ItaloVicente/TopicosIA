DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6037: Amend bug in backup_create

The backup_create method appends a backup to a list of backups, it grabs
them from the filesystem by running 'ls' sorting in reverse order by
date modified and grabing the tail, however meta-data files may end up
in the directory listing. As we only require the backups can filter out
anything that's not a backup.
