File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @pavan, @jake take a look at changes I made to base serverless ... I also decided to add some basic metering under pytest/serverless.

@ajay, we can add more basic metering/servless tc there, for now I only did basic kv read and write + query compute.

Thanks.

Line:13, pytests/serverless/serverless_basetestcase.py -> Think we need a way to come up with a standard SDK version. Some slaves run with version 2.0 , some with 3.0. It becomes difficult to make this work across all the slaves. @Pierre can you make this work with 3.0? Because the underlying objects do need these modules so I think we should remove this try, catch block.

Line:99, pytests/serverless/serverless_basetestcase.py -> There's a run_query method in pytests/gsi/serverless/base_query_serverless.py. Can we use that and remove this?

Line:13, pytests/serverless/serverless_basetestcase.py -> This will work with both as I only have 2.x but not using sdk for now if you have 3.x them the import will work but eventually we should get all to run with 3.x. If you want to use sdk you will still need 3.x.

in any case will remove in path-2

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:99, pytests/serverless/serverless_basetestcase.py -> I thought it would be better here since it can be used by other components and not just GSI. For now will keep in base class and we can revisit
