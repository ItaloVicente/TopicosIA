Patch Set 4:

The following comments by Tommie were not addressed
- Example of the working
- Add method to get data, compare and return results
- direct call to client.cbstats did not work, so the implementation still uses remote util cbstats call.

I will find the fix and post tomorrow. Not sure about cbstats though. The changes in the code have been tested. 

I will review it again for any extra spaces. Thanks again for all the feedback given so far. Ashvinder you can now comment as well.

Hi Parag,
I would like to ask a few questions that I do not understand:

1) how we get these values from the tests "result, deletedItems, addedItems, updatedItems" and what they means?

2) as I see we check vb maps and keys in them?
I do not much understand why these checks are suitable to us.
try to give an example:
we load 10 items. 2 nodes, 1 replica
knowing their ids we can and should uniquely identify active and replica vbuckets in which they must be. 
the only thing we need is to make sure that the number of items is the same for active an replica vbuckets.


3)do we plan to check the values ​​for them? if so, how we we do it and what about performance when we read CB buckets with some Gigs of data in python and then will compare values?


I probably would have got the answer to these questions, if would be examples of tests that use this functionality.
Line:19, lib/couchbase/data_analysis_helper.py -> do you have tests/example where this methods are calling? it's not clear what values( and how) we pass as parameters.
