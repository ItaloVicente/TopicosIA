Patch Set 7:

- Addressed Tommie’s comments
- Added example to extract and compare vbucket-seqno(uuid, highest seq, purge no), and failover logs before and after failover. There can be many examples, but my scope is limited for the checkin.
- All comparisons between two set A and B (state of A depending on when it is taken) are done to find if something was deleted in A, or added to A, was present in A but got updated. The user tries to answer the question if it is expected that something was added, deleted, updated (which depends on the test case)
- The cbtranfer will not be used in test cases as of now. Only post run analysis. I haven't added an example as of now, but tested it separately.

Line:114, lib/couchbase/data_analysis_helper.py -> Please add a check for verifying the types for headerInfo, sourceMap and targetMap. Also add a constructor where we are initializing the object.

Line:276, lib/couchbase/data_analysis_helper.py -> This should be '==' and not '!='
