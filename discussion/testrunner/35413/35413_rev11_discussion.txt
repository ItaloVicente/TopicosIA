Ashvinder, based on your comment for more detailed logical comparison, I have added the concept of comparison maps.

A comparison map for a given field defines ‘operation’ and ‘type’

type defines to what value it will be case. Can be {int, float, double, string}

the operation can be logical (>=, <=,<,>,==,!=) or filter which says do not test

Example: {“uuid”:{“operation”:”>=“,”type”:”int”}

Whenever we do not define comparisonMap, the operations are not performed, we only check for equality of values by assuming they are string.

By using the comparison map, one can define different logical comparison on different fields.

thanks parag for the example!

few more comments.
+ another part i'm very interested in is the use of cbtransfer for dataverification.  I'm concerned it's always pointing to localhost.
Line:58, pytests/failover/failoverbasetests.py -> here you can call self.get_failover_logs() above,

Line:60, pytests/failover/failoverbasetests.py -> everything here is set to False.  this makes it impossible to dynamically set these params externally.  also if they were variables passed into function with default=False then what they represent would be more readable.  ie

compare_failovers_logs(.... addedItems = False, DeletedItems = False ..)

Line:64, pytests/failover/failoverbasetests.py -> False, True, False...  hardcoded

Line:68, pytests/failover/failoverbasetests.py -> call self.get_vbucket_seqnos

Line:164, pytests/failover/failovertests.py -> looks like syntax error

Line:167, pytests/failover/failovertests.py -> a bit trivial, but you can consolidate logic here wihout if/else:

servers = (_servers_, self.servers)[self.add_back_flag]

self.compare_vbucket_seqnos(prev_vbucket_stats,servers,self.buckets)	         self.compare_failovers_logs(prev_failovers_stats,servers,self.buckets)

Line:171, pytests/failover/failovertests.py -> w/spc
