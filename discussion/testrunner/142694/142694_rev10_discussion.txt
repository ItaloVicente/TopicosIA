DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6270: Test with client certificates and enable ssl verification

Supply ssl hints to the HttpsConfigurationFactory which can contain the
name of the cluster-wide root certificate, client private key and
certificate. These ssl hints are passed to the HttpsConfigurationFactory
to which then passes these to the configuration that is created which in
turn enables ssl verification.

Created classes ClientStrategy and ClientCertificateTester which assist
in generating client private keys and certificates which have been
signed by the cluster-wide private key. The ClientStrategy defines how
the username is obtained from the certificate by Couchbase.

Created a 'load_custom_certificates' function which absorbs the previous
custom certificate code and further uses the ClientStrategy and
ClientCertificateTester classes to generate the client private key and
certificates. The function requires the 'use_https' flag to be set. The
function is hidden by the 'custom_certificates' flag, if this flag is
set then custom certificates and custom client certificates are enabled.
