DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-7116: Installation failing on upgrade
tests due to recent changes on install
scripts to install debug info

Due to changes in install scripts to install
debug info builds, upgrade tests are
failing on builds where debug info builds aren't
present. Fixing this by not failing the install
if no debug info builds are present. Instead
we will now just print that no debug info builds
are present and we will just move on with the
installation.

Bharath, Overall ok. A couple of minor comments to see if you can clarify or take care now or next iteration.
Line:757, scripts/install_utils.py -> Bharath, Why ok = True again? At this stage, it should be True and no need to reset again, right?

Line:771, scripts/install_utils.py -> Bharath, Why do you need to set the given debug url to None? We can preserve the given values without setting this as anyways you are relying on the debug_build_present flag to do the action.

Line:757, scripts/install_utils.py -> This is done so that ok is set per node. It makes more sense logically to set it to true for each node.

Line:771, scripts/install_utils.py -> This was to remove python warnings of uninitialised variables and to add more fail safes for the debug info builds.
