Need a conf file too to run the tests. Pls create a new conf file or add the tests to an existing conf file
Line:691, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> This block could be simply written as :
bucket_name = self.buckets[0].name

Line:698, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Eliminate hard sleep by checking the stats periodically for availability of the 2 disk snapshots

Line:702, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> use self.assertTrue instead

Line:724, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> same as above, avoid using hard sleeps

Line:880, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Remove this test if it has no implementation

Line:925, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> should the self.master node have index service? what if it is not having indexer service. It is better to determine at runtime which is the index node, and use that.

Line:485, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> can you fix the formatting for these types of cases so its only one indent over? this can have impact on py2 to p3 tranisition

Line:485, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> The indentation was done by PyCharm IDE as these lines were not in accordance with PEP8. If you think this will create issue in migration to Python 3, I'll revert it back.

Line:691, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Done

Line:698, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Done

Line:702, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Done

Line:724, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Done

Line:880, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> Done

Line:925, pytests/2i/recovery_2i.py -> This test is written with a certain cluster topology in mind. If would like to evaluate the node configs at runtime, that will unnecessarily complicate the code. 

Let me know if this is desired behaviour, I'll change the code then at other places as well.
