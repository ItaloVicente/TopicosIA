DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-1842 : Makefile changes for view-tests.
Cleaned up the code for multiple instances of test-view-XXX to singular
test-viewmerge for a 4 node cluster. Merged py-premerge and py-view-merge as singular
py-viewmerge.conf to run before merging any view related code. The new
syntax for view-merge tests now is : make test-viewmerge

Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

So py-viewmerge.conf was added because I requested it ages ago. Its purpose is to exercise the query layer only of the view engine. Basically it's a replacement for the Futon (JavaScript) tests I have written for this, but are not usable anymore since before 2.0 PM decided to remove many REST interfaces that were CouchDB specific and a security issue for Couchbase (like creating and deleting databases, for e.g.).

I would prefer to continue having this test suite as it is, i.e. no tests related to anything but exercising only the query layer.

I see this test suite as something to maintain/update for people working on views and not so much for QE. It could even be moved into the couchdb repository, but it would make it complicated.
