DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6037: Fetch uid and uid dynamically when configuring NFS

Accesses to the NFS are mapped to the couchbase user and group. These
are hard-coded. In the situation where another user and group have
already taken these numbers, the NFS share will not work as intended. To
avoid running into this situation, we can fetch the uid and gid
dynamically.
