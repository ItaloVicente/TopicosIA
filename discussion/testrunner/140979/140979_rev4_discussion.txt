DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6167: Avoid sharing staging directories

This is a subset of the original due to Python3/Python2
incompatabilities, the compatability being that you cannot parse rfc3339
easily in Python2 without importing an external library.

This patch takes the following subset of the original patch:

It is no longer possible to share staging directories between
cbbackupmgr and cbriftdump.

Hence, we can use a temporary staging directory for cbriftdump to
prevent a clash with the staging directory used by cbbackupmgr.
