DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6037: Amended backup_service_client to return http error codes

To make the test code easier to read, I amended the
backup_service_client to return http error codes as opposed to throwing
an ApiException on failure. This means we can write test cases which
simply check the http error code as opposed to checking if an exception
is thrown / not thrown.
