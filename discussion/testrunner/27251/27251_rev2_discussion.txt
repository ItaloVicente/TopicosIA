Hi Abhinav, 

I have a few comments on the code. Could you take a look?

Let me know if you have qs.

thanks, 
Ketaki
Line:2, conf/py-memorysanitytests.conf -> This is the test case related to "create/delete bucket" for memory footprint?

Line:5, conf/py-memorysanitytests.conf -> Can you also add one test w/ 20M on the same suite?

Line:121, pytests/memorysanitytests.py -> Could you explain is the app-ratio defined here? I am not sure I understand the usage of this.

Line:151, pytests/memorysanitytests.py -> Do we check the data-content for the large size items?

Line:2, conf/py-memorysanitytests.conf -> Yes it is, we never had these tests in a conf file, figured i'd add them here.

Line:5, conf/py-memorysanitytests.conf -> I will, once I hear back about the rest of the comments.

Line:121, pytests/memorysanitytests.py -> so the user gets to pick a ratio of the items inserted initially to do the appends on, selected_keys will be that ratio of all_keys that'll undergo append-updates.

Line:151, pytests/memorysanitytests.py -> so in verification, right now we just check if all the appended items have data sizes as what was expected, but no we dont check what the content is.
