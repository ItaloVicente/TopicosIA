DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-707: XDCR's load_with_failover_master

- Change in the bucket's master id
- As the master is being failed over, the bucket's
master_id will need to be updated as well. As the bucket's
master_id wasn't updated, no bucket was being returned,
causing erratic verification to occur.

Change-Id: Ia983cca2afcb53a980331a67611cbc897b98843c
