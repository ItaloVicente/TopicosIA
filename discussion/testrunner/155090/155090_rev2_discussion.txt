Line:6, conf/entbackuprestore/entbackuprestore-ce.conf -> Scope/Collection level restore is also EE only - need a test for that
How do we handle backup service being available in EE only? should that be a separate conf file or just include it here?

I think that may fall into a different category, since the expected behaviour is that you wouldn't be able to initialise a node with the backup service, meaning you'd never get access to tools.
Since the behaviour for backup service hasn't changed, I think it should stay separate to cbbackupmgr.
