DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6037: Skip fetching cluster stats

When modifying the time, the cluster stats stop working.

Previously running a schedule test would break the one off tests as
they modifying the time, consequently preventing the stats from being
fetched causing the test to fail.

By skipping the fetching of the cluster stats, we can avoid running into
this situation and create Conf files which contain both one off test and
schedule tests.
