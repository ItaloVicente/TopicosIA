Line:1433, pytests/viewtests.py -> This is still not race condition free Iryna.

After deleting the development design doc, automatic update of the production index can happen (if number of changes is greater than default of 5000, or if the default was lowered), and therefore the stale=ok query has a chance of seeing an index with same content as before the development design document was deleted.

See my previous comment that pointed to:

Line:1433, pytests/viewtests.py -> but there are no changes at all after deleting or after querying first time, and also number of items is only 1000, is obviously less than 5000. Is there still a chance that changes will be greater than 5000?

Line:1433, pytests/viewtests.py -> Doesn't matter Iryna.

The default is 5000, one day that might change, or maybe someone parametrizes the test to run with more than 5000 docs, and if the regression is re-introduced there's good chances the test won't detect the regression.

From what I see for all the tests, number of docs is not hardcoded. Even if it was, it's not good practice to assume 5000 will always be the default in the server, or that some previous test in the same suite didn't change that default.
