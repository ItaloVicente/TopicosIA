Patch Set 1: Verified

(2 inline comments)

looks good and verified it ran, but two inline comments
Line:549, pytests/viewtests.py -> If the test is 10_mins, reading the params seems awkward

Line:596, pytests/viewtests.py -> Is there a need for this parameter, instead of just making a second test? Basically one test without this, and one test with this.

Line:549, pytests/viewtests.py -> yeah will clean this up before merging the code.

Line:596, pytests/viewtests.py -> sure. I will split this into three tests and remove this parameter.

run view for 1 mins , 10 mins and one for 60 mins so that we can run them manually..
