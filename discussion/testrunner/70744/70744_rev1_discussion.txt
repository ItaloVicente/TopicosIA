Patch Set 1:

Looks like the merge has created changes that have been distributed across several commits and consequently have picked up some commits in the train that are already in master (so it re-writes history a bit).   Sandip, the cleaner way to do this is to make a single change with all your modifications and apply it directly to testrunner/master.  However, the merge here will also work if that cannot be done, just note the side effect on history means revert may not be to straight forward.

Sorry, this change isn't 'rewriting' history but is 'merging' -ng commits into master.

Note the following for review - as being merged from -ng branch:
