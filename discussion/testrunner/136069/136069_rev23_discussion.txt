Line:385, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> You can do the wait in a smarter way to avoid running into cases where this test fails beacuase backup is being slow.

You can check the running task endpoint andwait until the task in question is no longer running. You can assume the task is no longer running if the task name is no longer in the running one offs dictionary. You can take it even further to avoid the task haning you can run that function in a seoearate thread and run a timer so that if you are waiting for more than X seconds it will fail.

Line:434, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> probably should be lwoer case/

Line:454, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> This function seems to be adding not importing

Line:469, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> (Nitpicking) The spacing here seems a bit off

Line:168, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_base.py -> This part is a relic of when I was querying the info endpoint to determine when a test is done. I'll improve this function in a future commit.

Line:385, pytests/ent_backup_restore/backup_service_test.py -> Thanks for catching this.

I just refactored this out into a function which waits until the running_one_off is not present and then checks the task is present in the task history.
