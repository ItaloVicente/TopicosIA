DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-2592: Extend 2i Recovery Tests

- Added params targetIndexManager, targetMaster:
when these nodes participate in topology change or recovery operations
- Added param targetProcess to define the process which we will crash to restart ns_server's babysitter process:
(indexer/memcached/projector). Added tests for the same
- Added tests for rebalance-in-out with stop/start rebalance
- Added support for ops during recovery.
- Removed bucket definitions from test conf since they will be passed as global parameters
- Not added tests for ops during recovery as these can be controlled via global params
- Note that it is not possible for us to know which is the index manager as of now.
Assumption is that the first indexer node ends up as the index manager
