DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6459: Fix ipv6 backup sanity test case

Fix the ipv6 backup sanity test case's index out of bounds exception

What's the problem?:

The ipv6 backup recovery sanity test fails with an index out of bounds
exception.

This is because an empty list is returned by the get_nodes_in_cluster
function.

An empty list is returned because the rest.get_nodes_statuses() method
returns the IP address as '[::1]' as opposed the IP address that is
supplied in the ini file.

This causes a comparison between the list of servers in the ini file and
the list returned by cluster to fail returning an empty list of
TestInputServer objects that are supposed to be in the cluster.

What's the fix:

Replace rest.get_nodes_statuses() with rest.get_nodes() in In
pytests/basetestcase.py:get_nodes_in_cluster()

The rest.get_nodes() function returns a list of nodes with their IP
address set to the one in ini file.

____

Comment out the dist_cfg write as an experiment.
