DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6459: Fix ipv6 backup sanity test case

Fix the ipv6 backup sanity test case's index out of bounds exception

What's the problem?:

The ipv6 backup recovery sanity test fails with an index out of bounds
exception.

This is because an empty list is returned by the get_nodes_in_cluster
function.

An empty list is returned because the rest.get_nodes_statuses() method
returns the IP address as '[::1]' as opposed the IP address that is
supplied in the ini file.

This is due to an edge case where it doesn't consider ipv6 local
addresses.

This causes a comparison between the list of servers in the ini file and
the list returned by cluster to fail returning an empty list of
TestInputServer objects that are supposed to be in the cluster.

What's the fix:

Add the edge condition to rest.get_nodes_statuses()
____

Comment out the dist_cfg write as an experiment.
