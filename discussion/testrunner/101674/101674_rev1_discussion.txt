Line:103, pytests/failover/AutoFailoverAbortsRebalance.py -> Sleep is too high, almost like 8+ minutes.

Line:156, pytests/failover/AutoFailoverAbortsRebalance.py -> Is there a better way to validate this ? Hopefully validation of logs does not take long, considering that you are only picking up last 10 line of the logs

Line:223, pytests/failover/AutoFailoverAbortsRebalance.py -> Can this validation be abstracted, seems you are doing it in few tests

Line:243, pytests/failover/AutoFailoverAbortsRebalance.py -> Too large sleep, almost like 8+ minutes, is there a stat available to pool

Line:103, pytests/failover/AutoFailoverAbortsRebalance.py -> I tried from 300-500, Since there are 3 buckets , each containing 100k docs, failover is taking this much time. I ran this test around 10 times, it average around 450s for graceful failover to complete.

If its less than 500 I see the following error.
SetRecoveryTypeFailed: Set RecoveryType failed :{"otpNode":"invalid node name or node can't be used for delta recovery"} 

Log : http://qa.sc.couchbase.com/job/temp_rebalance_even/609/consoleText

Alternatively I can do a hard failover or reduce the number of docs. What do you suggest?

Line:156, pytests/failover/AutoFailoverAbortsRebalance.py -> Actually I did not have this initially. Abhi insisted this to be added when I sent him the review last time.

See http://review.couchbase.org/#/c/100880/2/pytests/failover/AutoFailoverAbortsRebalance.py@78 for more details.
