DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-1155 Fix issue in stats wait

Waiting for stats ep_queue_size and ep_flusher_todo asynchronously is not correct.
First we need to wait for ep_queue_size to reach 0 and then ep_flusher_todo.
Thread waiting for ep_flusher_todo finishes before ep_queue_size reaches 0.
So effectively we are waiting for only ep_queue_size to reach 0

I don't see how it depends on CBQE-1155. For both threads we wait for the same timeout time. asynchronously we can track the changes for different stats. 
Don't see any issues with asynchronous approach

The issue is not in the timeouts. The items are first reflected in the ep_queue_size stat and then in ep_flusher_todo. 

Let say you have thread t1 for ep_queue_size and thread t2  for ep_flusher_todo.

Consider the below transition for these 2 stats after loading 100K items and starting both t1 and t2 asynchronously.

ep_queue_size | ep_flusher_todo 

100000        | 0     --->> t2 finishes 
50000         | 50000 --->> ep_flusher_todo has items now, but t2 is already done.
0             | 100000 --->> t1 finishes. but items are still not persisted.

It's almost unreal case have 100K items in ep_queue_size and do not have any in ep_flusher_todo. even if there is such a situation, it is a system error and we have to catch it: Will it seems that ep_queue_size and ep_flusher_todo changes sequentially rather than asynchronously. 
do you have an example, when 
ep_queue_size =100.. and ep_flusher_todo =0?

there is no timeouts for wait for stats. So if there would be a bug and queue never will be 0 for example the test will hung

Line:352, pytests/basetestcase.py -> You do not wait until all tasks are completed

This always happens on win32 VMs we have on EC2 and once happened on our internal VM. Its very easy to reproduce the case where ep_queue_size =100.. and ep_flusher_todo =0. You can run any test from conf/py-createview.conf on a m1.medium win32 instance in EC2. These stats change sequentially so waiting from asynchronously is not the right thing to do.
Line:352, pytests/basetestcase.py -> wait_for_stats has default timeout=None, so the task will keep waiting until the stat condition in met, i.e. in this case the queue becomes 0. No need to wait explicitly. I'll change the call to pass the timeout values in the argument to the task so it doesn't keep waiting infinitely as Iryna has mentioned.
