DESCRIPTION:

Always apply bucket storage to bucket creation params

For some reason we only apply this in the case of buckets of type
membase and this seems to cause problems in certain situations
especially in the rebalancein tests. For some reason this does not
seem to always exhibit itself, so there must be some element of timing
involved. The creation of buckets is asynchronous so it's probably a
race regarding that. Regardless, this seems to fix the issue and it
only makes sense that we apply the same value to the creation, and the
Bucket object we append to keep track of it.

Patch Set 1: Verified+1

Hey -- I was having major issues with "simple-test" and it seems like there's a race or something involving the "bucket_storage" field. I do not know this codebase, but it seems like we should be applying this generally and not just in situations where we specify "membase" as the type. It seems to fix the issue I was running into. Please advise.. Thanks! (Also, I didn't know who to add to review, so anyone who has committed recently got added)

Actually, magma storage is not supported for ephemeral buckets, so this is the change I'm proposing:
