Line:313, pytests/viewtests.py -> can you check the rebalance helper
i think Karan has already made a change which loops over all nodes and waits for eq-queue==0 on all of them

Line:339, pytests/viewtests.py -> so we loop around 6 times until we don't see those deleted items anymore ?
how many items are we deleting here?
what is the ratio of items versus deleted ones ?

Line:313, pytests/viewtests.py -> Done

Line:339, pytests/viewtests.py -> the number of docs, and the number of deleted docs is paramaterized, so it can be anything. for the initial test it just deletes one document.

basically it allows 60 for the deletions. obviously it is going to take some amount of time, but I'm not sure what that time should be, based on how many documents we have, and how many we are deleting.

Line:339, pytests/viewtests.py -> yeah instead of loopong like that we should just wait for the indexing task to complete before getting the views.
you can get the running tasks from _active_tasks ( i dont think we have this in rest_client yet)

if we dont have that in rest_client then let's make that change as part of a different commit
