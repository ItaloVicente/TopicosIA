DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6390: Also sort the list self.servers

The self.servers list must also be sorted based on the order in
self.input.clusters[0]. This is required as testrunner uses the first
element in this list to determine the main node.

This resulted in a bug where the cbadminbucket node being created on an
arbitrary node and then being deleted when the node the user existed on
was rebalanced in.

In addition skip the log scan as it seems to hang with this change.
