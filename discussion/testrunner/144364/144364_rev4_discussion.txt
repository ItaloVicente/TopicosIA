DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-6390: Also sort the list self.servers

The self.servers list must also be sorted based on the order in
self.input.clusters[0]. This is required as testrunner uses the first
element in this list to determine the main node.

This resulted in a bug where the cbadminbucket node being created on an
arbitrary node and then being deleted when the node the user existed on
was rebalanced in.
