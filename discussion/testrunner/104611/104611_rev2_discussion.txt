DESCRIPTION:

1. Fixed error messages in Basic integration tests. They have changed recently.
2. Disabled cbindex move tests since the tool is not supported, so it will reduce maintenance for QE. These scenarios are already covered via alter index move index tests.
3. Fixed a few tests for rebalance where querying was in progress while the same node was being removed from the cluster.
