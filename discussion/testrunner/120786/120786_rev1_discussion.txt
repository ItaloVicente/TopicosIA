Patch Set 1:

Please use this new as I have created because of earlier we had 2 different transactions than patches and also had the 2nd one with merge conflict.

This transaction had all earlier changes and the below new changes based on some feedback.
1. option name change from includetests/excludetests to include_tests/exclude_tests 
2. removed extra fail=True line.

Constants side: I will discuss and do next iteration as current testconstants.py is more related to the tests than runner and might need to introduce or use same.

Please review and give score for checkin or else give me must fix changes as discussed Yesterday. 
Thanks for your time.

Can you please add more information in the commit message? Refer https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/ for guidelines. We should start having better commit messages in all our checkins. Irrespective of how big or small the change is. That should be the guidelines for any commits.
Line:62, testrunner.py -> Can you split this into multiple lines? Not able to see the entire example on gerrit. The pep8 standard is to limit each line to a max of 72 characters. This is same for all the lines below.

Line:136, testrunner.py -> Do we have to pass a empty string to this method? It's better to have default parameter for the parameter as an empty string rather than send empty string.

Line:146, testrunner.py -> Remove dead/unnecessary code/comments.

Line:171, testrunner.py -> Can we use logger instead of the print statements? I know the whole of testrunner is filled with print statements. But we should avoid using print since it's inefficient to use print and also prevents us from filtering logs if required. Using logger is the preferred way to log warnings/information/errors.

Line:348, testrunner.py -> Catch any exceptions thrown here and handle it. If wrong file path is provided, can it be caught and can we show error and exit the testrunner like in the case above?

Line:759, testrunner.py -> Refactor this into a function maybe? Since this is being used in multiple places.

Line:783, testrunner.py -> Catch and handle any exceptions from this.

Thanks for review. I will submit the 2nd patch. Nothing is specifically said must fix vs next iteration. About the commit message, in general we have the JIRA and high level changes. Again, we can see how much to add in the commit message in our upcoming new guidelines.
Line:62, testrunner.py -> Ok. For now, I will put as 100 as in the gerrit review. Otherwise, it can be 72 (for docstring or comments) or 79 or 99 as per PEP-8 doc also. We need to discuss about this optional is the right value for hard margin for PyCharm editor (which is setting 122). When I set 72, it is showing as very narrowed column with our high resolution mac laptops.

Line:136, testrunner.py -> Ok. Will update.

Line:146, testrunner.py -> Ok. will remove.

Line:171, testrunner.py -> Yeah..I thought of doing but to be consistent, I kept that way and later refactor only for logging. 
Anyways, I will change to logging at some level for now but we need to see what is the best way if we need to print all the time vs. optional as with logger.

Line:348, testrunner.py -> This is not throwing any exception and it is absorbed. I have tested it.

Line:759, testrunner.py -> Yes. It is already added (filter_fields function) and missed to update here. will modify.

Line:783, testrunner.py -> This is not throwing any error/exception except empty string.
