For now, log message and continue on the install when there is a ntp setup issue instead of stopping the install.

Line:1148, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> So this will ignore, if there is failure in ntp setup. But we should install ntp properly before the test run, right?

Line:1148, lib/remote/remote_util.py -> Yes. We should go through such machines and resolve/file IT tickets.
In this current given failed machine, then repo interaction failed and also time difference was about 2hrs. I have set the current time but ntp package/yum update is failing on this host, which we need to take it to IT. But this current machine should go through as the time is same as current now.
