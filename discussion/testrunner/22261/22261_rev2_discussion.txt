DESCRIPTION:

CBQE-730: implement EXCLUDE_GROUP in testrunner

now we have GROUP feature that allows us to execute specific cases from conf-file
it would be nice to add the opposite group to be stronger than that- EXCLUDE_GROUP
we will carry out only those GROUPs that are present in the command line (or will take all, if no one is specified),
but not contained in the EXCLUDE_GROUP group if it's specified
