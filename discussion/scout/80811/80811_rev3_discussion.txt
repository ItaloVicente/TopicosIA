DESCRIPTION:

Tree: Don't re-decorate node on selection change

Re-decorating the node on selection change is unnecessary, as only the
'group' class has to be re-assigned correctly.

This also fixes a bug on Firefox, when the tree field did not get the
selection when the user click directly on the text of a node (because
apparently setting the same text again breaks the click event's target).
