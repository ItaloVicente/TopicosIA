DESCRIPTION:

TableFooter: update internal state when text filter is changed

When the server sends a "filtersChanged" event and one of the filters is
a TableTextUserFilter, the current table text user filter is removed
(clearing the filter field and clearing the internal "current filter
text" property on the table footer). When the new filter is added, the
filter field is updated, but the internal state was not updated. This
caused _applyFilter() to do nothing when the text was cleared, because
the internal state was empty as well.
Fix: like _onTableFilterRemoved, _onTableFilterAdded must not only set
the value to the text field but also update the internal state.
