DESCRIPTION:

Added DataObjectHolder for all IDataObject types (e.g. DoLists)

DoEntityHolder is now a sub class of DataObjectHolder with more
specific types.

Added method DataObjectHelper#getTypeName to read TypeName annotation
from a DO entity at runtime.

Added method throwingMerger() to use the 4 argument version of the
Collectors#toMap method, in order to create a specific HashMap type,
like LinkedHashMap. Instead of declaring a specific lambda each time,
we can now use the throwingMerger function, which is default in the
JRE too, but declared as private, so it cannot be used from outside.
