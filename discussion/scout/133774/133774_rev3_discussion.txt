DESCRIPTION:

Add Cancellation and exception handling support to REST clients

Wrap REST client objects into a proxy that allows to cancel the ongoing
request and that transparently transforms unsuccessful responses into
appropriate exceptions.

Cancellation support is provided by executing synchronous invocations
asynchronously and actually by canceling the async execution only. The
invoked service however cannot be cancelled in general.

Additionally, this commit allows more than 2 concurrent connections and
it fixes an exception in Apache HTTP client which has led to resource
leaks.
