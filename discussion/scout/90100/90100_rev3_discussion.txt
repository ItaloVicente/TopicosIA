DESCRIPTION:

Tree: Prevent changing checked state of disabled tree nodes

Disabled tree nodes must not be checked/unchecked from the UI, i.e. via
mouse or keyboard events. The model may still change the state.

Tree.js:
- Added enabled check in mouse down listener

TableToggleRowKeyStroke.js, TreeSpaceKeyStroke.js:
- Added enabled check in space keystrokes.
- Adjusted the two implementations to each other (same functionality).
- Instead of setting the checked state of each selected row/node to the
  opposite of the current state of the first selected row/node, set the
  checked state to 'true', except of already all rows/nodes are checked.
  This is a more natural behavior.
