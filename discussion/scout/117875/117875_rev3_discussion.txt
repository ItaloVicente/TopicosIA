DESCRIPTION:

Add Widget visitor to support FormFieldMenu & FormFieldTile

Until now in Scout FormFields could only exist in composites. Since the
introduction of FormFieldMenu & FormFieldTile fields can also exist
within other items that are part of the form (and are no form fields).
Therefore a new concept is required to traverse all fields (e.g. for
FormData import or form validation).
First a generic tree traversal engine has been added to the platform
utilities. It can be used to traverse any tree like data structures.
This engine is used to implement a widget visitor that can traverse over
all widgets (forms, fields, actions, trees, tables, menus, tiles,
etc..). The existing visitors for fields, actions and trees have been
replaced by this new widget visitor.
Furthermore until now the child-propagation of logic like isEmpty,
isSaveNeeded, etc. has been implemented on composite level. But now
nested fields can also exist outside of a composite. Therefore these
operations have been moved to IFormField and respect the fact that child
fields could also exist on a not-composite-field using the menus.
