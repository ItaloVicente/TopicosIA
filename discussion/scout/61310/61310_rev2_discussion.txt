DESCRIPTION:

Fix job regression related to thread interruption

If a thread is waiting for a condition to fall and gets interrupted, that thread does not immediately exit with an InterruptedException. That is because a thread's interruption is asynchronous, meaning that once a thread (a) interrupts another threads (b), and in turn thread (a) unblocks the condition which thread (b) is waiting for, it is not ensured that thread (b) exists with an {@link InterruptedException}. However, many tests expect exactly that behavior.
