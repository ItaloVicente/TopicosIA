DESCRIPTION:

FormField: support horizontal alignment inside FormFieldMenus

FormFieldMenu.js:
FormFieldMenu does not have a logical grid, therefore the "gridData" has
to be set manually according to "gridDataHints". This must happen before
rendering the field, otherwise the field will not pick up the desired
alignment (because the "gridData" property still contains the default
values).

FormField.js:
Because some inner elements are positioned absolutely (e.g. the clear
icon), the form field layout must be invalidated after the inner
alignment classes have been updated. Otherwise, dynamically toggling the
"gridDataHints.horizontalAlignment" property would not be rendered
correctly.

FormFieldLayout.js:
The "gridDataHints.horizontalAlignment" property affects the position of
the clear icon. When the value is changed, the corresponding opposite
position has to be cleared (only one of the CSS properties "left" or
"right" must be present).
