DESCRIPTION:

IClientSession.stop can block in custom code

Http session timeout, logout and custom calls to IClientSession.stop
must stop and dispose the client session and all its forms and
resources. However if some form or listener that is called synchronously
by processing stop then the stop is not guaranteed to proceed.

This change summarizes all stop, check, cancel and detect code ion the
new @Bean ClientSessionStopHelper.

The IClientSession.stop process starts a background loop with
ClientSessionStopHelper.scheduleJobTerminationLoop that continuously
detects and cancels jobs that are somehow blocking or taking too long.

That tool still gives no 100% guarantee for session stop but it takes
all efforts to come near that goal.

The property that defines how long is 'too long' for a job to run is
(still) defined in JobCompletionDelayOnSessionShutdown with a default of
10 seconds per detection round.

Line:124, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/session/ClientSessionStopHelper.java -> do not use thread Sleep here! this blocks the thread for Nothing. instead let the Task end and re-schedule a new one with the cooldown delay

Line:222, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/session/ClientSessionStopHelper.java -> This is the same Code as createCancelJobsFilter().
Call createCancelJobsFilter inside createRunningJobsFilter instead?

Line:471, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/ui/html/SessionStore.java -> why use tryLock() here and lock() in checkHttpSessionOutsideWriteLock? Either there can be long waits but then both Methods should use tryLock and handle the timeout correctly or both should use lock?

Line:472, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/ui/html/SessionStore.java -> I would move this try into the loop so that if there is an error in one removeClientSessionInsideWriteLock the other sessions are still removed

Line:480, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/ui/html/SessionStore.java -> I would move this very important call into a finally block of the outer try to ensure it is called.

Line:485, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/ui/html/SessionStore.java -> here the m_clientSessionMap should be cleared?

Line:489, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/ui/html/SessionStore.java -> here we should either try again or the m_clientSessionMap should be cleared

Line:490, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/ui/html/SessionStore.java -> in this method we should ensure the ui sessions are all disposed! As the http session is invalid already, the corresponding ui sessions can be disposed because they cannot be accessed anyway. otherwise the disposal of the ui session relies on the stop of the Client session which is not guaranteed. Furthermore the local Maps should be cleared here too?

Line:501, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/ui/html/SessionStore.java -> this is never true?

Line:507, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/ui/html/SessionStore.java -> Invert condition instead of an empty true case and a "return" false case
