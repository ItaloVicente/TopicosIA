DESCRIPTION:

Fix Rest Client Proxy Test

Helper configuration should be finished before getting first web target.
Configuring client after getting target leads to copy-on-change strategy
for internal configuration state and associated client runtime instance.
If config is manipulated after runtime was initialized this may lead to
multiple client runtime instances. If one tests finishes, the associated
runtime is closed (by finalizer). This leads to closing the underlying
connection pool which is shared among different client runtime
instances.
