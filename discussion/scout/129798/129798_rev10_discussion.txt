DESCRIPTION:

add close all/other tabs menu to DesktopTab

The two new context menus on DesktopTabs allow to close all/other tabs
on the desktop.
To close several forms with unsaved changes, the user is prompted with
the UnsavedFormChangesForm. This form allows to choose which of the
unsaved changes should be saved/discarded.
Support for this functionality is available in Scout Classic as well as
in ScoutJS.
