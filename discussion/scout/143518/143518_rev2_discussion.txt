DESCRIPTION:

TableFooter: fix info animation

When an info element is made visible while the 'hiding' animation is
still running, the resulting size is wrong. This is because the
animation is stopped but the 'hiding' data attribute is still present.

This can happen when the column structure changes while a text filter
is present. Because the filter is first removed, the filter $info
element will shortly be made invisible. After the filter is re-applied,
it is made visible again.

Fix: after the 'hiding' animation is stopped, the 'hiding' data
attribute must be removed as well. This must be done manually, because
calling $el.stop() does _not_ run the "complete" callback function.
(See http://api.jquery.com/stop/: "Callback functions are not called")
