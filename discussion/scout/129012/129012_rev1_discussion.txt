DESCRIPTION:

AbstractForm: Ensure form is always disposed on close

Forms and all fields are disposed automatically when the form is closed
using doClose(), doOk() or doCancel(). However, if the form is not open,
those methods did nothing. This can lead to a memory leak when the form
or a form field allocated resources on creation time and the form is
then closed without ever having opened it.

This was fixed by always calling disposeFormInternal() in doClose(),
doOk() and doCancel(), even if the form is not currently open.
