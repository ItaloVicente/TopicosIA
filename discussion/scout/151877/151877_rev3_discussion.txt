DESCRIPTION:

TreeEventBuffer: don't remove deleted nodes from ORDER_CHANGED event

Nodes of a NODES_DELETED event are usually removed from all preceding
events, since the node will be removed anyway. However, this is not
correct for CHILD_NODE_ORDER_CHANGED events. When the UI processes them,
the node to be deleted still exists and therefore the tree thrown a JS
error "Node order may not be updated because lengths of the arrays
differ" when the event has fewer nodes than expected.

The fix changes the TreeEventBuffer such that it only removes deleted
nodes from a CHILD_NODE_ORDER_CHANGED event when this event is preceded
by a NODES_INSERTED event (in which case the node will be completely
removed from all events).
