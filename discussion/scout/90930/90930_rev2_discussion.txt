DESCRIPTION:

BasicField: Fix acceptInput(false) if updateDisplayTextOnModify=true

In some cases, 'displayTextChanged' events with whileTyping=false was
not sent, even if the display text _was_ changed previously because of
updateDisplayTextOnModify=true. This resulted in a mismatch between UI
and model (i.e. entered text was lost).

BasicField was refactored in the following way:
- Scheduled "acceptInput(true)" is always correctly cancelled and
  executed immediately. The timeoutId variable is always set to null.
- _checkDisplayTextChanged() was simplified. There is now only one
  specific case where the original "displayTextChanged" value is
  overridden with true.
- When the property "updateDisplayTextOnModify" changes from true to
  false, a pending "acceptInput(true)" is run immediately _before_
  changing the property value.
- BasicFieldSpec.js was fixed (expected event was wrong) and extended.
