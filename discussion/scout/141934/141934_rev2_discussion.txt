DESCRIPTION:

JMS: handle interrupt and harden connection management

Thread.interrupt while activemq is in an IO operation not only
interrupts that operation but also kills and disposes the complete jms
connection to the server. This behaviour is valid in theory but wrong in
practice. A Thread.interrupt should not terminate the connection and
therefore the sessions of other threads.

This fix handles auto-failover in the scout jms wrapper and ensures
seamless continuation of subscriber listeners as well as subsequent
publish operations.
