DESCRIPTION:

Protect access to resource loaders

The resource loaders
(org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html.res.loader.IResourceLoader) are used to
load resources on the UI server and send them to the browser.
The current implementation of the
org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html.res.loader.IconLoader does not validate the
requested resource path which allows to request any resource on the UI
server classpath.
This requires a special GET request crafted to bypass the servlet
containers URI validation which only validates forward-slashes (/). But
if backslash-path delimters are passed to the server these are accepted
by the container and forwarded to the servlet.
Because ClassLoaders and Java File API supports both slash types this
allows to access resources outside of folders that are designed to be
accessible by clients.

The following example request bypasses the URI validation of the
container and uses
1. the IconLoader which does not validate the requested path
2. and the capability of the java ClassLoader to understand backslashes
as path delimiters:
http://localhost:8082/icon/..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5C..%5Cconfig.properties

In that example the config.properties file of the UI Server is returned
to the client. This properties file contains sensitive information like
passwords or private keys.
In general any resource on the classpath can be accessed. This includes
class files which allows to dump the whole application byte code.

The /icon/ path of a Scout application is typically only available for
logged in users. Therefore (if this default configuration is not
changed) a valid login is required to perform the attack.
