DESCRIPTION:

Prevent waking up the poller unnecessarily on "timed out" errors

When the model job to display the "request timed out" error is executed,
the m_processingJsonRequest flag is already reset, even though the user
request technically is still being processed. This causes the poller to
be signaled unnecessarily. To let the "UI data available listener" to
ignore this job, a special execution was added.
