DESCRIPTION:

Support for http POST redirects

Redirects of http GET and POST requests (often to the original URL)
typically takes place in web application firewalls (WAF) and reverse
proxy authentication filters.

The original LaxRedirectStrategy basically supports redirecting POST
requests but it lacks to re-send another POST request and instead sends
a GET request.

The EnhancedLaxRedirectStrategy that is used here re-sends the original
POST request to the redirected URL.

Added new config property "scout.http.redirectPost" default true.

Added new method ApacheHttpTransportFactory.addRedirectSettings
