DESCRIPTION:

Add support for form from extension properties in form state xml

IFormExtensions may contribute additional properties to an existing
form. They should be written to and loaded from a form state xml.

NOTE: field properties (as well as those contributed by
IFormFieldExtensions) were not added to the form state xml. This
behavior is not changed.
