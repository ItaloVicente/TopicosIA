DESCRIPTION:

Fix csv import to keep all sample in batched load

When a csv is loaded in batches and the stream reader is kept open, the
ready will loose a sample per batch. The reason is, that the loop
first reads a line and then the check is done if the batch has already
read completely. This results in a skipped sample when the next batch
is processed.
