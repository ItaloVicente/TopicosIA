DESCRIPTION:

Remove legacy output-variables support from service tunnel

Before Scout 5.1 the service tunnel supported output-variables. These
are input arguments of type IHolder whose values are updated on the
backend. These values have been reflected on the client side by updating
the holders values to the ones from the backend. Using this mechanism it
was possible to return several values from a backend call comparable to
C# out arguments.
However this feature did no longer work since Scout 5.1. Furthermore it
is confusing and against the Java programming paradigms.
Therefore this feature is removed.
