DESCRIPTION:

Type version annotation: String -> Class<? extends ITypeVersion>

The type version of a data object is used to identify a certain structure version of the stored data object.
A data object may be stored in a database or be available as a container to export certain data for import in a different compatible system.
Such a data object may evolve over time and undergo structural changes.
Some structural changes make it necessary to apply migrations to existing data objects to comply with the new structure.

In order to prepare for migration support, the type version annotation so far containing a String value changes to a value of Class<? extends ITypeVersion>.
A ITypeVersion represents a namespace/version and it's dependencies.

EnumVersion was designed for migration support similar as the TypeVersion but was never part of any serialization output of a data object,
therefore couldn't be used as indicator for migrations.
Support for EnumVersion is removed.
