DESCRIPTION:

Hierarchical table: teach EventBuffer how to coalesce expanded events

A new table event TYPE_ROWS_EXPANDED has been introduced. This event is
required to send expansion events to the UI and back. The
TableEventBuffer must know how to handle and collect these events.
Otherwise expansion events are fired after all rows have been deleted
which leads to UI exceptions.
