DESCRIPTION:

Defer desktop-related data change events until desktop is in foreground

Typically, Scout applications fire data change events whenever a record
has been changed. Pages are the most common consumer of these events.
This change defers their notification if the page, or more specifically,
the desktop is not visible because it is covered by a view form.

There are however other elements interested in data change events which
do not accept deferred notification (e.g. a form listening on data
change events performed by another form which was opened by the first
one).

Therefore the desktop provides a new method
addDataChangeDesktopInForegroundListener used for deferred notification.
The behavior of the already existing method addDataChangeListener has
not changed and listeners added with it are notified immediately (or
immediately after multiple data changes have been performed, if
IDesktop.isDataChanging returns true).

Whether the desktop is in background is computed by the UI-layer and
cannot be manipulated by the client model (use
IDesktop.activateForm(null) to move the desktop to the foreground).
