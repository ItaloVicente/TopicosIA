DESCRIPTION:

TileGridLayout: preserve original overflow style after animation

After a tile was animated via _animateTileBounds, the tile container
always had the inline style "overflow: hidden" set, even if the CSS rule
does not specify this. This is not always desired (e.g. shadow is cut
off). The effect is caused by parallel running jQuery animations. To fix
it, the overflow style is restored manually after all animations have
been completed.
