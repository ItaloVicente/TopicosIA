DESCRIPTION:

Popup: Fix rendering of closing the popup

- Dispose inner widget after closing the popup. Otherwise the popup will
be empty in closing animation. The square used to show where popup is
anchored would also become visible.
- Fixed rendering in IE, where the popup would become visible again
after closing animation finishes. (this is not visible in other
browsers, since they are fast enough to remove the popup before it would
become visible again)
