DESCRIPTION:

SMTP Connection Pool: Fix sending email being slow when pool is active

The original implementation of the SmtpConnectionPool turned out to be
slow when using certain SMTP servers (e.g. exchange). The problem was
that SMTPTransport.isConnected() was being called after retrieving a
connection from the pool and before putting it back into the pool.
SMTPTransport.isConnected() uses the RSET or NOOP command which is
slowed down on certain SMTP servers to prevent DoS attacks. This added a
10 second penalty to each email being sent.

SMTPTransport.isConnected() has been completely removed from the
implementation. Instead, the following pattern was applied:
1. Connections retrieved from the pool are used to send an email without
any further checks.
2. If an exception occurs during the sending of the email one of the
following two things happens:
  a) the exception indicates a connection problem: the exception is
logged and a brand new connection is requested from the pool which is
used to try sending the email again. Any exception occuring during the
2nd try will be thrown and no further processing will take place.
  b) exceptions not indicating a connection problem will be thrown and
no further processing will take place.
3. If an exception occurs while sending an email, the connection will be
marked and, when released, not returned back to the pool.
