DESCRIPTION:

Fix sending email being slow when pool is active

The original implementation of the SmtpConnectionPool turned out to be
slow when using certain SMTP servers (e.g. exchange). The problem was
that SMTPTransport.isConnected() was being called after retrieving a
connection from the pool and before putting it back into the pool.
SMTPTransport.isConnected() uses the RSET or NOOP command which is
slowed down on certain SMTP servers to prevent DoS attacks. This added a
10 second penalty to each email being sent.

SMTPTransport.isConnected() has been completely removed from the
implementation. Instead, the following pattern was applied:
1. Connections retrieved from the pool are used to send an email without
any further checks.
2. If an exception occurs during the sending of the email one of the
following two things happens:
  a) the exception indicates a connection problem: the exception is
logged and a brand new connection is requested from the pool which is
used to try sending the email again. Any exception occuring during the
2nd try will be thrown and no further processing will take place.
  b) exceptions not indicating a connection problem will be thrown and
no further processing will take place.
3. If an exception occurs while sending an email, the connection will be
marked and, when released, not returned back to the pool.

Line:18, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mail/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mail/smtp/LeasedSmtpConnection.java -> - Change modifier to protected
- Add public getter. The second argument to releaseConnection is then no longer necessary, because the pool can just ask the leased connection if it failed or not.
- Maybe rename to m_failed, because isErrorOccurred() looks a bit strange?

Line:98, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mail/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mail/smtp/SmtpConnectionPool.java -> I think, if we would return here, the boolean variable retryWithFreshConnection would not be necessary?

Line:102, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mail/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mail/smtp/SmtpConnectionPool.java -> Can this message be phrased to be a bit more precise?

  "Sending message failed on first try due to a connection failure with the leased connection. Will retry with a new connection."

Line:132, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mail/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mail/smtp/SmtpConnectionPool.java -> Describe the new param in JavaDoc

Line:171, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mail/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mail/smtp/SmtpConnectionPool.java -> change required?

Line:245, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mail/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mail/smtp/SmtpConnectionPool.java -> See comment in LeasedSmtpConnection

Line:269, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mail/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mail/smtp/SmtpConnectionPool.java -> Maybe inline this variable entirely?

Line:98, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mail/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mail/smtp/SmtpConnectionPool.java -> You are right, I implemented it that way before and switched to the version with the variable for clarity reasons.
But I think if I add appropriate comments to the code the version without the variable would also be clear enough.
Sounds good?
