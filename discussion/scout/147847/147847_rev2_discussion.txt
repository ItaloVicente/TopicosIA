DESCRIPTION:

Desktop: prevent incorrect filtering of 'formActive' event

Problem:
When the UI server hides the current form and instead shows another
form, the handling of the "hide form" event causes a 'formActive=null'
event to be sent to the server (queued). When later the "show form"
event is processed, an event filter prevents that a second 'formActive'
event (with the new form as value) is sent to the server. As a
consequence, the UI server will no longer have the same state as the
browser.

Solution:
Before adding the event filter, DesktopAdapter needs to check if the
current request queue contains a 'formActivate' event. If yes, the event
filter must not be added.
