DESCRIPTION:

Fixed blocking of application server's cleanup thread

Stopping a client session might start new blocking forms. If the stop
request is issued by the UI (e.g. closing the browser or running into a
session timeout) there is no user who closes these forms.

This change does not allow starting forms, if the desktop is not open.
Further the SessionStore can cope with other kinds of blocking
operations, namely long running jobs that can be canceled and other long
running operations that neither check a cancel state nor do they running
into an interrupted check (i.e. no waiting operations).

Operations and situations that can be canceled or aborted do also
release the acquired memory. The other cases may cause memory leaks and
waste of CPU.
