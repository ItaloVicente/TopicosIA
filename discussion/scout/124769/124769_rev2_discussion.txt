DESCRIPTION:

DataModelConstant: TYPE_CODE_LIST merged with TYPE_NUMBER_LIST

TYPE_CODE_LIST and TYPE_NUMBER_LIST were originally intended to
separate Attributes of a FooBarCodeType from Attributes of a large
number space.

Since the application of this is of minor use, that separation has
ended.

TYPE_CODE_LIST and TYPE_NUMBER_LIST are merged to TYPE_LIST. TYPE_LIST
shares the id ordinal number with TYPE_NUMBER_LIST.

TYPE_CODE_TREE and TYPE_NUMBER_TREE are merged to TYPE_TREE. TYPE_TREE
shares the id ordinal number with TYPE_NUMBER_TREE.
