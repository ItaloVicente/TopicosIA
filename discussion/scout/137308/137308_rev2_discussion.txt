DESCRIPTION:

Uncaught Error: New range must not intersect with existing

When rendering a tree/table only the nodes/rows in the view range are
rendered to optimize performance. When the window size is increased only
the new appearing nodes should be rendered. It should never happen that
already existing nodes are re-rendered. In case the renderer detects
that the range of nodes to be rendered intersects the range of the
already rendered nodes an error is thrown.

This error still can occur even if no nodes are re-rendered: Let's
assume we have a large tree where only elements in the middle of the
tree are rendered (the tree is scrolled down). Now we decrease the
window size so that the tree is not visible anymore - no nodes are
rendered. When the window size is increased again the renderer detects
that the new view range contains the already rendered range and throws
the error, even though there were no rendered elements before.

Solution is to additionally check the size of the range of the already
rendered elements. In case there are no rendered elements the error
should not be thrown.
