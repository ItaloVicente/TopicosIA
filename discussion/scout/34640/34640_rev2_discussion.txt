DESCRIPTION:

Bug #446208: Missing visual marker for editable cells in RAP UI.

The fix is mainly done by externally patching RAP 'GridRow.js'. This is
necessary because there is no variant-support for individual table
cells. Alternatively, an additional HTML-element could be introduced to
wrap the cell's content. However, this causes some performance overhead
and a hack is still requird to reset the cell's padding because being
calculated directly into the absolute cell position.
