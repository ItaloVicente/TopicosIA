DESCRIPTION:

StringField: allow container to scroll when end of scrollarea is reached

Currently, when scrolling in a multiline string field, the container will never scroll (at least with Firefox, with Chrome and Edge they will because of the hybrid scrolling, see scrollbars.js). This is consistent to how other fields behave. But the string field is the only scrollable field which is used in an editable table. In that case it can be quite confusing that the table itself will never scroll when using the mousewheel over the edited (multiline) cell.

The browser itself handles it in a different way: if the end of the scroll area is reached (top or bottom), the outer scrollables will scroll. In order to solve the issue with the table the same behavior has now been implemented for StringFields.

Other fields still behave as before, but it is to discuss if all scrollables (=Scrollbar.js) should be changed as well.
