DESCRIPTION:

Data objects: add support for DO entity contributions

DO entity contributions allow to add payload in form of a specific DO
entity to an existing DO entity. The payload is part of an internal
attribute node _contributions. The contributions are designed in a way
that it is known which contribution are applicable to which DO entities
in order to determine a list of DO entities that can be held within
another DO entity.
