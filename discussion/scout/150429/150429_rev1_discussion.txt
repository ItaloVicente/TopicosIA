DESCRIPTION:

SmtpConnectionPool: Fix locking problems with broken connections

With the removal of the isConnected() check, a locking problem was
introduced, that could lead to several threads waiting for "new"
connections but not being able to get any because the pool is already
filled with idle connections (which were all newly created).

The mechanism for the "retry if potential connection problem with
connection from the pool was detected" case was changed so that now, in
exactly this case, a new exchangeConnection() method will be called that
releases the provided (broken) connection (i.e. makes room in the pool)
and then immediately creates a new one that is returned. This newly
created connection is then used to perform the second try to send the
message.
