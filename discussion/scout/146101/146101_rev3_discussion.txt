DESCRIPTION:

Widget: getWidgetByClass should find replaced widgets

A widget can be replaced using the annotation @Replace. GetWidgetByClass
does not find replaced widgets when looking for the super class.

It works for form fields because AbstractCompositeField has a map of all
form field replacements. This map is actually only necessary for a very
rare case which we do not want to support for other widgets than form
fields.

In order to support @Replace for non form fields, the AbstractWidget
does a simple instanceof check (like the ActionFinder already does) and
the special handling is now only executed by AbstractFormField and
AbstractCompositeField.
