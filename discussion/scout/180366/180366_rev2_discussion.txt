DESCRIPTION:

DesktopNavigation: adjust size of ViewButtonBox in single view mode

In "single view button" mode, the navigation is positioned at the very
top, at the same location as the ViewButtonBox. This looks correct
(ViewButtonBox is transparent), but the outline title cannot be clicked
anymore since the mouse events are blocked by the ViewButtonBox.

To fix this issue, the view button box must be resized to its preferred
size when in "single view button" mode.
