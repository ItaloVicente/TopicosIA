Line:68, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/ui/html/json/desktop/JsonDesktop.java -> Why is this called "loadStartup" while the corresponding model operation is called "activateDefaultView"? If there is no good reason, I would prefer a consistent naming.

Line:24, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/DesktopLogo.js -> In case the application does not have a reasonable default view or the logo should not be clickable, it should be possible to disable this behavior (default implementation of execDefaultView() is empty). Because the DesktopLogo does not exist on the Java model, it should probably be a property on the IDesktop.

How about decoupling the this action entirely from the "activate default view" behaviour?

* Click sends "desktopLogoAction" event to the UI server
* UI server executes "execDesktopAction()". The AbstractDesktop calls activateDefaultView() by default, but this could be changed by the project.
* Property would be called "getConfiguredDesktopLogoActionEnabled" or similar.

Line:47, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/DesktopLogo.js -> Only DOM properties (usually starting with $) should be created or destroyed in the render()/remove() phase. During a widget's life cycle it might be removed and rendered again multiple times. Because this.desktop is a model property, it should not be unset during remove().

Line:11, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/DesktopLogo.less -> If a proeprty is implemented, this has to be moved to a separate class (e.g. ".clickable")
