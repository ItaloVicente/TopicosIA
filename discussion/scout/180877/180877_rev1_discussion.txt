Line:78, eclipse-scout-core/src/desktop/outline/pages/Page.js -> is this only necessary for scout classic, resp. if the detailForm is an id or a Widget? Maybe add a comment

Line:84, eclipse-scout-core/src/desktop/outline/pages/Page.js -> We don't work with the String class, so the instanceof check should not be necessary.

Line:117, eclipse-scout-core/src/desktop/outline/pages/Page.js -> We use the word trigger instead of fire in Scout JS.

Also, the event names are normally a noun or infinitive (e.g. propertyChange instead of propertyChanged, click instead of clicked). But actually I am not sure if we really need a custom event. I think we could just make the detailForm and detailTable to a property which makes it possible to listen for propertyChange:detailForm.

Is there a reason why you added a the method onDetailTableCreated? Isn't it possible to just override _initDetailTable instead? I think this would be more consistent because the regular initialization is normally done by overriding _init(model)

Line:212, eclipse-scout-core/src/desktop/outline/pages/Page.js -> I am not sure if we should use AnyWidget here because it is a Form and not any other widget.

Line:42, eclipse-scout-core/test/desktop/outline/pages/PageSpec.js -> comment seems to be wrong, they are not created lazily on page activation, they are initialized during init
