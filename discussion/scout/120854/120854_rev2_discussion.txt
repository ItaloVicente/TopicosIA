DESCRIPTION:

Multiple delete events of nested tree nodes cause UIException

TreeEventBuffer did not handle multiple delete events of nested
TreeNodes correctly. Since the TreeNodes references to its childs /
parents are deleted before the EventBuffer handles the delete events we
need to handle the parent TreeNode of each event manually by remembering
the TreeNode structure separately 207681

Backport from 6.1.x to 6.0.x.
