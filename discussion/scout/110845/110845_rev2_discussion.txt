DESCRIPTION:

Fix logging of cancelled client jobs due to session shutdown

All client jobs assigned to a particular session are canceled when the
session is shutting down. The affected jobs query did not restrict the
job state, so that completed jobs might be returned as well (the
FutureSet that manages all running jobs references DONE jobs as well, at
least for a _small_ amount of time). Excluding DONE and REJECTED jobs
prevents logging of false-positives.
