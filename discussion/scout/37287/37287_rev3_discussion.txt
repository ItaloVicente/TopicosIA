DESCRIPTION:

Bug 453504 - SWT: Nullpointer when toggling a checkable table-cell
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=453504

The problem was based that a traversal event was fired the time the
cell-editor was focused. As having no focusable control at all and being
closed immediately, that resulted in accessing a 'null' cell-editor
reference.
Furthermore, simplified the usage of cell-editors by using JFace editing
support with a separate cell-editor for each cell.
