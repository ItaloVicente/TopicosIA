DESCRIPTION:

Tooltip: Fix "jumping" on text change

When a tooltip gets rendered, it is done in two phases: first the
container is rendered at top:0/left:0. Second in postRender the actual
width and height of the tooltip get measured  and based on that
dimensions the tooltip gets positioned besides its $anchor-element.

When the text of a tooltip changes those two phases where executed
again. But the tooltip is not at the top-left corner again, which can
lead to a line break in the first phase. In the second phase the tooltip
gets repositioned, which can lead to the loss of the line break of phase
1. When this happens, the tooltip has a false height which means also
false positioning.

In order to fix that, the tooltip will be positioned at top:0/left:0
before re-rendering in those two phases.
