DESCRIPTION:

437268: [RAP] Different Display Error Message in Log 
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=437268

Bugfix that closing the desktop due to httpSession invalidation or
userAgent switch was not run on behalf of the Scout model thread but on
the calling thread instead.

Consequences:

(1) The client session was not closed at all because of an early dropout
which was caused due to an unhandled IllegalStateException when queuing
into the UIThread.

(2) When switching the userAgent, the cleanup was run on behalf of the
new UIThread with its own Display registered. In turn, the Display of
the current Thread differed from the one registered within the
environment.
