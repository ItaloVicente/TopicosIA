DESCRIPTION:

Fixed problem with unstable Selenium test.

The test failed apparently random. In the case of a failure the value
selected in the cell-editor was not set on the model. Detailed analysis
showed that in the good case the UI sent in the same HTTP request the
following events:
- completeCellEdit
- click (Close button of the dialog)

In the case of a failure the order of the events is switched because
CellEditorPopup.js#completeEdit recognizes that the Promise returned by
acceptInput is still running. Thus the click comes first. Because of
that on the UI server the form is closed first. When the
completeCellEdit event is processed later, the adapter does not exist
anymore and value is ignored, even though the SmartField used as cell
editor has the correct value.

The solution is to call completeCellEdit in
AbstractTableField#validateContent to make sure the value from the cell
editor is applied when a form is closed.

SeleniumDriver: added method to simulate slow network with
chrome-driver.

Use change from Claudio in order to call completeCellEdit via API:
