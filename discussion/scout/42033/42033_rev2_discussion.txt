DESCRIPTION:

Added ITreeNode.isInitializing() to suppress some events during init

While initializing a tree node (or outline page), tree events should not
be fired, because this might lead to wrong/unnecessary event ("update
event before insert event" issue).

Additionally, some code in Tree/Table was harmonized.
