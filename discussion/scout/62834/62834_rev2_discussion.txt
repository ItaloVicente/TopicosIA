DESCRIPTION:

JAX-WS: Fix authentication issue in one-way communication

Problem:
JAX-WS Metro RI v2.2.10 does not exit the call chain if the ongoing request is a one-way communication and AuthHandler returns with 'false'. That results in that the endpoint operation is still invoked.

Solution:
Throw HTTPException with respective HTTP status code instead.

Note:
This issue was already addressed in JAX-WS Scout with Metro RI v2.1.6, but the support to identify one-way-operations was removed in a later Metro version. [currentVersion=v.2.2.10]
