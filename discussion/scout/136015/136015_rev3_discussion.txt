DESCRIPTION:

If tree was manually expanded it should not be collapsed by lazy-expand

When a tree is lazy-expanded only the relevant nodes are displayed. When
a node becomes irrelevant it is automatically collapsed. Currently this
can also collapse nodes that are manually expanded by the user.

This commit changes the tree behavior so that nodes that are manually
expanded by the user are not affected anymore by the
lazy-expand feature until it is manually collapsed again by the user.
