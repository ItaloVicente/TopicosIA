DESCRIPTION:

Allow the calendar to inject its context menus into a group box menubar

The existing logic, which inserts the menu object references from the
calendar context menu into the group box context menu creates two ui
adapters which will react on each other. When a submenu tree in the
calendar context menu needs to be expanded, the calendar context menu
will be closed by the group box menu.
=> To prevent this from happening a new property on the calendar is
   introduced: "PROP_MENU_INJECTION_TARGET". With this property the
   group box which should render the calendar menus can be specified.
=> The menus will be injected to the group box menubar inside the ui
   layer. At this point, the menus will behave like ordinary menus and
   sub menu trees can be expanded within the calendars context menu.
