DESCRIPTION:

Fix BenchRowLayoutData

The rows array must be initialized before the super constructor is
executed. The bug was introduced in commit
82967544e058ec9239f16ca78de2638ade3b5dd5 (Execute constructor super call
first). To solve the problem the parent class defines a prepare method
which is executed as the first instruction in the constructor. This
method may be overridden by child classes to execute code before the
parent constructors instructions are running.
At the same time the constructor super call of the child class is still
the first expression as required by ES6.
