DESCRIPTION:

Remove problematic IBlockingCondition.waitForUninterruptibly

The method IBlockingCondition.waitForUninterruptibly was introduced
before ModelJobs.EXECUTION_HINT_UI_INTERACTION_REQUIRED and was intended
to make calls to waitFor (using a blocking condition) insensitive to
user cancellation.

Since ModelJobs.EXECUTION_HINT_UI_INTERACTION_REQUIRED a user
cancellation cancels all model jobs except those with that hint.

Therefore IBlockingCondition.waitForUninterruptibly is not only
obsolete, it is problematic due to its behaviour of swallowing
InterruptedExceptions.

In addition changed behaviour of AbstractDesktop.closeInternal by
separating code into more finegrained internal methods.
Session/Desktop close has the phases:
- hide registered forms
- interrupt blocking condition
- close messageboxes, filechoosers, forms
- close desktop extensions
- interrupt blocking condition (new occurrences)
- close messageboxes, filechoosers (new occurrences)
