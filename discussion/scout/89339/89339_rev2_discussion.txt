DESCRIPTION:

IDeviceTransformer: add transformPageTable() to transform the page table

Transforming the page table during transformPage() emits a warning by
AbstractPage, because the table should not be initialized during the
page's "execInitPage" phase. To resolve this issue, a new method
transformPageTable() was added that is called during the pages'
"execInitTable" phase.

To avoid confusion and to clearify that those methods may be called
multiple times, the methods transformPageDetailForm() and
transformPageDetailTable() were renamed to notifyPageDetailFormChanged()
and notifyPageDetailTableChanged().
