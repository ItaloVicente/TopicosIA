DESCRIPTION:

Scout apache http client with retryPost=true

The default enabling of retryPost has the negative performance effect
that all ui-initiated cancel of outline queries leads to the correct
cancel of the server database query but in response triggers a apache
http-retry of the POST request. This second post request again executes
the outline query but is not cancellable anymore since the ui already
detached from this back-end call.

Setting default post-retry to false is also the default-safe way to
handle http post requests.
