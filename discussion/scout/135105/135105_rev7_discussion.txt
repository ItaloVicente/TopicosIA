DESCRIPTION:

Table: Selection lost after reloading with an active UserTableRowFilter

On reloading a table with active row filter the row selection is lost.
This happens due to outdated user row filters. The user row filters do
not accept the new inserted rows, therefore they will be unselected.

Solution is to remove the user row filters when all rows are deleted.
When the new rows will be added they will now be accepted by the
filters. After the rows have been inserted by the browser the user
filters are applied again and synchronized back to the server.
