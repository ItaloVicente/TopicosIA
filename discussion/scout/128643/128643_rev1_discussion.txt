DESCRIPTION:

Prevent cache pollution

The GlobalHttpResourceCache is responsible for holding the responses for
valid resource requests (like html, js, css, etc.). As key of the cache
map the path of the resource is used. Such a path may contain a
hex-fingerprint that acts like a version of the file so that it may be
cached by user agents for a very long time because the filename wont
change as long as the content wont change.
Therefore it was possible to request a valid resource (like an existing
css file) with various fingerprints. The server ignored the requested
fingerprint and always found the corresponding resource and returned the
content to the client.
Furthermore the resource was cached on the server so that future
requests to the same resource must not process the file again. This
results in the situation that the same resource is cached again with the
newly requested fingerprint. Using this it was easily possible to bring
the server to memory limit by requesting the same resource with lots of
different fingerprints (cache pollution).
Now the server only returns a response (and therefore also only caches
the result) if the requested fingerprint actually matches the content of
the response. So requests having an invalid fingerprint will no longer
get a valid response but a not-found status instead.
This better complies with the idea of a resource request and keeps the
cache clean.
On the other hand it is still possible to increase the workload on the
server by sending lots of requests with wrong fingerprints because the
server tries to find the resource, loads its content, creates the
fingerprint, compares it with the request and rejects the response
because of a mismatch. An other alternative would be to also answer
requests with wrong fingerprints with the correct response, but exclude
the fingerprint from the resource cache key. But for now this is not
implemented because a wrong fingerprint should not get a valid response.
