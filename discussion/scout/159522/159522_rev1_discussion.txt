Line:21, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/DesktopResourceHelper.java -> This should be @ApplicationScoped. We don't need a new instance everytime we call BEANS.get()

Line:22, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/DesktopResourceHelper.java -> I think this name is misleading. What is a "desktop resource"? Is "handler" appropriate here? (It does not seem to handle the resources, just converts them to a suitable OpenUriAction.)

How about "BinaryResourceOpenUriHelper" or just "OpenUriHelper"?

Line:23, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/DesktopResourceHelper.java -> This class (and/or the main method) requires some short JavaDoc.

Line:24, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/DesktopResourceHelper.java -> This should return IOpenUriAction instead of OpenUriAction (since openUri() on the desktop also takes this as an argument).

This comment applies to the entire class.

Line:53, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/DesktopResourceHelper.java -> How about moving this null check to the main method? It would not have to be repeated for every "isX" method.

Line:114, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/DesktopResourceHelper.java -> Did you test this? Doesn't that replace the application (since browsers can natively display SVGs).

How is SVG different from "images"?

Line:682, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/IDesktop.java -> I would mention here that the openUriAction is automatically selected (as opposed to openUri(BinaryResource, IOpenUriAction)).
