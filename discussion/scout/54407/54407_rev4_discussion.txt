Line:52, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/services/common/code/CodeServiceClientProxy.java -> Previously it was used after receiving a client notification. It could potentially be a problem in a project using scout. Just add it to the release notes.

Line:67, org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.test/src/test/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/server/cache/AbstractTransactionalMapTest.java -> it's better to create multiple smaller test cases, that way it is much easier to see the problem, if the test fails.

Line:38, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/AbstractCacheWrapper.java -> why this empty method? if anything needs to be done in subclass, a method with @PostConstruct could be added

Line:131, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/BasicCache.java -> this is dangerous, if the classes AllCacheEntryFilter or KeyCacheEntryFilter are extended.
I guess, this is a performance optimization, if it is really needed, then please make the classes final.

Line:152, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/BasicCache.java -> unused in Scout, needed here?

Line:12, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/ICache.java -> functional interface?

Line:18, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/ICache.java -> better to throw exceptions

Line:26, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/IRemoteCacheService.java -> add @ApplicationScoped, remove extends IService

Line:88, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/services/common/code/AbstractSharedCodeService.java -> - partitioned API is not needed?
- it would be nice, if CodeTypes could be accessed like any other beans: no newInstance calls, use cache as a provider for the actual instances

Line:252, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/services/common/code/AbstractSharedCodeService.java -> it's better to return an empty set, no nullcheck needed for users, should be described in javadoc

Line:292, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/services/common/code/AbstractSharedCodeService.java -> Hidden Magic: It is assumed that there is a partitionid in the sharedVariable map, if partitions are needed.
Better: Put the partitionid on the session interface with a reasonnable default.

Line:50, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/services/common/code/CodeTypeCacheKey.java -> use org.eclipse.scout.commons.ToStringBuilder

Line:38, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/AbstractCacheWrapper.java -> Done

Line:131, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/BasicCache.java -> Yes, the instanceof is only required because of a performance optimization. Thanks for the good point of making these special filter classes final.

Line:152, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/BasicCache.java -> I added this method to the interface to allow a custom cache wrapper to have additional functionality that can be accessed from outside. E.g. a counter. Then ICache#getComponent(MyCounter.class) could retrun such an object and the values in the counter could be accessed without knowing any of the structure of the cache.
There is currenlty a second option to access such an internal object in a wrapper. One could create the MyCounter object before creating the cache and hold that reference to that MyCounter object externally (ICacheBuilder#withAdditionalCustomWrapper).
getComponent is just a bit more flexible and like IPage#getAdapter. I can remove it if you belive this is not required and extends the interface too much.

Line:12, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/ICache.java -> ICacheValueResolver would be an functional interface if the default implementation in AbstractCacheValueResolver could be implemented directly in the interface definition (java 1.8).

Line:18, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/ICache.java -> Then what about BasicCache:114? Then this method should rethrow the exception? And therefore also the getter interface methods should throw ProcessingExceptions. But CodeTypeCache.getCodeType(Class<T>) does catch also the exceptions. When the exception handling is ok how it is currently done, then null values should also not throw exceptions. I decided to ignore also null keys. As if null values are ok then code like the following can be avoided:

if(key!=null){
 value=getCache().get(key);
 if(value!=null){
  //do something
 }
}

Only the value null check is required.

Line:26, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/IRemoteCacheService.java -> Done

Line:252, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/services/common/code/AbstractSharedCodeService.java -> Done

Line:292, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/services/common/code/AbstractSharedCodeService.java -> Just merged org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.services.common.code.CodeService#provideCurrentPartitionId into the base implementation of AbstractSharedCodeService

Line:50, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/services/common/code/CodeTypeCacheKey.java -> Done

Line:152, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/BasicCache.java -> In this case maybe use IAdaptable interface?

Line:12, org.eclipse.scout.rt.shared/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/shared/cache/ICache.java -> ok
