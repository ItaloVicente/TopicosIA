DESCRIPTION:

Tree: fix node collapsing when "lazy" flag is not set explicitly

Commit 776caa5879ed38be63fc0a3f3305fe7c9e5e0a27 introduced a changed
behavior of setNodeExpanded(false) when the "lazy" flag was not
explicitly set. Instead of collapsing the node, it simply did nothing
when the node had the "lazyExpandingEnabled" flag set and the node was
currently expanded and not expandedLazy. This has undesired effects
(e.g. when trying to restore the initial expansion state for the entire
tree or collapsing all nodes) and is therefore revered.

Instead, the method was changed that it only applies lazy expansion
during the state change "collapsed -> expanded" but not the other way
round. If the new expanded state is equal to the old state, the "lazy
expansion" state should also stay equal.
