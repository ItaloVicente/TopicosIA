DESCRIPTION:

Cancel job before canceling the associated RunMonitor

This is crucial, as otherwise the interrupted thread may terminate the task's execution even if the job is cancelled. That is because interruption is done by the context's monitor.

However, Java FutureTask cancels the job without interrupting its executing thread (even if requested). That is done later by RunContext, or JobFutureTask if not specified. That ensures proper monitor and future state once the thread is finally interrupted.
