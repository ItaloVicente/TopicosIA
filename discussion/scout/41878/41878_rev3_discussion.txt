DESCRIPTION:

Replace Eclipse Jobs used in Scout applications with an alternative
implementation based on pure Java
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=458143

This refactoring is done on behalf of removing the dependency to OSGi
and Eclipse in the transition to Scout v5.

---
This commit continues work done in commit
430c72ce3f10a64f24b2a0d4a2589f4675947620 and provides mainly a
replacement for ServerJobs.

Also, the following was revisited:
- job exception handling;
- interception of Callables given to the JobManager;
- ThreadLocals which are defined directly on the representing objects;
