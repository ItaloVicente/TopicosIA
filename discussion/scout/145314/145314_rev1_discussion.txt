DESCRIPTION:

Revert "If tree was manually expanded it should not be collapsed by
lazy-expand"

This reverts commit 00a42f6e95cddae871e29fbef2cad4d1dbb01755.

That change attempted to fix an issue with vanishing tree nodes in some
special cases where nested pages with lazy expansion enabled received
DataChangeEvents and were wrongly collapsed. However, this introduced
new, more severe bugs in the tree. For example, the restoration of the
initial expansion state by clicking on the outline title did no longer
work.

To fix the new issues, the commit is reverted with this change. This
will restore the original bug, but since it was only apparent in very
special cases, we consider this the better alternative.

The problem will be properly fixed in Scout 8.0.
