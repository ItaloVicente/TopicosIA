DESCRIPTION:

Introduce propertyChange Event for HtmlEnvironment / Dense Mode

With this change it's possible to change the HtmlEnvironment's
properties at runtime. The HtmlEnvironment fires a propertyChange event.
Every layout that depends on these properties should listen for this
propertyChange, and reinitialize their internal state as well as
invalidate the corresponding widget's layout tree.

Add new Desktop.DisplayStyle.DENSE and corresponding styling for more
content on your screen.
