DESCRIPTION:

Move bean related methods from TestingUtility to Platform as
BeanTestingHelper

Functionality for (un-)registering beans is required for platform tests
too, thus moving bean related methods from TestingUtility to platform as
BeanTestingHelper. SharedBeanTestingHelper is required to keep the
behavior of removing
TunnelToServer annotation when registering beans in shared (not
available in platform).

No deprecation annotations yet with 8.0 release. Bean related methods in
TestingUtility will be deprecated in the next release.
clearHttpAuthenticationCache will be removed without replacement.
