DESCRIPTION:

Use DelayedExecutor for delayed and repetitive execution

When having more than 10'000 jobs scheduled simultaneously, Quartz Scheduler does no longer perform as expected due to the many misfirings, which cause a high rate of scheduler lock contention.

Still, trigger mechanism, schedule plans and firing computation facility is provided by Quartz Scheduler.
