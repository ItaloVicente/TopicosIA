DESCRIPTION:

DuplicateRequestException on very high load

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=553043

When running a system under
- very high server load (http consumer backlog delays of up to more than
1 minute)
- high client activity (more than 25 requests per http session per
second)

then false DuplicateRequestException can occur.
This is because the ServiceTunnelServlet uses a sequence detector with
default size of 25 and maxAge of 1 minute.
Thus the window size is insufficient under that load.

A solution can be to increase the window size in the project that has
such load.

However, after many years now this (old) default settings are changed
now since modern web apps use more and more small requests to improve
and extend responsive UIs.

For better customization private member fields are now protected.

The constants names of the session objects are strings for better code
understanding.
