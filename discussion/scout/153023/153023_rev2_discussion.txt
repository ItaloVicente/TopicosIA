DESCRIPTION:

ClientCacheBuilder: Ensure that the client cache is not transactional

Although scout ui jobs have a transaction, the caching should not done
transactionally. Most caches rely on data provided by the server, where
transactional behavior is important. Usually, when the ui cache is
notified, the server transaction has already committed.
