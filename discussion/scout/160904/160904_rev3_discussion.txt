DESCRIPTION:

Remove eclipse-scout-releng from default pnpm workspace and maven build

The release life-cycle of eclipse-scout-releng is independent of other
scout modules. It is not built or released together with other modules
as eclipse-scout-releng is used as a built tool and not during runtime.
