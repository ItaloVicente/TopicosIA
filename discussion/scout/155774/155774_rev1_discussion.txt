DESCRIPTION:

Improve productive JS stack traces

If an error occurs on a productive system, it is very hard to analyze
it because the stack trace points to the minified code.
This is actually nothing new, but because of the babel transformation,
not even the method names are readable now.

To improve it, source maps are now generated in prod mode, too, but
with important differences to the ones generated in dev mode:
1. They are generated as separate files to not bloat the actual source
files -> they are only requested when the browser's dev tools are
open.
2. They contain no source code which is especially important in a
closed source project.
3. The sources array doesn't point to the real files to prevent
revealing the absolute paths (security).

In addition, the error logging has been improved so that the browser
can correctly apply the source maps.
