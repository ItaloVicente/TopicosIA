DESCRIPTION:

Potential interrupt of not owned Thread

JobFutureTask.run does not synchronize on the leased Thread in its try
finally section. A potential race condition can occur when another
Thread calls JobFutureTask.interrupt. The local variable used to cache
the volatile value may still be set after run() sets the Thread member
field to null. The Thread may now be running another task and is then
accidentially interrupted.

The fix uses safe AtomicReference<Thread> with a synchronize-on-use
contract.
