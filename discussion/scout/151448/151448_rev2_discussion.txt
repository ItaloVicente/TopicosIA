DESCRIPTION:

Potential interrupt of not owned Thread

JobFutureTask.run does not synchronize on the leased Thread in its try
finally section. A potential race condition can occur when another
Thread calls JobFutureTask.interrupt. The local variable used to cache
the volatile value may still be set after run() sets the Thread member
field to null. The Thread may now be running another task and is then
accidentially interrupted.

The fix uses safe AtomicReference<Thread> with a synchronize-on-use
contract.

The change will work, but its a bit overdone: The newly introduced AtomicReference has no advantages over the original volatile field, that already provides atomic read or writes (but not atomic read AND write, which is not required here). I suggest to return to the original volatile field and synchronize using 'this' (i.e. the JobFuturueTask instance).
Line:102, org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/platform/job/internal/JobFutureTask.java -> AtomicReference is a bit an overkill because its CAS-capabilities are not required and critical access must be synchronized anyway. The original volatile variable and synchronization on 'this' JobFutureTask instance is completely sufficient here.

Line:168, org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/platform/job/internal/JobFutureTask.java -> Synchronization at this point is not required because the cancelled method reads and volatile field into a local variable (either becuase you replace the AtomicReference with the original volatile variable as suggested above or because the wrapped AtomicReference is stored in a volatile field as well). Due to volatile, the read in cancelled is atomic. So either the m_leasedThread has ben set or not. Synchornization does not change anything.

Line:624, org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/platform/job/internal/JobFutureTask.java -> At this point, too, an AtomicReference does not bring any added value compared to a volatile variable.

I agree with Andi: Remove the AtomicRef as it brings no added value here.

Line:102, org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/platform/job/internal/JobFutureTask.java -> partially agree.
The use of a volatile Thread is ok.
However, using synchronize(this) is not a safe solution as the JobFutureTask itself is the IFuture. This IFuture could be locked by a third thread which then blocks the second thread in the cancel call. This is a potential deadlock.

Line:168, org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/platform/job/internal/JobFutureTask.java -> Done

Line:624, org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/platform/job/internal/JobFutureTask.java -> Done
