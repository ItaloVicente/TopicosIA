DESCRIPTION:

TableHeader: prevent errors in event handlers when not rendered anymore

Event handlers are called asynchronously, which means that they cannot
assume the same state as when they were registered. In some rare cases,
the table header was removed in the mean time, which causes JS errors
when not handled appropriately. Fix: the event handlers should check
before they access values that are only available in rendered state.
