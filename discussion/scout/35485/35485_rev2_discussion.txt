DESCRIPTION:

Bug 448743: RAP [tablet/mobile]: Wrong CSS-styling for date and time
fields.

Changed the CSS class assignement (RAP variant) for Scout fields so that
the different fields can be styled independently of the other fields.
That enables custom styling e.g. for only date/time fields in
mobile/tablet UI.

The problem was based on the introduction of a global variant for Scout
value fields (commit 09b92f889b33c5b551bff35bfdab25fd2b0ead8f) which was
not set for mobile/table UI widgets. However, that change was reverted
to enable custom per-field styling.
