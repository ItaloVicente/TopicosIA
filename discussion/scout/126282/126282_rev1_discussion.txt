DESCRIPTION:

TuningUtility: Use separate timer stack per thread, fix concurrency

Previously, using the TuningUtility simultaneously from multiple threads
would result in NullPointerExceptions, NoSuchElementExceptions, and
misleading or missing measurements.

This change adds:

- The use of a separate timer stack per thread. It is now possible to
use TuningUtility in methods that run concurrently in separate threads
(e.g. user sessions).
- A list containing the timer stacks for all threads, needed to clear
unfinished timers in finishAll. This list uses WeakReferences to prevent
hard references on ThreadLocal values.

The added overhead will not affect measurements:

- Initialization of ThreadLocals is done at most once per thread, and
this happens before the first call to System.nanoTime() in any given
thread, i.e. this will not affect any measurements.
- Cleanup of WeakReferences happens during the initialization of a
ThreadLocal and will thus not affect any measurements.
- The synchronize blocks in start/stop synchronize on the ThreadLocal
value, i.e. there is no global lock. There is never lock contention
unless finishAll is called.
