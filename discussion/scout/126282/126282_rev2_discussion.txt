DESCRIPTION:

TuningUtility: Use separate timer per thread

Previously, using the TuningUtility simultaneously from multiple threads
would result in NullPointerExceptions, NoSuchElementExceptions, and
misleading or missing measurements.

This change adds:

- The use of a separate timer stack per thread. It is now possible to
use TuningUtility in methods that run concurrently in multiple threads
(e.g. user sessions).
- A list containing the timer stacks for all threads, needed to clear
unfinished timers in finishAll. This list uses WeakReferences to prevent
hard references on ThreadLocal values.

The added overhead should not significantly affect measurements:

- Initialization of ThreadLocals is done at most once per thread, and
this happens before the first call to System.nanoTime() in any given
thread.
- Removal of WeakReferences happens at the same time, and only then.
- The synchronize blocks in start/stop synchronize on the ThreadLocal
timer stack, i.e. there is no global lock for start/stop. There is no
lock contention unless finishAll is called.
