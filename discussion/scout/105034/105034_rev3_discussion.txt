DESCRIPTION:

Fix bug where TreeAdapter supplied invalid defaults when checking nodes

Previously, when checking nodes, the adapter would implicitly let the
tree itself decide if a node's children should also be checked. That led
to the problem that nodes kept unchecking each other when recursively
(un)checking nodes in order of their child-to-parent relationship. This
scenario was obscure, but possible.
