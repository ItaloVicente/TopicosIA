DESCRIPTION:

Multiple delete events of nested tree nodes cause UIException

TreeEventBuffer did not handle multiple delete events of nested
TreeNodes correctly. Since the TreeNodes references to its childs /
parents are deleted before the EventBuffer handles the delete events we
need to handle the parent TreeNode of each event manually by remembering
the TreeNode structure separately 207681
