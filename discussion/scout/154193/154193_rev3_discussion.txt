DESCRIPTION:

Table: Missing rows when using row and UI filter

Rows of a table can be filtered by row filters in the model and user row
filters in the UI. When they are combined and a row filter in the model
is removed additional rows may become visible that are not existing in
the UI yet thus not existing in the list of rows accepted by the user
row filter in the UI.

Solution is to also remove the user row filters when a row filter in the
model is removed. All available rows will be synchronized to the UI. The
UI will reapply the user row filters any sync them back to the model.
