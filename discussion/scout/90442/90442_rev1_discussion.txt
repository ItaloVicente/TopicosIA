DESCRIPTION:

JsonForm: Don't attach child adapters until form is initialized

Observed behavior: A form inside a AbstractFormMenu with fields that are
set to visibleGranted=false during execInitField() caused UI errors when
property changes happened on that field: "Could not resolve event
targets"

Analysis has shown that the field adapters are created and sent to the
UI (although they should not), because during attachChildAdapters() the
form is not yet started, and therefore the execInitField() methods have
not been executed yet. When the parent group box's toJson() method is
called, another DisplayableFormFieldFilter is applied and this time, the
visibleGranted property has to correct value. Therefore, the adapters
are sent to the UI (and listeners are attached), but they are not be
connected to any other adapters. Therefore, they will not be created on
the UI and events that happen later will not find their target.

To fix the problem (not only in the AbstractFormMenu case, but also in
AbstractTableControl, and maybe at other places), the JsonForm postpones
the execution of attachChildAdapters() until the "Form Initialized"
event is fired. At this point, the execInitField() methods of the inner
fields are guaranteed to have been run.
