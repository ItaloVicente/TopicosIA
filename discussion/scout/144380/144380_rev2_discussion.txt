DESCRIPTION:

Scrollbar: ensure 'position' of parent element is set only when attached

Scrollbars require a position of 'absolute' or 'relative'. Sometimes
this is explicitly set by CSS rules. For all other cases, the required
position value is ensured during installation of the scrollbars.
However, install() is sometimes called when the container is currently
detached from the DOM. In this situation, querying the current
'position' will return an empty string (because the CSS rules are not
effective in detached state). Assuming that the position has to be
manually overridden is wrong is those cases and can cause layouting
errors. Instead, the scrollbar must wait until they are attached again
and then check the parent position.

The corresponding code was moved from scrollbars.js to Scrollbar.js,
because Scrollbar is a widget and can participate in the 'attach' life
cycle. Is is either checked during _render or during _afterAttach.

Added Spec.
