DESCRIPTION:

Erratic scrolling behaviour for Tree with anchor scrolling in Chrome.

With the new introduced anchor scrolling feature, large trees start some
sort of life of its own (large trees: at least a few thousand rows).
After scrolling down for about 10 percent of the rows (in one step), the
browser triggers many extra scroll events and the tree gets (auto)
scrolled down all the way to the bottom. Disable anchor scrolling for
our tree for now, it will decide the correct scroll positions itself.
