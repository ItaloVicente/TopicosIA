DESCRIPTION:

ThreadInterrupted, TimedOut & FutureCancelledEx are now PlatofromErrors

There were circumstances where the cancellation of long-running actions
did not work or lead to unpleasant behaviors. Most of time caught
exceptions where the reason for such behaviors. In order to get rid of
those problems, we have decided that the former RuntimeExceptions will
become Errors and therefore should no longer be swallowed by
"catch(RuntimeException e)". See "Technical Guide" for more information,
184111.
Patchsets:
1) Added new InterruptionErrors instead of PlatformExceptions
2) Replaced InterruptionExceptions by InterruptionErrors
3) Add PlatformErrors to Catch-Block where RuntimeException get catched
4) Changes after feedback from ABR/DWI
5) Re-added catch of FutureCancelledError in HttpServiceTunnel
