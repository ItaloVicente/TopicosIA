DESCRIPTION:

Increase performance of not application scoped beans instantiation

Creation of beans like IDoEntity which have to be created at each call
to BEANS#get were expensive.

 - BeanInstanceUtil#createBean now respects injection constructors too
 - Introduce BeanInstanceUtil#beanInstanceCreator to cache reflection
   data
 - Moved circular dependencies detection from
     DefaultBeanInstanceProducer#safeCreateInstance
   to
     BeanInstanceUtil#createAndAssertNoCircularDependency
 - Use cached ArrayDeque instance for INSTANTIATION_STACK ThreadLocale
 - Split DefaultBeanInstanceProducer into
     NonSingeltonBeanInstanceProducer and SingeltonBeanInstanceProducer

Note: Most code is just moved or rearranged and was originally written
by imo, jgu and abr (SingeltonBeanInstanceProducer)
