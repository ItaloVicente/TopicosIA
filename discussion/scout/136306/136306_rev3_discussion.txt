DESCRIPTION:

Fix race condition in UiSession.init/SessionStore.doHouseKeeping

Reloding a browser tab may close new created ui session and invalidate
the http session. Sometimes the leftover client session is not fully
stopped leaving a memory leak

Closing a browser tab may leave a clientSession that is not stopped

Duplicating a browser tab creates a new uisession on an existing
clientSession which is correct, but it calls Desktop.execGuiAttached
which is wrong. When closing one of the duplicate tabs
Desktop.execGuiDetached is called which is wrong.

Added two tests to reproduce these issues and check that they are fixed.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Typo: Relo[a]ding

Line:72, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/ui/html/SessionStore.java -> Duplicate JavaDoc to both members (m_uiSessionMap and m_uiSessionPrototypeMap). Please also explain what the word "session prototype" means in this context. (I assume that they are preregistered-but-not-yet-registered UI sessions. Maybe the name m_preregisteredUiSessionMap would be clearer?)
