DESCRIPTION:

Add handy methods to StringUtility

The method StringUtility.contains() has an unconventional behavior.
Rather than just being a null-safe version of String.contains(), it
performs regex matching (ignoring the capitalization but without
specifying the UNICODE_CASE flag). Errors are printed to the log, but
are otherwise ignored. JavaDoc is unclear and unit tests are completely
absent. Most developers don't use this method correctly due to the
misleading name.

Additional variants with a specific purpose were therefore added:
- containsString()
- containsStringIgnoreCase()
- containsRegEx()
- matches()

Additionally, some missing null-safe versions of java.lang.String
methods were added for convenience reasons:
- startsWith()
- endsWidth()
- length()
- indexOf()
- lastIndexOf()

All new methods are documented and unit tested by StringUtilityTest.
