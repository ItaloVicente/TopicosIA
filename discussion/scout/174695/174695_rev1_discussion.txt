DESCRIPTION:

Widget: add reveal method

Brings the widget into view by scrolling the first scrollable parent.

Create ScrollOptions class instead of a boolean parameter
so that the other options can be added in the future more easily.
To add the align option, we should probably create
another class that extends ScrollOptions (e.g. ScrollToOptions
or RevealOptions because scrollTop() does not know that property.

Use ScrollOptions class for scrollToTop as well to allow animated
scrolling.

Looks good. I just found this issue below.
Line:405, eclipse-scout-core/src/session/ModelAdapter.js -> Why make a new object here? Is it wrong to pass the event object directly to the function?
This way we must refactor the code here, if a property is added to the ScrollOptions class.

Thank you for the review! See my comment.
Line:405, eclipse-scout-core/src/session/ModelAdapter.js -> The event may have some properties like 'type' that are not accepted (resp. interpreted) by the scroll functions. It would probably work to directly pass the object but they are actually two different types so I don't think we should do it.
