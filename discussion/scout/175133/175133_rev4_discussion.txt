DESCRIPTION:

Deactivate file drop when the field is disabled

Fields which allow to select a file via drag & drop always allow to drop
a file, even if the field is disabled.
This behavior does not fit into the normal disabled behavior of fields.
For example the FileInput.js does not allow to open a file dialog when
disabled but allows to drop a file. The drop behavior on disabled
fields should be to not accept any file drops.

This change uninstalls the drag & drop handler when the field is set to
disabled and installs it when the field is set to enabled.
