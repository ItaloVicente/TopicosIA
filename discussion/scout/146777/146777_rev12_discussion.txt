DESCRIPTION:

TileMode improvements / refactorings

- TileTableHeader is now of type IWidget instead of only an IGroupBox
- TableTileGridMediator is now a Widget and is synchronized between
backend/client. It provides a means to set important properties on the
table's tileAccordion which only exists in the ui.
- moved 'tiles' property from the table to the mediator, since only the
mediator needs the tiles. There is now a separated property for the
actual tiles and the tableRowTileMapping. The latter is now only used in
classic mode.
- fix problems with loadingSupport in tileMode
- fix problems with scrollable in tileMode
- improve tableLayout
