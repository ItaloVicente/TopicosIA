DESCRIPTION:

Session: Ensure poller does not permanently stop on JS error

When a JS error occurs during processing of a response to a ?poll
request, the "backgroundJobPollingSupport" state must not remain
RUNNING. Otherwise, the poller will never be rescheduled again, because
Session.js assumes that the poller is still running. This may cause the
server session to be invalidated unexpectedly (because there are no
?poll requests keeping it alive).

To fix this, the AJAX callback functions must ensure that the
"backgroundJobPollingSupport" state remains _only_ RUNNING iff the poll
request is rescheduled again. In all other cases the state must be set
to FAILURE or STOPPED.
