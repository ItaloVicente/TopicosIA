DESCRIPTION:

Harmonized search form, detail form and tool form

Improved page detail form handling:
The detail form is now created and started when the page gets activated
and closed when the page gets disposed, similar to the search form.
API added getConfiguredDetailForm, execInitDetailForm, createDetailForm,
startDetailForm

Migration:
Remove the detail form handling code from execPageActivated /
execPageDeactivated / execPageDisposed
and use either getConfiguredDetailForm / execInitDetailForm or
createDetailForm.

Improved page search form disposal:
Search form is now closed when the page gets disposed.

Simplified form tool buttons:
Refactored api to be consistent with detail and search form handling of
a page.
Removed code not necessary for html ui.

Migration:
Remove the form handling code from execStartForm and use either
getConfiguredForm / execInitForm or createForm.

Added IForm#start():
Mainly useful for forms with just one handler. (detail forms, tool forms
etc.). Maybe implemented by the concrete form.
The default implementation at AbstractForm uses getHandler() to start
the form.
