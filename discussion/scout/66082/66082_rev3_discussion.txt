DESCRIPTION:

Unset 'wait-for' hints immediately upon being unblocked

This guarantees the hints to be reflected immediately, so they can be
evaluated by the caller. Otherwise, they would be unset asynchronously
upon wake up of the blocked threads.

Use case: 
A 'blocked' Form gets unblocked via a JSON request. Upon unblocking the
Form, that JSON request likes to wait for all running model jobs, which
do not require UI interaction. That requires the hint to be removed
immediately, as the request would not wait for the released model job
otherwise.
