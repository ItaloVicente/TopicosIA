DESCRIPTION:

RequestHistory: prevent OOM when handling large sequence numbers

The request history keeps track of missed request sequence numbers. When
an attacker deliberately sends an absurdly large sequence number, the
map of missed requests was filled blindly with all numbers between the
last last seen request number and the current number. This could easily
lead to a denial of service situation, because the memory was filled up
quickly.

Because the requested sequence number is under the sender's control, a
separate sanity check must be performed _before_ filling the map. This
prevents the described attack. It should not be relevant under normal
circumstances, therefore the history can just be wiped completely.
