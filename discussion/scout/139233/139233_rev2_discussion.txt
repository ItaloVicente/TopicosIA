DESCRIPTION:

TableRowDetail: Remove menu bar from table

The table row detail removes the menubar of the table to ensure its own
menus are not affected by the table.

The problem was, that when the table was changed and triggered a menu
bar update, the table menu bar would then grab the menus of the table.
This then means that the menu would be linked to the table menu bar.
Since this menu bar is not rendered all the menus would be removed,
although they are still in use in the table row detail.
