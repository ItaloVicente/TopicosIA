DESCRIPTION:

Provide functionality to wait for the Future's finish state

Definition of 'done' and' 'finished'
done: completed or cancelled (same as Java Future done definition)
finished: completed, meaning that the job either completed normally, or will never commence execution due to premature cancellation

Use case:
In some situations it is required to really wait for a future to complete, regardless whether being cancelled or not. (e.g. when restarting some message queues)
