DESCRIPTION:

Class scanner (jandex) performance

improved performance of scout jandex class inventory by adding a refresh
strategy for cached index files. This only affects development time
application startup. The system property -Djandex.rebuild=true still
causes all workspace indexes to be rebuilt unconditionally. Without that
system property the scout.dev config property is checked. When set it
causes the scout jandex indexer to check all cached indexes with a file
system scan for changes. If a change was detected then the index is
rebuilt.
