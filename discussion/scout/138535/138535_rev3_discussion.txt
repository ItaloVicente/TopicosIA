DESCRIPTION:

Prevent potential JS error in Desktop.hideForm()

Apparently, there are situations where form.displayParent is not defined
(currently not reproducible, was reported by users). A check should fix
those problems.

This is a backport of commit 2c7bd346b7fc4ee42738a41b1c0fb1389195708d
from 8.0.x branch.

Original commit message:

  Form not unregistered correctly after close if opened as popup window
 
  If a form is opened as popup window, pressing the "x" on the window
  closes the form after 2 seconds. This did not work correctly anymore
  because form.hide did not call desktop.hideForm anymore because the
  form was not rendered at that time. Reason: DesktopFormController
  removes the form before calling close, which is a bit strange but
  obviously necessary for IE.
 
  Because the popup windows were not cleaned up correctly, exceptions
  of type Cannot read property 'popupWindow' of null were likely after
  a popup window was opened once.
