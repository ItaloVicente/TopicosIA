DESCRIPTION:

Table: fix auto optimize width measurement for cells with images

The auto optimize width calculation of a column needs the images to be
loaded, otherwise the width will be wrong because non loaded images have
a width of 0. The images are loaded asynchronously unless they are
loaded from cache. This means the calculation has to be delayed until
all images are loaded. The measurement div must not be removed until the
images are loaded otherwise the image load event would never be
triggered.

In order to get a correct result ALL images have to be loaded so if the
table has a lot of different (non cached images), auto resizing a column
may lead to a lot of requests.
