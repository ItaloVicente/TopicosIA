DESCRIPTION:

EmptySpace menus not executed on disabled table/tree selection

If a disabled row/node is selected in a table/tree, the empty space
context menus could not be executed even though these menus are not
related to the selection.
This was because the root context menu was disabled as soon as the
selection contained disabled elements.
Now the root context menu is only disabled if the table/tree is
completely disabled. On the other hand if only the selection contains
disabled rows (at least one), the single- and multi-selection menus
are disabled only.

Looks good, I tested it with the table, it works well. I am wondering whether the TileGrid is affected, too?
Line:266, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client.test/src/test/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/action/menu/TableMenuTest.java -> Why is this enabled if no row is selected? Is it only invisible? If that's existing behavior it 's ok.

Line:273, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client.test/src/test/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/action/menu/TableMenuTest.java -> What about empty space menus?

Line:144, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/action/ActionUtility.java -> This generates a dependency cycle between Table, Tree and ActionUtility. I would prefer keeping such general utilities independent of specific widgets. This helps when creating new widgets (maybe not in Scout itself) which require the same functionality.
The Table and Tree menu could call the updateEnabledStateOfSelectionMenus right after calling updateContextMenuEnabledState.

Line:161, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/action/ActionUtility.java -> See comment above, the menu types or the menusToUpdate could be passed by the table or tree context menu

Line:285, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/action/ActionUtility.java -> Why not also use skipElement here?

Line:266, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client.test/src/test/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/action/menu/TableMenuTest.java -> Exactly the menus are not enabled/disabled based on the type but set visible/invisible instead. So if the type does not match, this has no effect on the enabled state. This is existing behavior yes.
This check here is to verify the initial state to ensure the selection change below has an effect and it is not already disabled from the beginning.

Line:273, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client.test/src/test/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/action/menu/TableMenuTest.java -> Correct, I can add an assertion for those as well

Line:144, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/action/ActionUtility.java -> Agree

Line:161, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/action/ActionUtility.java -> Agree

Line:285, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/action/ActionUtility.java -> Because it is not the same: skipElement also checks for inheritAccessibility but this check should not be included here. Sub menus with inheritAccessibility=false should still be included in the computation as they are relevant for the state of the parent.
