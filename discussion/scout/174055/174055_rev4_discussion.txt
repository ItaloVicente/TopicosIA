DESCRIPTION:

EmptySpace menus not executed on disabled table/tree selection

If a disabled row/node is selected in a table/tree, the empty space
context menus could not be executed even though these menus are not
related to the selection.
This was because the root context menu was disabled as soon as the
selection contained disabled elements.
Now the root context menu is only disabled if the table/tree is
completely disabled. On the other hand if only the selection contains
disabled rows (at least one), the single- and multi-selection menus
are disabled only.

I've tested this change in our application. At first, it didn't work. The menu was still disabled. Then i've checked the menu configuration. It looked like this:

protected Set<? extends IMenuType> getConfiguredMenuTypes() {
                  return CollectionUtility.hashSet(TableMenuType.EmptySpace, TableMenuType.SingleSelection);
                }

I removed the "SingleSelection" configuration and after that it worked. I guess the configuration above is not so sensible, nor is it completely wrong. I had expected that a menu is enabled in that case too.
Line:151, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/action/ActionUtility.java -> use "widget" instead of "w" as parameter name
