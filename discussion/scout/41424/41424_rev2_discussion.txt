DESCRIPTION:

Fix bug in calculation of context-menu position
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=431030

* This commit corrects a bug in the calculation of the context menu
position for controls that do not fill the parent's boundaries;
* Also for ImageFields, their relative positioning is respected;

Original bug: A context-menu is to be rendered at the current mouse
position unless the mouse is positioned somewhere else on the screen -
this is the case  if having a control that owns the focus, the mouse is
moved away and the context-menu opened by keyboard.
