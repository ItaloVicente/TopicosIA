DESCRIPTION:

Table: Prevent shifting text when clicking to edit a clearable cell.

This prevents the content in BasicFields within TableFields from moving
a few pixels to the side when the clearable icon is shown, for cells
that are left- or right-aligned. The behavior is not changed for
centered cells, as the additional left padding needed would result in a
large amount of whitespace and a smaller editing area.
