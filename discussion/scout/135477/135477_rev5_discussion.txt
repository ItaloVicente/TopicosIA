DESCRIPTION:

Change calculation for context menu position on table

On a table the context menu of a row can be opened by mouseclick or by
clicking the menu key on the keyboard. When the mouse is used the
context menu opens at the current cursor position. When the menu key is
used the context menu is opened on the following row with descending
priority:
* Last clicked row
* Last of the selected rows

When this calculated row is not on the screen (anymore) this can cause a
javascript error. One way to reproduce this is opening a large table,
select all rows and click the menu key on the keyboard. The context menu
tries to be opened on the last line of the table which is not rendered
yet on the screen.

This commit changes the calculation for the context menu position in the
following way:
* Last clicked row if it is selected
* Last selected row that is visible on the screen
* Fixed position in the top left corner of the table
