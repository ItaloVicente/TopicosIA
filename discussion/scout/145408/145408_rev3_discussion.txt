DESCRIPTION:

Sequence Box loses field status on page reload

The sequence box has a special logic that moves the last inner field's
status to the box itself. The box status is backed up to restore it when
the inner field's status is removed.
Because this logic was only applied when the box status changed but not
when it is initially set the sequence box lost its initial field status.
This caused the sequence box to not have a field status even it was set
by getConfiguredTooltipText or after reloading the page.

This issue is solved by using the special backup logic also when
initializing the field.
