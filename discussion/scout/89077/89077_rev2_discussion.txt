DESCRIPTION:

Fix for onRowMouseDown/Up in editable and sortable Table

When an editable Table is sorted by the UI Server all rows in the DOM
will be recreated after a cell-edit. Because of that, the comparison
between the MouseDownRow and MouseUpRow in _onRowMouseUp did an early
abort, which made it impossible to edit a cell and then click on a next
editable cell and begin editing with just one click.
