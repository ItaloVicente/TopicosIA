DESCRIPTION:

FormTableControl: Prevent errors when inner form is destroyed

When the form in a form table control is destroyed, it has to be
unlinked from the table control. Otherwise, when the content is
rendered, an exception is thrown, because the "form" widget is
destroyed.

Test cases:
- Inner form closes itself (e.g. using a close button)
- Outline tree with a table page that has a open form table control is
  reloaded --> Form is closed before "nodesRemoved" events are sent. If
  due to some logic, the form is activated as well (e.g. outline
  changed), an exception occurs.
