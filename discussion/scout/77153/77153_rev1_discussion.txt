DESCRIPTION:

Fix static NLS texts in *.js files

For security reasons, inline <script> blocks were moved to dedicated
*.js files. However, static NLS texts cannot easily be replaced in *.js
files, only in *.html files. The resulting *.js files were therefore nto
valid.

To fix the broken texts, the NLS text references were moved back to the
HTML files. They are written to the body as special <scout-text> tags.
The method scout.Texts.readFromDOM() can be used to read them from
there.
