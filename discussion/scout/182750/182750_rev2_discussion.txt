DESCRIPTION:

Allow smart column batch lookup resolving to handle key of type 'object'

The batch resolving of lookup values used to store the values in an
objects map which resulted in objects being transformed to
keySet[Object object] regardless of the objects content. To allow
objects as lookup keys this mapping has to be optimised.

- For the remote lookup the keys will now be stored in a Set which
  keeps all the objects information. The backend can already handle this
  object keys.
- The text map returned by a lookup call now contains stringified object
  keys. Non objects keys are left unchanged.
