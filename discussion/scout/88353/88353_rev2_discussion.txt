DESCRIPTION:

CompactTree: Fix possible "Cannot read property 'hasClass' of undefined"

When a "selectNodes"-ModelEvent was handled, before the selected Node(s)
were builded (see _$buildNode()) an error with "Cannot read property
'hasClass' of undefined" was thron. This changes fixes this, by not
accessing the DOM in selectNodes().
