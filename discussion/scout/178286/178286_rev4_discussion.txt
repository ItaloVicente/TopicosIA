Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Write first letter in upper case
Remove duplicate space
Add a description what this feature does
Reference ticket number

Line:21, eclipse-scout-core/src/desktop/notification/DesktopNotification.js -> remove is, only call it nativeOnly

Line:26, eclipse-scout-core/src/desktop/notification/DesktopNotification.js -> Better name this NativeNotificationVisibility, maybe ask mvi what he prefers. "Type" is too generic imho. Also add js doc to the values describing what they do.

Line:64, eclipse-scout-core/src/desktop/notification/DesktopNotification.js -> Rename to isDocumentHidden.

Line:77, eclipse-scout-core/src/desktop/notification/DesktopNotification.js -> don't use arrow function, create a class method to make it extensible
Call method _showNativeNotification. We usually use create only for the construction, but here it is more (click handler, destroy). Rename existing _show to _renderNativeNotification

Line:78, eclipse-scout-core/src/desktop/notification/DesktopNotification.js -> rename status to permission which is the official name

Line:81, eclipse-scout-core/src/desktop/notification/DesktopNotification.js -> remove scout., just import strings as regular ES import

Line:88, eclipse-scout-core/src/desktop/notification/DesktopNotification.js -> What is the default? Please use a comment to describe what preventDefault would do.

Line:104, eclipse-scout-core/test/desktop/notification/DesktopNotificationSpec.js -> What do these tests test? Create test groups using describe (e.g. native notification, notificationType)
Use "it" to describe the test case
native notification
  notificationType
    'background' shows native notification only when document is hidden
    'always' shows native notification even when document is focused
    'never' never shows native notification
  nativeOnly
    'true' shows only the native notification
    'false' shows both, the desktop and the native notification
  is disposed immediately if duration is set to infinite
  is disposed later if duration is > 0

maybe also create tests for permission checks (e.g. what happens if permission is denied)

Line:122, eclipse-scout-core/test/desktop/notification/DesktopNotificationSpec.js -> When testing dispose, use show instead of render so tat you can check that desktop does not contain any notification anymore

Line:2859, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/AbstractDesktop.java -> Use consistent naming. Method names are called NativeNotification>>Type<<, but property is called NATIVE_NOTIFICATION_>>STYLE<<

Line:198, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/IDesktop.java -> use only not just

Line:29, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/notification/DesktopNotification.java -> remove "is"

Line:81, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/notification/DesktopNotification.java -> Format correctly, enable auto format on commit

Line:103, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/notification/DesktopNotification.java -> This explanation is not clear (NotificationType always has an effect, not only if this flag is false). Proposal:
True, to only show the native desktop notification. False, to show both, the regular and the native notification. If and when a native desktop notification is shown is controlled by {@link #getNativeNotificationType).

Line:58, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/notification/IDesktopNotification.java -> Move javadoc from implementation to interface. Now there are two different explanations. There is no need to keep both.

Line:419, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/ui/html/json/desktop/JsonDesktop.java -> Is this property used on Desktop.js? If no, there is no need to transfer it.
