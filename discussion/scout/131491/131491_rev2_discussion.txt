DESCRIPTION:

Remove misleading property 'scout.http.retryPost'

The misleading config property 'scout.http.retryPost' does not just
enable/disable retryPost. Setting to true it did enable the retry of
all requests, event POST requests that were already fully submitted.
The appropriate name for what was intended would be
'retryNonIdempotentSentRequest'.

However, the default handling by apache client is sufficient and
requires no global scout property to be inserted.

By default apache http retries a request when
- it is an idempotent request (HEAD, GET)
- the request was not fully sent

therefore default apache http does not retry a request when
- it is not idempotent (PUT, POST, DELETE, ...)
- the request is not idempotent and was fully sent
