DESCRIPTION:

Fix bug where a Popup could exist without having a parent element.

This could happen if a context menu was registered on table to be opened
via callback, but the table was no longer attached when the callback was
executed, leading to a "dangling" Popup. We now check if the table is
still attached before executing the callback.
