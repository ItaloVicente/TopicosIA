DESCRIPTION:

MOM: Improve compatibility with JEE containers

- Allow to disable 'request-reply' messaging feature if it is not
  required. Request-reply messaging requires a cancellation topic that
  is created during initialization. However, some containers don't allow
  creating topics on the fly. If request-reply messaging is not used, it
  can be easier to disable the feature rather than to create a topic in
  the app servers admin console.
- The name of the cancellation topic can now also be configured per MOM.
- The default marshaller can now be configured per MOM.
  In Java code, the AbstractMomTransport base class provides a new
  method "getConfiguredDefaultMarshaller". The method
  IMomImplementor.setDefaultMarshaller() is no longer required and was
  removed.
  In config.properties, the default marshaller can be configured using
  the environment property "scout.mom.marshaller".
- The internal method "installMessageListener()" in the MOM strategy
  classes was renamed to "installMessageConsumer()" to reflect the fact,
  that consumer does not necessarily need to be implemented as a
  IMessageListener but also using the blocking "receive()" operation.
- JmsMomImplementor.init() now releases any allocated resources on
  error. The method was also split into smaller methods to simplify
  project-specific customization.
- JmsMessageReader converts a missing "marshaller context" property to
  an empty map to prevent NPEs. This is the reverse operation of
  JmsMessageWriter that converts an empty marshaller context to null.
