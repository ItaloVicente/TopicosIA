DESCRIPTION:

JS error on reloading outline with invisible node

When the outline has an invisible and expanded node the reload of the
outline results in a JS error. The reason is that the node is removed
because is invisible. But the buffered events of the node and its
children are not cleaned up.

Solution is to send a node removed event so that the event buffer can
remove the obsolete events that were added before. This is done by using
the official removeNode method instead of calling the
removeChildNodesInternal method that does not send any events.
