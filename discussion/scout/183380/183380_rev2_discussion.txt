DESCRIPTION:

TileGrid: ensure layout is valid after inserting a hidden tile

If a tile is inserted but not visible (e.g. due to an active filter),
it gets the animate-insert class which prevents the layout validation
-> don't animate invisible tiles

Also, if all tiles are made visible/invisible by a filter, the scrollbar
won't be updated correctly. It works well, if only some tiles are
affected because in that case the TileGridLayout does the scrollbar
update after the move animation => Update scrollbar after the
filter-animation.
Since this is a fast process it is not necessary to do it only once
for all tiles, as it is done when tiles are deleted.
