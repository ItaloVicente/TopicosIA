DESCRIPTION:

Add execution hint for model jobs that cannot be cancelled by the user

Sometimes it is necessary to either perform all operations of a block or
none of them. Typically, such a block would be executed within its own
transaction. However, Scout client itself does not support transactions.

With a new execution hint, a model job can at least be protected against
termination by the user (other termination sources are not suppressed).
