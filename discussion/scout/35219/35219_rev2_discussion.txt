Fixed the various problems when requesting the proposal popup and
accepting proposals in form-fields as well as in cell-editors. The main
issue was that the popup dialog became the active shell and focus owner
which triggered to many verify events. Furthermore, the event and focus
handling of cell-editors that open a Shell was facilitated and improved
to have the same behavior as in a smartfield cell editor.
