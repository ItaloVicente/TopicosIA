DESCRIPTION:

Calendar: fix selected bug

When clicking into the whitespace of a day in the calendar which has
items, the selected property wasn't correctly set and rendered.

the problem is that in _onDayMouseDown nothing was done when the event
phase was bubbling.
But on days with items this approach doesn't work, since the click into
the whitespace happens in the 'calendar-scrollable-components' div. The
calender mouseDown handler is registered on the parent 'calendar-day'
div.

The current implementation checks if the event's target is not a
calendar-component which leads to the desired behavior without bugs.
