DESCRIPTION:

TileGrid: Restore scroll position for all parents to prevent scrolling

Previously the TileGrid did already restore the scroll position for its
direct parent, actually a focus call may also trigger scroll events for
other parents therefore the scroll position must be restored for all
parents.
