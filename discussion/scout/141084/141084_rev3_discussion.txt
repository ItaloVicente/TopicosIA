DESCRIPTION:

Dialog: only activate focus ctx when activeElement is outside subtree

This addresses the following problem:
When an editable table has an open cell editor (e.g. a StringField) and
the user clicks the clear icon ("x"), the focus was lost but the cell
editor stayed open. Reason: the cell editor has a separate focus
context. Because the dialog has registered a click listener (in the
capture phase), it activates itself. This activates the dialog's focus
context, causing the cell editor to lose the focus.

Fix: when the dialog is activated, only activate the focus context when
the current focus owner is outside the dialog's DOM subtree.
