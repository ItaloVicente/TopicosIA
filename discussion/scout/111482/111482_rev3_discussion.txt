DESCRIPTION:

Composer: initialize dynamically added menus

Because AddEntityMenus are added after the composers's tree nodes are
constructed, they are not initialized automatically. Therefore,
execInitAction() is never call, which can lead to missing labels.

Rule of thumb:
The creator of a menu is responsible for its initialization.
