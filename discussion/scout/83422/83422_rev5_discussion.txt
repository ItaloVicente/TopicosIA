DESCRIPTION:

added contextColumn property support for Table

Previously the server side property contextColumn was only updated with
the rowClicked event. Introduce contextColumn as a client side property
and notify server onMouseDown by a propertyChanged event.
Solves the problem of server model not being updated on right-clicks.
