DESCRIPTION:

Widget: add method to check parents visibility

The visible state of a field will not change if the visible state of the
surrounding parent changes. If the parent is invisible you can't see the
contained field, but the visible state of the field will not reflect
this behavior. If you want to check the real visible state of a field
you have to check the visibility attribute for the field itself and for
the whole parent hierarchy. To check if all parents are visible there is
now a new method on the widget.
