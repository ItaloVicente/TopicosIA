DESCRIPTION:

SessionStore.doHousekeeping reports sessions closed by another session 

Logback and other logger implementations push parent thread MDC entries
to a newly created thread. This is not wanted if the new thread is
managed by a pool.

Change Scout's NamedThreadFactory to clear any MDC entries just after
a new thread has been started.
