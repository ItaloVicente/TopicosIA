DESCRIPTION:

DateUtility, ObjectUtility: Fix compareTo, equals for Date / Timestamp

This fixes inconsistent precision and asymmetry of comparisons as well
as erroneous results (due to JDK-8135055) in both DateUtility and
ObjectUtility. Whereas previously the precision of the comparison could
be dependent on the types and order of the arguments, comparisons are
now always done exactly, i.e. Timestamp values are no longer
automatically truncated to milliseconds or seconds.

The following existing methods in are affected and may now return
different results:
- DateUtility: isInRange, intersects, max, min, equals
- ObjectUtility: equals, compareTo

New behavior:
- DateUtility/ObjectUtility.equals/compareTo: ns precision

Previous behavior:
- DateUtility.equals(Timestamp, Date): ns precision
- DateUtility.equals(Date, Timestamp): ms precision, wrong (*)
- ObjectUtility.equals(Timestamp, Date): ms precision
- ObjectUtility.equals(Date, Timestamp): ms precision
- ObjectUtility.compareTo(Timestamp, Date): ns precision
- ObjectUtility.compareTo(Date, Timestamp): ms precision, wrong (*)

Default Java Timestamp/Date behavior:
- Timestamp.equals(Date): always false
- Date.equals(Timestamp): ms precision
- Timestamp.compareTo(Date): ns precision
- Date.compareTo(Timestamp): ms precision, wrong (*)

(*) wrong on Java 8 and below due to JDK-8135055, fixed from Java 9 on:
Date.compareTo(Timestamp) always ignores fractional seconds of
java.sql.Timestamp (reading them as 0), leading to wrong results unless
the Timestamp has no fractional parts.
