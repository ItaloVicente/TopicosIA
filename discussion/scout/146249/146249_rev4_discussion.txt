DESCRIPTION:

DateUtility, ObjectUtility: Fix compareTo, equals for Date / Timestamp

This fixes erroneous results for compareTo due to JDK-8135055, and
inconsistent precision and asymmetry of comparisons in DateUtility and
ObjectUtility. Whereas previously the precision of the comparison could
be dependent on the types and order of the arguments, comparisons are
now always done exactly, i.e. Timestamp values are no longer
automatically truncated to milliseconds.

In addition to equals/compareTo, the following existing methods in
DateUtility are also affected and may return different results:
isInRange, intersects, max, min
- ObjectUtility: equals, compareTo

Previous behavior:
- DateUtility.equals(Timestamp, Date): ns precision
- DateUtility.equals(Date, Timestamp): ms precision, wrong (*)
- ObjectUtility.equals(Timestamp, Date): ms precision
- ObjectUtility.equals(Date, Timestamp): ms precision
- ObjectUtility.compareTo(Timestamp, Date): ns precision
- ObjectUtility.compareTo(Date, Timestamp): ms precision, wrong (*)

Default Java Timestamp/Date behavior:
- Timestamp.equals(Date): always false
- Date.equals(Timestamp): ms precision
- Timestamp.compareTo(Date): ns precision
- Date.compareTo(Timestamp): ms precision, wrong (*)

(*) wrong on Java 8 and below due to JDK-8135055, fixed from Java 9 on:
Date.compareTo(Timestamp) always ignores fractional seconds of
java.sql.Timestamp (reading them as 0), leading to wrong results unless
the Timestamp has no fractional parts.

Implementation note: DateUtility.compareTo could also be implemented
using -1 * a.compareTo(b): However this relation is not specified and a
new Timestamp object would be created regardless (in Timestamp.compareTo
when called with a Date argument).
