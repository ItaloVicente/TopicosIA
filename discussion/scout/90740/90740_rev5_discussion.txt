DESCRIPTION:

Keystrokes should not fire if a modal dialog is open

This change fixes the handling of keystrokes with modality:
- Added Desktop as ScopeTarget for ViewMenuTabs, DesktopNavigationHandle
and DesktopKeyStrokes
- Added new Field GlassPaneDisplayParents in FocusManager and made
GlassPaneRenderer register those parents accordingly (Necessary that
FocusManager can decide ‘isElementCovertByGlassPane’ for Desktop, Forms,
..)
- Added new Property „keystrokeFirePolicy “ on Action and made
KeyStrokeManager capable of handle it (“ALWAYS” Allows
(Desktop-)KeyStrokes that
can be triggered even if a modal form is open)
