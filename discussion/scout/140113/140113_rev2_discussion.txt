DESCRIPTION:

PopupWithHead: fix measurement of blueprint element

To prevent measuring wrong sizes, margins etc., the style has to be
copied from the blueprint element before the layout is validated (during
_render). During positioning, the copy is repeated because _positionImpl
is called multiple times with different alignments. (However, we expect
that this does not change anything at the $head size!)
