DESCRIPTION:

TileGrid: Fix layout problem with invisible tiles

Css class 'invisible' was sometimes not removed because the event was 
not triggered. It did not happen during active user scrolling but when 
scroll position changed after replacing the tiles 
(e.g. many tiles replaced with only a few tiles).
