DESCRIPTION:

SmartField: non-destructive keys should not set "user was typing" flag

When pressing certain modifier keys such as alt, ctrl, home, etc., the
internal property _userWasTyping should not be set to true, because the
contents don't have changed.

This fixes the following case in Scout JS:
- Display style = dropdown
- Custom _formatLookupRow() method, that renders a display text that
  cannot be mapped back to a single lookup row.
- Choose a value, press a non-destructive key (e.g. alt-tab)
- Field will get an error status, because it thinks the user was typing
  and therefore tries to resolve the lookup row (which does not work
  because of the differently formatted display text)
