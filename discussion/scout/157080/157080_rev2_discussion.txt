DESCRIPTION:

JsonTree: Group INSERT and DELETE events on NODE_FILTER_CHANGED

Nodes made visible or invisible by a tree filter are converted to
NODES_INSERTED and NODES_DELETED events, respectively. This change
collects nodes by their parents, thereby creating as few events as
possible, which may be further coalesced by the TreeEventBuffer.
