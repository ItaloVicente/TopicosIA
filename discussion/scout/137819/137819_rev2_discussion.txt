DESCRIPTION:

Preserve correlationId of client notifications

The client notification sent from the server contains the correlationId
of the server task that created the notification. This id is set to the
dispatching context on client side by the ClientNotificationDispatcher.
The AbstractObservableNotificationHandler notifies the listeners
asynchronously in an extra thread. The correlationId is now also passed
to this listener notifying thread. This allows to connect the server
task with the corresponding client notification listener that handles
the notification that originated from that task.
