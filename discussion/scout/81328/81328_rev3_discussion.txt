DESCRIPTION:

New method Platform.peek

Platform.get is auto-starting the Platform. However, in unit testing
it is desired to peek for the current implementation without the
Platform to start. This change adds a new method Platform.peek.
At the same time Platform.stop will stop the platform as before but will
not set it to null. @RunWithNewPlatform has an additional property to
define the platform used by the test.
