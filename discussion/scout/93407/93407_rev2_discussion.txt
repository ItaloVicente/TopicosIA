DESCRIPTION:

BlockingTestUtility: wait for condition only in case of no exception

When runnableGettingBlocked.run() throws an exception, this exception is
translated and rethrown. In the finally part, a waitForUninterruptibly
is executed, which will fail in such a situation. The original exception
will be hidden and only the new exception is displayed.
