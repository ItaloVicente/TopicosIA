DESCRIPTION:

Unselect submenus when menu is closed

In a table when a menu is opened and then closed again by clicking
somewhere else on the screen the menu button also gets unselected again.
In case the menu is being closed while submenus are expanded these
submenus are not unselected. This results in opening the submenu again
when reloading the page or opening an element in the table that has the
same menu.

Solution is to unselect the expanded submenus when the menu is closed.
