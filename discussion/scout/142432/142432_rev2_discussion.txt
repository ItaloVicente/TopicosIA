DESCRIPTION:

IClientSession.stop can block in custom code

Http session timeout, logout and custom calls to IClientSession.stop
must stop and dispose the client session and all its forms and
resources. However if some form or listener that is called synchronously
by processing stop then the stop is not guaranteed to proceed.

This change summarizes all stop, check, cancel and detect code ion the
new @Bean ClientSessionStopHelper.

The IClientSession.stop process starts a background loop with
ClientSessionStopHelper.scheduleJobTerminationLoop that continuously
detects and cancels jobs that are somehow blocking or taking too long.

That tool still gives no 100% guarantee for session stop but it takes
all efforts to come near that goal.

The property that defines how long is 'too long' for a job to run is
(still) defined in JobCompletionDelayOnSessionShutdown with a default of
10 seconds per detection round.
