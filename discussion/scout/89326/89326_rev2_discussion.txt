DESCRIPTION:

Check for already installed MultiSessionCookieStore and throw

- MultiSessionCookieStore is registered within JRE for all instances of
Http-Client, but cannot be shared between multiple Scout deployments
(session lookup won't work between different class loaders)
- Added a check and throw an exception if this case is detected to
facilitate finding the problem (user will never be able to login to the
application which is deployed as second application)
- Allow to re-install the 'same' MultiSessionCookieStore implementation
(e.g. happens in unit tests if platform is re-initialized)
