DESCRIPTION:

Cherry Pick in order to fix session dispose memory leak

-- The first commit's message is:
fix flip/flop test

1 second jms timeout is too short in some junit test runner environments

-- This is the 2nd commit message:
Fix race condition in UiSession.init/SessionStore.doHouseKeeping

Reloding a browser tab may close new created ui session and invalidate
the http session. Sometimes the leftover client session is not fully
stopped leaving a memory leak

Closing a browser tab may leave a clientSession that is not stopped

Duplicating a browser tab creates a new uisession on an existing
clientSession which is correct, but it calls Desktop.execGuiAttached
which is wrong. When closing one of the duplicate tabs
Desktop.execGuiDetached is called which is wrong.

Added two tests to reproduce these issues and check that they are fixed.

--

Session.close must use correct session reference

when closing a client session, all model jobs of this session are
cancelled. The reference to the session must be "this" and not the
calling threads session.

--

Remove problematic IBlockingCondition.waitForUninterruptibly

The method IBlockingCondition.waitForUninterruptibly was introduced
before ModelJobs.EXECUTION_HINT_UI_INTERACTION_REQUIRED and was intended
to make calls to waitFor (using a blocking condition) insensitive to
user cancellation.

Since ModelJobs.EXECUTION_HINT_UI_INTERACTION_REQUIRED a user
cancellation cancels all model jobs except those with that hint.

Therefore IBlockingCondition.waitForUninterruptibly is not only
obsolete, it is problematic due to its behaviour of swallowing
InterruptedExceptions.

In addition changed behaviour of AbstractDesktop.closeInternal by
separating code into more finegrained internal methods.
Session/Desktop close has the phases:
- hide registered forms
- interrupt blocking condition
- close messageboxes, filechoosers, forms
- close desktop extensions
- interrupt blocking condition (new occurrences)
- close messageboxes, filechoosers (new occurrences)

--

Safe Session close

ensure that session closes safely and does not exit with exceptions
ensure that session.store() is called within safe bounds
ensure that desktop does not accept new blocking conditions once in
stopping mode

-- This is the 3rd commit message:
Fix race condition in UiSession.init/SessionStore.doHouseKeeping (2)

minor changes: variable names, javadoc

-- This is the 4th commit message:
Memory leak in AbstractForm

The member field m_initialClientRunContext holds a reference to the
complete ThreadLocal stack of the caller including the UiSession.

When reloading the browser tab, this reference is not freed and the
UiSession is not gc-ed.

Replaced the ClientRunContext by the ModelContext.

-- This is the 5th commit message:
Fix race condition in UiSession.init/SessionStore.doHouseKeeping (3)

minor changes: local var naming

-- This is the 6th commit message:
cleanup after cherry pick
