Hey Beat,

As discussed, I created a little utility that allows for the selection of properties in an object graph using a path like expression string.
Can you please have a look and give me your feedback!

Thx very much!

Michael

Looks good, thanks for the tests! I added some minor remarks that we can discuss together.
Line:194, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> Maybe give an example?

Line:198, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> Does the result need to be an object? I think we want to use it like that, but it does not have to be that way. --> findByPath?

Line:202, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> const instead of let?

Line:206, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> If you would use " as quotes inside the string, it would require much less escaping here and in the corresponding spec.

Line:213, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> Does the for-of-loop offer any advantage? Usually, we use forEach():
path.split('.').forEach(pathElement => { ... })

Line:214, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> What are these numbers?

Line:229, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> Or just "if (arrayPropertyFilter) { ... }"

Line:231, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> This seems to be fine on newer browsers, but for consistency reasons we should use the traditional "Array.isArray()" here.

Line:236, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> Is the hasOwnProperty() check required?

Line:241, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> Alternative: simply use the first result and ignore the rest.

Line:250, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> Simpler: if (pathMatchedSoFar) { ... }

Thanks for your feedback, Beat!
I addressed all your comments.
Line:194, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> I added some examples in the method's doc block.

Line:198, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> As discussed on the phone I renamed the function to "getByPath()" as the whole path expression must match the object tree provided. If a less strict behavior is needed in the future, we can stick to our usual pattern and create an "optByPath()" function.

Line:202, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> Done

Line:206, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> Done

Line:213, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> You are right. I remember expecting needing to break out of the for loop eventually which was not the case at the end, as the array is either iterated completely (the path matches the structure of the object) or an exception is thrown.
Changed to forEach().

Line:214, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> They are just the numberings of the steps in the algorithm. I removed them, they don't add any value.

Line:229, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> Done

Line:231, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> Done

Line:236, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> No, I removed it.

Line:241, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> As discussed on the phone, I kept the current behavior to maintain the "strict" character of this function.

Line:250, eclipse-scout-core/src/util/objects.js -> Done
