DESCRIPTION:

Re-evaluate action-enabled for steps class after activeStepIndex change

Previously the action-enabled class was only set in _renderSteps
(depending on activeStepIndex). However as the action-enabled class
seems to depend on activeStepIndex (see if condition) it must be
re-evaluated after activeStepIndex changes. There may even be events
where both activeStepIndex and steps were changed, however when
_renderSteps was called first the if-condition was evaluated using the
previous activeStepIndex, immediately afterwards the activeStepIndex was
changed but the if-condition was not re-evaluated (class action-enabled
was not added for the step even though it was marked as action enabled
and it was not the active step anymore).
