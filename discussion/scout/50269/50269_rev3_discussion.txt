DESCRIPTION:

Simplify job exception handling by only work with ProcessingException.

For convenience purpose, IFuture provides an 'awaitDone' method which only throws a ProcessingException once being interrupted. That is in contrast to 'awaitDoneAndGet' method, which throws a ProcessingException if computation failed, or the job was cancelled.
