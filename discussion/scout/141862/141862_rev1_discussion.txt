DESCRIPTION:

Fixed multiple focus problems that arise when field becomes disabled.

Menu/-Bar: use enabledComputed instead of enabled, otherwise a menu item
which is disabled by its parent will be set as tabbable menu, which is
wrong and causes focus-errors.

FormField: Prevent problem where a field which is configured to have
"initial focus" becomes disabled while the form is initialized. This
caused the FocusManager to internally store an element which cannot be
focused in the DOM

FocusContext/jquery-scout.js: analog to 'hide', when the currently
focused element is disabled, it cannot have the focus anymore. Thus we
must update the FocusContext or else it will point to a DOM element that
is not focusable.
