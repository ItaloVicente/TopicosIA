DESCRIPTION:

NLS: change default value of file watcher to enabled and fix tests

Most of the test will be running in development mode. Therefore the NLS
file watcher will be active. The AssertNoRunningJobsStatement ensures
that all the jobs started in a test are finished after the test. For the
nls file watcher job its ok, that it remains active. Therefore we
exclude it in the statement.
