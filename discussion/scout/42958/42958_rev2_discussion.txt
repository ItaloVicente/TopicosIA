DESCRIPTION:

Make interrupted, blocked model-jobs not wait for the model-mutex to
become available

If a blocked job was unblocked and interrupted while re-acquiring the
model-mutex, the thread was blocked as long as the model-mutex was not
re-acquired yet. Changed implementation to return immediately with a
JobExecutionException instead.
