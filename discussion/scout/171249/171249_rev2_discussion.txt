DESCRIPTION:

SmtpConnectionPool - Improve exception handling

This change introduces some small changes to the handling of exceptions
in the SmtpConnectionPool. This should lead to more cases in which
connections that an exceptions occurred on are not put back into the
pool in order to prevent the pool from being full of defective
connections but not being aware of it and thus reusing the same
defective connections over and over again.
