DESCRIPTION:

reduced memory consumption of Cell instances

o moved htmlEnabled from CellExtension to CellStyle
o removed setMandatory-method from ICell interface (ICell is a read-only
view on a Cell)
o removed mandatory setting from CellStyle (It is already part of
CellExtension which is used for rarely used attributes (i.e. tool tip,
enabled, editable and mandatory)).
o defer creation of new CellStyle and CellExtension objects until they
are really needed
