DESCRIPTION:

PopupWindow: Link the window with the popup again, after popup is ready

Apparently, Chrome changed its behavior if the location of a window
changes and somehow loses the popupWindow property (custom property)
of the Window object, which was set before. This makes popup window
not recognizable as such.
