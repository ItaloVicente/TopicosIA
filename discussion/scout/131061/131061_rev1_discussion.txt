DESCRIPTION:

Tree: Make sure visible node list is updated on all filterStateChanged 

Attempting to select a non-expanded node
that is currently not visible (because another node is selected) in the
breadcrumb style tree view would leave the node invisble, if the
selected node was a top-level node without a parent. The visible node
list needs to be maintained in this case as well.
