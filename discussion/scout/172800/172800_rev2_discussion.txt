DESCRIPTION:

Mobile: view vanishes if display parent is a detail form

Since the detail form is embedded, it will be removed along with the
navigation whenever a view is opened. If the detail form is the
display parent of the view, the view will be removed as well
-> Never use detail forms as display parent on mobile (if the compact
desktop is active).
