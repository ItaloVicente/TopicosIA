DESCRIPTION:

Release threads waiting for a job to complete after transition into 'done' state

The 'done' parking mechanism of Java {@link FutureTask} cannot be used by {@link JobManager}, because waiting threads are released before {@link FutureTask#done()} is invoked. That results in a inconsistent state, because bookkeeping and event firing is to be done prior releasing any waiting thread.

This change also fixes the regression failures in job JUnit tests.
