DESCRIPTION:

Validate app version on startup

When a new app version is deployed and the user starts the application,
the browser-side resources (HTML, JS, CSS) are updated automatically.
The browser checks if index.html has changed by sending the Etag of the
cached resource. Because the file's content has changed, the Etag does
not match anymore and a new version of the file (where JS/CSS files with
different fingerprints are referenced) is retrieved.

However, there are rare cases where the browser does NOT check for
changes. In FF this may happen when "remember session" is active and the
user exits the browser. In Chrome this may happen when the "auto discard
inactive tabs" feature discards the applications tab. As a consequence,
the application starts up normally, but the browser-side JS/CSS files
may not be up-to-date.

To fix this problem, the server sends the "scout.application.version"
value to the UI with the startup response. The UI remembers that value
(in the session storage) and sends it back to server with any subsequent
startup request. If the versions do not match, a special error code (40)
is sent back to the UI, which causes a refresh of the page. The version
is remembered in the session storage, because when a new tab is opened,
the resources are always updated correctly.

Alternative solution:
The version could be compiled into the JS source code at build time.
This would be the safer solution (i.e. it would even work when a browser
or proxy does not respect the cache headers), but it would require
changes in every project's index.html. It would also be more difficult
to implement in development mode.
