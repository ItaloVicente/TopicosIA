DESCRIPTION:

FocusContext: prevent JS error when elementToFocus cannot be resolved

This commit improves the resilience of the _focus() method against bad
states and unexpected conditions. It has to deal with the case where the
desired "elementToFocus" is null for some reason. This should not
happen, but when it does, ignoring this case would cause JS errors.

- The check whether the elementToFocus has a focus() method (introduced
  with commit 9990aac127588184808ba59308a516a27cc5dd60 for SVG elements)
  must not assume that "elementToFocus" is defined. It was also moved up
  a few lines to prevent calling entryPoint(true) twice.
- If no elementToFocus can be determined, the method returns
  immediately.

How to reproduce an error that is fixed with this commit:
o Open two forms with an editable table with smart fields.
o Click in the table so that the popup is opened.
o While the popup is open, click the form tab of the other form.
o JS error happens.
