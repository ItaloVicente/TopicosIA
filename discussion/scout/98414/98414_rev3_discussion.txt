DESCRIPTION:

Fix bug where outlines no longer reacted to table filter events.

Pages now always have their detailTable set using Page.setDetailTable,
which takes care to subscribe all event listeners. Previously, this
only occurred when the detailTable was initialized eagerly (and handed
into the constructor), but not when initialized lazily.
