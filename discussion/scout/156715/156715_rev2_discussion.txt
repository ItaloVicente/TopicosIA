DESCRIPTION:

Wizard: Close the wizard when its container form is disposed.

When the container form of the wizard is being disposed, its wizard was
not closed. Usually the forms of the wizard steps are not managed by the
container form and will therefore be disposed once the wizard is closed.
The wizard is no Widget and will not be closed while the session is
destroyed, leaving some step forms undisposed.

Added a listener to the wizard to close the wizard once the container
form is disposed, to then close the wizard.

Added new property PROP_LIFE_CYCLE_MANAGED, which is true by default, to
disable this automatic closing of the wizard.

Line:363, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/wizard/AbstractWizard.java -> How can m_containerFormListener be != null at this point?

To make the code more readable i'd move the lambda-code to a method handleFormEvent(e) and use a method reference here.

Btw: what happens if someone calls the setLifecycleManaged() method after initConfig has been executed?

Line:367, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/wizard/AbstractWizard.java -> Why is this if block with doSuspend() required?

Line:488, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/wizard/AbstractWizard.java -> Maybe "managedByForm" would be a better name for the property?

Line:110, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/wizard/IWizard.java -> Please use the correct variable name instead of "b"

Line:112, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/wizard/IWizard.java -> There are some occurences in the Java code which use "lifecycle" as a single word and others that use camel case, like here. Which one is more widely used? I'd rather read "lifecycle" than "lifeCycle" - but maybe that's just a matter of taste :)
