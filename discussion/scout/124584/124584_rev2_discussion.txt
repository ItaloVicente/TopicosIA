DESCRIPTION:

IPage: don't create a table while page is disposing

It is not necessary to create a table in the disposal phase. It may even
lead to exceptions e.g. in
org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html.json.form.JsonForm.attachChildAdapters() on
logout. In that specific case the exception will never be displayed to
the user so it is not a big issue but it may prevent a proper logout.

Changed getTable() to getTable(false) on some obvious places where it is
not desired to create a new table. Also added a warning when the table
is created during disposal to be able to clean the code up.
