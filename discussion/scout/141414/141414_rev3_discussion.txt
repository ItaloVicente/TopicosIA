DESCRIPTION:

Tree: allow deleting nodes without a common parent node

Prevent error "Node order may not be updated because lengths of the
arrays differ" when deleting multiple nodes from the tree without
passing a common parent node. Previously, when no parent node was
passed, it was assumed that all nodes to be deleted are top-level nodes.
Because of this, the nodes are not removed from their parent's
childNodes list. This change checks if the nodes have a parent node and
use that node to correctly remove them from all data structures.
