DESCRIPTION:

ViewMenuPopup: fix item height

Calculated height of view menu popup was wrong on certain zoom levels.
Because the height was not set explicitly (only the line-height), the
browser could return fractional values when measuring the items. To fix
this, the 'line-height' was removed and replaced by 'height'. The
content is aligned using the "vertical align helper", so the line-height
property was not necessary anyway.
