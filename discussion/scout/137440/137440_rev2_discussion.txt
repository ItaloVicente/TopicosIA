DESCRIPTION:

Improve status handling on sequence box

When the last visible field in a sequence box changes its status the
status is moved to the sequence box to ensure the fields inside the
sequence box have the same size. When the sequence box itself also has
its own error status this status is being overwritten by the last
visible field and cannot be restored after the field clears its status
again.

Solution is to store the current status of the sequence box before it
gets overwritten by the last visible field and restore the status after
the fields status is cleared.
