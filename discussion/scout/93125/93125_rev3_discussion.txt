DESCRIPTION:

WrappedFormField: Allow closing/starting inner form

If the inner form is not managed by AbstractWrappedFormField, the form
can be closed and restarted again. Because closing the form
automatically disposes the JSON adapter, a new adapter is created when
the form is started again. The PROP_INNER_FORM property does not change
its value, but the JSON adapter must behave as if the inner form was set
to null.
