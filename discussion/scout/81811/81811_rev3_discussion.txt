DESCRIPTION:

Treat HTTP errors 503 and 504 as "no connection"

503 = Service Unavailable
504 = Gateway Timeout

Those errors can happen when the network has a (most likely) temporary
problem, e.g. when a load balancer has no available nodes to dispatch
the request. When they happen during a ?poll request and a message box
is shown, the poll loop breaks and the HTTP session will be invalidated
within a short period of time. To keep the poll loop alive, the
aforementioned status codes cause the UI to go offline (= starts the
reconnector).

All other status codes (e.g. 500 Internal Server Error) are still
handled as message box, as they indicate a persistent problem.
