DESCRIPTION:

Fixed form data export for wrapped forms

Wrapped forms are not exported into the outer form's data. This was
already implemented by using the target form data for selecting exported
fields. Property extensions however must be exported in a second run
that iterates over all form fields. This run did not stop at wrapped
form fields.

Additionally, setFormInternal was not correctly propagated on some
ICompositeField implementations.
