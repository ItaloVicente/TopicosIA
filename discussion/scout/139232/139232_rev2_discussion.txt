DESCRIPTION:

Ellipsis: Ensure child menus are not removed

When menu "A" in the left menubox is moved to the ellipsis menu, which
is in the right menubox, it was possible, that the ellipsis menu removed
Menu "A" on removal of itself. This happens if the right menu box is
redrawn. Since Menu "A" is still in the left menubox, it will remain not
rendered. This causes an error while layouting.

The solution is to ensure that the ellipsis menu is never the parent of
its child menus. This is ok, since the child menus remain in the menu
box, even if the are moved to the ellipsis menu.
