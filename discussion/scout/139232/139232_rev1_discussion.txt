DESCRIPTION:

Ellipsis: Ensure child menus are not removed when ellipsis is removed

Child menus of the ellipsis menu will still be in the left or right
menubox of the menubar. When menu A in the left menubox is moved to the
ellipsis menu which is in the right menubox, it was possible, that the
ellipsis menu removed Menu A. But since only the right menu box was
updated (and rendered), menu A was not rendered again, resulting in an
error.

The solution is to ensure that the ellipsis menu is never the parent of
its child menus. This is ok, since the child menus are still in the menu
box, which will remain its parent.
