DESCRIPTION:

Fix possible deadlock in ServerSession creation

Situation:
Two parallel requests (both without Scout server session but on the same
HTTP Session) arrive in
org.eclipse.scout.rt.server.session.ServerSessionCache.getOrCreate.
As there is no server session associated with the HTTP session yet, both
threads try to acquire the group lock.
The first enters the lock and creates a new server session and connects
it with the HTTP session.
After the first released the lock the second thread enters the lock,
reuses the same server session but registers a new
ScoutSessionBindingListener. This leads to the situation that the
existing listener (which was registered by the first thread) is unbound.
This triggers the first ScoutSessionBindingListener. It tries to remove
its own server session and group lock, while holding the lock.

First this leads to a deadlock because it is not possible to remove its
own lock, while holding it.
Second (if it would not create a deadlock) it would remove the running
server session without any reason just because a second request arrived
at the same time killing both request (because the server session is
being stopped again).

Fix: only the first one (the one that actually created the session)
should register the attributes on the HTTP session.
