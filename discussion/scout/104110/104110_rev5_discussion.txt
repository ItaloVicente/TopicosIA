DESCRIPTION:

Table: allow the configuration of the column minimum width

If a regular column should be made very small (e.g. 32px), this was not
possible because the ui defined a minimum width of 60px. Only boolean
and icon columns were allowed to be smaller than that.

Because there are cases where such small columns may be useful, the
configuration of the minimum width is now possible using the new column
property minWidth.

This was mainly added to make the organize column form smaller.
