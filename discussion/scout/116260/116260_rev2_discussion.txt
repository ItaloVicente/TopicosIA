DESCRIPTION:

Event buffers should be @Beans to make them replaceable

If an application defines new model events (e.g. TableEvent), it should
be possible to change the corresponding event buffer logic accordingly.
This was not easily possible, because each model instance created its
own event buffer instance in a createEventBuffer() method. Because this
method is not included in the extension chains, it would be very
cumbersome to override this method on each use of the model class.

Instead of creating a new instance of an event buffer using the "new"
keyboard, the new instances are now created via BeanManager. This allows
to replace the implementation globally.
