DESCRIPTION:

HtmlComponent: prevent wrong size measurements during opening animation

When the layout of a component is validated while one of the parents is
currently running a CSS animation, the measured sizes might be wrong,
because the browser sometimes returns mid-animation values.

Example:
A popup with a list box is opened with a "fade in and grow" animation.
While the animation is running, the list box's lookup call has loaded
the data and inserts the corresponding table rows. This causes the table
layout to be revalidated. Because the visible size on screen is
currently smaller than the defined CSS size, the table will sizes
incorrectly.

To fix this, the layout process has to be postponed until the animation
is complete. There is already a similar check in HtmlComponent.validate-
Layout() that deals with invisible parents. A similar check was added
for animations. Because the component being layouted might be anywhere
inside the animated parent, all parents up to the DOM root have to be
checked.

The name of the CSS class used to detect the animation on any parent is
hard-coded and is set to the generic name 'animate-open'. Currently
Popup.js is the only widget that makes use of this concept.
