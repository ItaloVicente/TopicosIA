DESCRIPTION:

Table: collapsing not possible when child rows are updated

If a child row is updated while the parent row is being collapsed,
the child row won't be removed and still visible -> collapsing
does not work.

If the child row is updated while the parent row is being expanded,
the animation would stop immediately -> expanding works but without
animation.

The first issue can be fixed easily, the second case can be fixed for most
cases. Sometimes there won't be an animation, sometimes the animation
will start twice (depending on the network latency, if the row update
happens in a selection handler on the server).
