DESCRIPTION:

Enable MessageBoxes to show even on collapsed Outline.

Previously, a collapsed outline led to the situation where a MessageBox
with the Outline as its displayParent was only rendered if that
displayParent was visible (which it wasn't). Now, we check if its
displayParent can show a view (via acceptView). Regression test also
added.
