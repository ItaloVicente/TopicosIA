DESCRIPTION:

Fix various issues concerning popups, page reload & glasspanes

Popups don't have GlassPanes:
Popups are painted outside of the widget parent-child DOM hierarchy.
That's why the current GlassPanes have no effect on Popups.
-> Added Popups as glassPaneTargets

Layouting the MenuBar removes/renders the menuItems:
When removing a menuItem which is a ContextMenuPopup the glassPane div
is lost.
-> Check for active glassPanes in the postRender of the Popup and
rerender the glassPanes if necessary.

MessageBoxes/FileChooser loose the correct displayParent after refresh:
The displayParent property is not a model property but is only set by
the show/activate event. After a page reload with a open
MessageBox/FileChooser the displayParent is undefined. Set it according
the the Controller's displayParent as this is done with Forms as well.
