DESCRIPTION:

Checking tree node by model should not automatically check its children

In a tree with property autoCheckChildNodes checking a node
automatically checks all its children. When then a child node is
unchecked and the site is reloaded the unchecked node gets checked again
because its parent node is checked.

When synchronizing the values from the model to the tree only the nodes
that are checked in the model should get checked in the tree.
