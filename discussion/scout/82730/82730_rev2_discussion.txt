DESCRIPTION:

Store urlHints as cookie to support dev mode on login form

Before the user is logged in, there is no HTTP session. Therefore, the
URL hints cannot be stored, and consequently, the login form does not
support "debug mode". To fix that, the URL hint state is no longer
stored in the HTTP session. Instead, a cookie is used.
