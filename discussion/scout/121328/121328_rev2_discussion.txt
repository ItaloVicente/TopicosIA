DESCRIPTION:

scout.styles: add functions to apply legacy styles individually

legacyStyle() applies foregroundColor, backgroundColor and font at the
same time. However, when a field property changes, only the
corresponding style should be updated. To accomplish this, three methods
were added to scout.styles that are called internally by legacyStyle(),
but may also be called individually.

This fixes wrong styles on Buttons when multiple properties are set and
changed, e.g. foregroundColor and backgroundColor.

Additional fix for Button.js: set foreground color to icon and
submenu-icon as well.
