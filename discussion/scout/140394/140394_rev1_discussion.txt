DESCRIPTION:

JMS/MOM: connection failover

Add connection failover
Add MOM.subscribe wait-for-ready

Connection failover is achieved using a connection wrapper and a session
wrapper around the real jms connection and session. Connection loss is
discovered with (jms)connection.setExceptionListener. J2EE jms providers
are excluded since those do failover themselves.

The main goal of connection failover is to maintain subscription
listeners. All session wrapper methods do a one-time retry in case of
failure. Default connection failover tries to reconnect 15 times every 2
seconds.

Subscription listeners are not stopped when the connection is dropped.
However thy try to receive messages again and again until the connection
is restored or the session is closed by custom code.

Another improvement with similar scope is the subscription process
itself. When calling MOM.subscribe the call is blocked at maximum for 30
seconds in order to wait for the subscription event loop to effectively
start waiting and receiving messages. That way it cannot happen anymore
that in the snippet
MOM.subscribe(...) -> schedules a event loop job
MOM.publish(message)
the message is published BEFORE being received from the subscriber due
to latency in starting the background job.

Configuration:
There are 3 new config.properties defined in IMom and IMomImplementor
- scout.mom.failover.connectionRetryCount default 15
- scout.mom.failover.connectionRetryIntervalMillis default 2000
- scout.mom.failover.sessionRetryIntervalMillis default 5000

Migration:
The interfaces and api are still stable, however customized jms code
must check if some of the following old types/methods are being used or
accessed:
- method with IJmsSessionProvider.getSession() now throws JMSException
- check override of JmsMomImplementor.createConnection() and
postCreateConnection() so they do not call
connection.setExceptionListener(...)
- check override of IJmsSessionProvider, JmsSessionProvider since these
are wrapped in the new JmsSessionProviderWrapper
- do not use JmsMomImplementor.m_connection and directly since during
reconnect the member gets null and changes.

Test:
JmsMomImplementorTest.testSubscribeFailover

Thank you, Ivan!
Line:23, /COMMIT_MSG -> "thy" -> "they"

Line:52, /COMMIT_MSG -> Remove superfluous "and"

Line:58, /COMMIT_MSG -> Remove word "Reference:"

Line:258, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/api/IMom.java -> Why semicolon? Better use full stop.

Line:259, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/api/IMom.java -> Isn't it required to have the possibility to set this to "infinite", e.g. -1?

What happens after the retry count has been reached? Wouldn't we end up with a broken implementor again? In any case, it would be worth to describe this here, because I think it's not obvious from looking at the code.

Line:265, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/api/IMom.java -> Shouldn't this be 6.1, as this change is for 6.1.x branch? (Same for all other occurences of @since.)

Line:67, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/api/IMomImplementor.java -> I would not mention the default value here (it is specific to the config property only).

Line:13, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.jms/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/jms/IJmsConnectionFunction.java -> Maybe use a more descriptive name:
- ICreateJmsConnectionFunction
- IJmsConnectionCreator

Line:36, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.jms/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/jms/IJmsSessionProvider.java -> "references to this value"

Line:178, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.jms/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/jms/JmsMomImplementor.java -> Remove unnecessary "throws JMSException" (Sonar)

Line:254, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.jms/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/jms/JmsMomImplementor.java -> Should this timeout be configurable as well?

Line:626, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.jms/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/jms/JmsMomImplementor.java -> Remove unnecessary "throws NamingException" (Sonar)

Line:24, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.jms/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/jms/internal/IJmsSessionProviderEx.java -> Maybe use a better (more descriptive) name?
- IFailoverJmsSessionProvider
- IJmsSessionProviderWithFailover

Line:26, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.jms/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/jms/internal/IJmsSessionProviderEx.java -> param is not called "input", remove or fix

Line:35, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.jms/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/jms/internal/IJmsSessionProviderEx.java -> @return

Line:43, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.jms/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/jms/internal/JmsConnectionWrapper.java -> I assume this only used because there is no ConcurrentHashSet, right? Small comment would make this clear.

Line:22, org.eclipse.scout.rt.mom.jms/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/mom/jms/internal/JmsSessionProviderMigration.java -> Documentation? I don't understand the name of this class, why is it called "migration"? Why is it even required? It only has a static method that cannot be overridden anyway.

Either remove it or convert to helper (and rename it)
