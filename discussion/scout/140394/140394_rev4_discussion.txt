DESCRIPTION:

JMS/MOM: connection failover

Add connection failover
Add MOM.subscribe wait-for-ready

Connection failover is achieved using a connection wrapper and a session
wrapper around the real jms connection and session. Connection loss is
discovered with (jms)connection.setExceptionListener. J2EE jms providers
are excluded since those do failover themselves.

The main goal of connection failover is to maintain subscription
listeners. All session wrapper methods do a one-time retry in case of
failure. Default connection failover tries to reconnect 15 times every 2
seconds.

Subscription listeners are not stopped when the connection is dropped.
However they try to receive messages again and again until the
connection
is restored or the session is closed by custom code.

Another improvement with similar scope is the subscription process
itself. When calling MOM.subscribe the call is blocked at maximum for 30
seconds in order to wait for the subscription event loop to effectively
start waiting and receiving messages. That way it cannot happen anymore
that in the snippet
MOM.subscribe(...) -> schedules a event loop job
MOM.publish(message)
the message is published BEFORE being received from the subscriber due
to latency in starting the background job.

Configuration:
There are 3 new config.properties defined in IMom and IMomImplementor
- scout.mom.failover.connectionRetryCount default 15
- scout.mom.failover.connectionRetryIntervalMillis default 2000
- scout.mom.failover.sessionRetryIntervalMillis default 5000

Migration:
The interfaces and api are still stable, however customized jms code
must check if some of the following old types/methods are being used or
accessed:
- method with IJmsSessionProvider.getSession() now throws JMSException
- check override of JmsMomImplementor.createConnection() and
postCreateConnection() so they do not call
connection.setExceptionListener(...)
- check override of IJmsSessionProvider, JmsSessionProvider since these
are wrapped in the new JmsSessionProviderWrapper
- do not use JmsMomImplementor.m_connection directly since during
reconnect the member gets null and changes

Test:
JmsMomImplementorTest.testSubscribeFailover (242253)
