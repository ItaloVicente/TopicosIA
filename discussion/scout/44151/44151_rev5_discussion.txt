DESCRIPTION:

Key Stroke fixes -> consistent naming KeyStroke in camelcase.
Menus should not be treated in delegate of a new KeyStroke. They have
all keyStroke abilities from the superclass AbstractAction.
Removed ContributedKeyStroke Method from all FormField classes because
this are only the menues which are added on the field.-> use getMenus()
instead.
