DESCRIPTION:

Session.js: Improve offline behavior for bad connections

To improve the user experience when the connection to the UI server is
bad (i.e. single requests fail sporadically), failed requests should be
tried again before failing ultimately and putting the session in
"offline" mode.

AjaxCall.js:
Provides a promise that is resolved when the ajax call has succeeded. If
this required more than one try is transparent to the caller. The
promise is resolved if the call failed even after multiple retries.

Reconnector.js:
This object was extended to not only ping the server while being offline
but also when a call failed while being online. The same pattern is
applied: Try to ping the server multiple times (configurable intervals).
If the ping succeeds, a ?sync request is sent to the server to get any
missed responses. Then, the first call is performed again.

UiSession.java:
The response history is now a separate object (ResponseHistory).
