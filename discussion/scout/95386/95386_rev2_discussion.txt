DESCRIPTION:

437912: Storing form with wrappedFormFields as XML leads to wrong output 

Wrapped forms were visited twice, once by the AbstractWrappedFormField
(intended) and again by the exporting form field visitor (unintended).
Hence fields of wrapped forms were added twice to the resulting xml
document, once within the wrapped form context and once on top-level.

XmlUtility child elements lookup operations by name used the recursive
org.w3c.dom.Element.getElementsByTagName(String) method. Inner fields
were handled twice, once in the wrong outer form context.
