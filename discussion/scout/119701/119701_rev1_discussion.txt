DESCRIPTION:

ClientNotificationPoller adds cancellable which is never unregistered

Previously in commit 55768b274d8e2a94971af5a23cde882e4fc7e22f a new
RunMonitorCancellableProcessor was introduced to just register the run
monitor to its parent during the actual run (and unregister it
immediately afterwards).

This changed the behaviour of the JobFutureTask as it was not cancelled
immediately anymore the parent run monitor was cancelled (if it was
cancelled before the actual run), now its run monitor is cancelled
during the callable chain of the future. In the past the future was not
run if the parent run monitor was cancelled prematurely.

To maintain this behaviour with the new RunMonitorCancellableProcessor
an additional callable chain interceptor (and corresponding test) is
introduced which stops the callable chain if the run monitor is
cancelled.

Line:113, org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/platform/job/internal/JobFutureTask.java -> Why is this done in an extra method while the next is done inline? In general an overridable method call in a constructor is considered to be bad practice.

Line:113, org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/platform/job/internal/JobFutureTask.java -> It is moved to constructor now, see current patch set from this morning. This is not an acceptable solution?

Line:113, org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/platform/job/internal/JobFutureTask.java -> I have seen this. Of course this is ok. I think there are 3 options:
1. In the constructor as it is now
2. private method
3. protected static method

You can decide which to prefer.

Line:113, org.eclipse.scout.rt.platform/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/platform/job/internal/JobFutureTask.java -> Thanks for the listing, if all three options are equal or almost equal I would choose the first option as it is already inlined into the ctor in the current patch set.
