DESCRIPTION:

DetachHelper: Fix incorrect use of $.extend()

This fixes a bug caused by accidental override of default options.
Because $.extend() alters the first argument when combining two objects,
this._defaultOptions can be changed permanently, although the user only
expected the options to be valid for a single call to beforeDetach().

How to reproduce:
- Open a form with a tab box
- Put the focus on a field on the first tab and click the outline to
  detach the form.
- Click on the form view tab -> focus is restored on the same field
- Now select a different tab and put the focus on a field in this tab.
- Click the outline and return to the form -> Focus is not restored
  correctly. In fact, this behavior is now broken altogether (the focus
  is always put in the first field).
