DESCRIPTION:

Desktop: always bring outline to front when activated

When a different outline is activated, the desktop will usually bring it
to front automatically. However, when a form is currently activate and
the outline to activate is already selected, the outline would not come
to front. To make sure the behavior is the same, the corresponding
"outline content activate" event is fired manually.
