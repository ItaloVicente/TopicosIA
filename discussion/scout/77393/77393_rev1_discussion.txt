DESCRIPTION:

Added input stream reader that removes possibly available BOM

Unicode uses a byte order mark (BOM) for detecting the endianness of
the encoded stream. The character \ufeff represents the BOM, but only,
if it appears at the beginning of a stream. Within the text it
represents a ZERO WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE ZWNBS (it is strongly
recommended to use another character within the text for expressing the
same semantics, but ZWNBS is still supported).

The BomInputStreamReader transparently removes the BOM from unicode
streams. UTF-32 as well as other encodings is not affected by the
implementation.

Added comment to CsvHelper, that it should be used with a
BomInputStreamReader. Also made CsvHelper using its getters instead of
directly accessing its fields.
