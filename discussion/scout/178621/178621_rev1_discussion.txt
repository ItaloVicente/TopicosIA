DESCRIPTION:

Outline: too many nodes visible sometimes when table is filtered

If a row is inserted or updated that won't be visible due to an
 active filter, the node linked to that row must stay invisible as well.

Insert issue
  The filter event triggered in insertRows() is only fired if the
  visible rows change which is not the case.
  This fails only in Scout Classic. With Scout JS the OutlineMediator
  mediates the insert event to the outline which correctly applies
  the filters.

Update issue
  The update event triggers row init which is handled by the
  OutlineAdapter. That handler applies the outline filters.
  Since at that time row.filterAccepted is still true (default value),
  the DetailTableTreeFilter will accept the node which is wrong.
  -> The filter is triggered too early, in fact, this code is obsolete,
  because Table.updateRows() triggers a filter event itself
  that will be propagated to the Outline by OutlineMediator.js.
