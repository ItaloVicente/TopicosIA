Line:27, eclipse-scout-core/src/desktop/outline/pages/PageTileGrid.js -> Set withPlaceholders to false

Line:15, eclipse-scout-core/src/form/Form.less -> This changes every menubar on the tile dashboard. Maybe there are tiles containing a menubar that should have a background-color -> Select menubar of root group box explicitly

Line:224, eclipse-scout-core/src/style/sizes.less -> Not sure about that... If we want to make it bigger we should probably adjust the bench padding

Line:124, eclipse-scout-core/src/table/Table.less -> Is tile-dashboard not always active in tile mode?

Line:17, eclipse-scout-core/src/tile/PlaceholderTile.less -> a tile is not a popup...

Line:17, eclipse-scout-core/src/tile/fields/FormFieldTile.less -> Why is this necessary? Placeholder tiles don't have the dashboard class

Line:362, eclipse-scout-core/src/tile/fields/FormFieldTile.less -> Do we still need this? Wouldn't it be easier and consistent to always use box shadow as selection?

Line:376, eclipse-scout-core/src/tile/fields/FormFieldTile.less -> Don't use descendant selector if not really necessary, tiles are direct children of a tile grid.

Descendant selector is slower and could also create side effects (if a tile contains tiles...)

Line:396, eclipse-scout-core/src/tile/fields/FormFieldTile.less -> What is this use case?

Line:397, eclipse-scout-core/src/tile/fields/FormFieldTile.less -> Same rule as above?

Line:12, eclipse-scout-core/src/tile/fields/FormFieldTile.less -> Why is border still needed?
One of the new styles should be the new default. We don't need a third style.

And:
- Title of page tile grid can be removed. Maybe show it if navigation is hidden
- If navigation is hidden, the view button has the wrong color if a dashboard or outline overview is shown.
Line:224, eclipse-scout-core/src/style/sizes.less -> Also, first menubar button is not aligned anymore. Better remove it, we can change it globally if needed later on.

Line:26, eclipse-scout-core/src/tile/fields/FormFieldTile.less -> Better override the style in PlaceholderTile.less and don't use :not here. :not selector makes it mostly more complex, so use it with care. Also, if someone wants to adjust the style he needs to copy & paste the complex rule.
