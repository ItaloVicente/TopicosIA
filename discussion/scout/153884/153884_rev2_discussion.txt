DESCRIPTION:

Added HTTP header X-Content-Type-Options nosniff

The X-Content-Type-Options response HTTP header is a marker used by the
server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type
headers should not be changed and be followed. This allows to opt-out of
MIME type sniffing, or, in other words, it is a way to say that the
webmasters knew what they were doing.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options
