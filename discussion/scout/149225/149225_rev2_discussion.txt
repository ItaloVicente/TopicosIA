DESCRIPTION:

jquery-scout: simplify isVisible() (make consistent with setVisible)

isVisible() used the private function elemVisible() to read the computed
style of the 'display' property and compare it to the value 'none'. This
was done for historic reasons, but had some problems:
1. When an element has the 'hidden' CSS class set but is not attached
   to the DOM, isVisible() returns true (because the value of the
   display attribute is returned as '').
2. It is not consistent with setVisible(), which only toggles the CSS
   class 'hidden'. So even when setVisible(true) was called, isVisible()
   should still return false, when the style is set accordingly.
3. Reading the computed style is much slower than just checking for a
   specific CSS class.

To make the behavior consistent, faster and more 'Scout-like', the
implementation is changed to just check for the CSS class 'hidden'
(which is defined in main.less).
