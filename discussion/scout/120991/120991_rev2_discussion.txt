DESCRIPTION:

fix enabled bug

in Form.js the enabled Method of Widget.js was overwritten with another
set of input parameters. Therefore the whole form was set as enabled
when one tries to set only one Field as enabled. The convenience method
"enabled" in Form.js isn't needed any more, since it is now available in
the super class Widget.js.
