DESCRIPTION:

ClipboardField: Support text paste with disabled ClipboardAccess in IE

The ClipboardField had already a fallback method to get pasted image
content when the onPaste-event-data is empty (which will happens when
“Allow programmatic clipboard access” in IE is disabled for the security
zone of the scout application. An onPaste-event will still be fired, but
there is no way to get the clipboard content from the event-data). This
change adds the capabilities to deal with text content on the fallback
method.
