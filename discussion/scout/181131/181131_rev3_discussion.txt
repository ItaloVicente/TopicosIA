DESCRIPTION:

jquery-scout: fix oneAnimationEnd() for nested animations

Because "animationend" events bubble up, an event listener will also be
triggered when the animation on a child element ends. To prevent the
registered "oneAnimationEnd" handler to be notified too early, it is
only called when the event target matches the expected element. If the
event originated from a different element, the listener on the current
element needs to remain registered. Therefore, the listener has to be
registered with on() instead of one().
