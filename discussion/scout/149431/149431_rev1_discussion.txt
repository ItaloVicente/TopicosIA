DESCRIPTION:

Urlencode filenames in binaryResource: URLs

binaryResource URLs now contain urlencoded filename parts, i.e the
format is changed from:
 binaryResource:[fingerprint/]filename to
 binaryResource:[fingerprint/]urlencodedfilename

The methods in BinaryResourceUtility should be used for conversion:
- createUrl() to generate binaryResource URLs
- getFilenameFromUrl to extract the original filename from URLs

Specifically, the fingerprint and the following slash '/' are not
urlencoded, but the filename part is now URL encoded. This allows
running HTML content containing binaryResource URLs through HTML
processing regardless of the filenames of the linked resources, even if
they include forbidden characters such as double quotes. Only the
filename is urlencoded as there may be preexisting code that relies on
the fingerprint and following slash to be present unencoded.

Note: This change should not affect any hardcoded binaryResource: URLs,
unless they already contain '%' or '+' characters (which would be
changed upon url-decoding.
