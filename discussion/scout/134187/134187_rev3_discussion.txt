Line:2783, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/AbstractDesktop.java -> Remove this API, AbstractPopup can handle it.

Line:907, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/IDesktop.java -> this is the wrong number. But I think it is not necessary to have a popup api on the IDesktop, the AbstractPopup can handle it

Line:77, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/popup/AbstractFormPopup.java -> This is only necessary, if form is in the list of children. Since getChildren is missing, I don't think that is the case. But I suggest to implement getChildren() according to AbstractFormMenu#getChildren() to be consistent

Line:64, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/popup/AbstractWidgetPopup.java -> How to close a popup? Please add a close() function. Also: References need to be cleaned up on PopupManager, and JsonPopup needs to be destroyed which should automatically happen if the list of popups in PopupManager is modified.

Line:64, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/popup/AbstractWidgetPopup.java -> exec functions are never public. Rename to open() and move to AbstractPopup and IPopup

Line:54, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/popup/IPopup.java -> Is this used? Remove it

Line:746, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/popup/Popup.js -> Since you don't have any special logic in this function you can omit it, because the default does the same

Line:13, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/popup/PopupAdapter.js -> What if the popup is closed by the UI? The server needs to be informed. Currently it only works if a Form is used inside the popup, but if a plain widget is used it won't work. Please add a demo for a WidgetPopup and a FormPopup in the Widgets Application. A WidgetPopup can contain a simple Label widget, similar to the PopupForm.js in the JsWidgets

Line:12, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/popup/PopupManager.js -> What if you want to open 2 popups? I would suggest to rename this to popups

Line:28, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/popup/PopupManager.js -> Always prefer the setter. Why it is necessary to change the parent anyway?

Line:36, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/popup/WidgetPopup.js -> Why did you remove this? This is necessary

Line:20, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/popup/WidgetPopup.less -> This prevents having small popups. I think we should omit max-width too. It hardly depends on the use case.
