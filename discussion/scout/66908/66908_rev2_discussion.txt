DESCRIPTION:

re-initializing of extensible objects must run within extension context

Model extensions can be nested within other extensions, without
declaring inner classes static. Hence the enclosing class must be
available when the inner is created. This was already supported by the
extension registry.

In addition, some model objects re-initialize their children after the
initial setup. That's why the extension context must also be available
during partial object-hierarchy re-creations.
