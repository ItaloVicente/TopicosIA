DESCRIPTION:

Schedule immediately executing 'one-shot' jobs via executor service

It makes no sense for such jobs to have an additional thread context 
switch. This further reduces the load to Quartz Scheduler, which results
significantly in a better performance at high load. Also, this solves 
the problem of 'as-scheduled' permit acquisition for jobs scheduled 
from within a repetitive job.
