DESCRIPTION:

Make DoDateDeserializer/DoDateSerializer thread-safe

Observation: When many JSON requests are parsed in parallel, sometimes a
NumberFormatException ('for input ""') occurs. This was caused by the
user of the same SimpleDateFormat instance by multiple threads.
SimpleDateFormat is not thread safe, therefore a new instance should be
created for each thread.
