DESCRIPTION:

Finding the Form of a menu fails if the menu is in the ellipsis menu

When there is not enough space on a form to display all menus they are
collapsed in an ellipsis menu. When a collapsed menu is clicked the
"action" event is fired which closes the ellipsis menu. This means that
the menu entry loses its parent. So after the "action" event has been
fired the form can't be found anymore using Form.findForm because it
requires the widget's parent.

A solution for this is to find the form before the action event is
fired.
