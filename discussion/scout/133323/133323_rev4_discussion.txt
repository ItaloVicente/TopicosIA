DESCRIPTION:

Tests using a platform should wait until the platform is fully started

Added the GlobalTestingPlatform as default global platform. This special
platform checks if there are BEANS.get accesses before the platform is
fully started. In such a case the platform starting thread is blocked
until Platform.awaitStarted().

This is the thread that caused the platform initialization to start by
calling Platform.get directly or indirectly. Also a call to BEANS.get or
Jobs.schedule causes the platform to start.

It is assumed that this thread is the junit test main thread.
