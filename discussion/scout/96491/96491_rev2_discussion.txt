DESCRIPTION:

Use Maven dependency provided scope only for deployable artifacts

In Maven dependencies with the scope provided are not transitive.
This makes sense if a dependency is set to provided depending on the
environment.
Any artifacts that are not intended to be used in a certain environment
should not have the scope provided and are therefore now transitive.
