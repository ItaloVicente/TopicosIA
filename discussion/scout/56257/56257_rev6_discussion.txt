DESCRIPTION:

Smartfield, Bugfix: Always select unique entry for text search.

Previously smart fields may have not selected the (one and only) unique
entry, if the previous search result was a browse all result and the
second search result was unique.

Line:132, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/form/fields/smartfield/TableProposalChooser.java -> This line is actually intended - at least as far as I read the previous code.

Previously the same check was done in the isBrowseAll() method on the previous search result. In my opinion that method must not use the previous search result, otherwise in the first result after a wildcard search an unique result row won't be selected, in following results a unique result row would be selected. Even more confusing, a wildcard search after several non-wildcard results with an unique result row would select the one-and-only row (just the first search after the wildcard search again would not).

I believe the behavior (not to select an unique result) was only supposed to act on the wildcard search itself, therefore I kept this condition. Of course one could also decide to remove the wildcard search/isBrowseAll condition at all.

The rest of the method does not use the getSearchResult() [previous search result] method, instead it uses the search result provided as parameter [current search result]. By calling isBrowseAll() the method would indirectly access the previous search result.
