DESCRIPTION:

Bug 410306: Viewports containing a tab panel with lot of tabs cannot be
fully scrolled vertically.

Fixed the problem that the logical grid layout did not respect the
containers's dimension when calculating the preferred size. That's why
the number of tab rows in a tabbox could not be determined correctly
which resulted in a too small viewport.
