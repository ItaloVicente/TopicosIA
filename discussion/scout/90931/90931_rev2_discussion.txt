DESCRIPTION:

UiSession: Create adapter for client session after desktop start

Old: Create adapters, start desktop
New: Start desktop, create adapters

Optimization:
By creating and attaching the JsonAdapter to the client session _after_
the model desktop has been fully started, the property changes during
desktop start will not trigger any listeners in the JSON layer. Because
only the final state is transferred to the UI anyway, the listeners are
not yet necessary and no information will be lost.

[CP from 6.1.x]
