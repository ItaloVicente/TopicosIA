DESCRIPTION:

SmartField2: don't show clear icon when loading

When the user enters text while the smart field is loading the clear
icon will be shown. But: it is not layouted correctly and is displayed
on wrong position. Actually the clear icon should not be shown when the
field is loading otherwise the loading state is not visible anymore.

Additionally: loading is set to false whenever the user types some text.
This is not intended, the loading indicator should be visible whenever
the field is doing a lookup. The reason is the RemoteLookupCall: it
aborts the previous lookup before doing a new one.

Note: both issues don't happen on branch 8.0. Reasons:
1. The visibility of the clear icon is controlled using CSS and the
selector considers both, has-text and loading.
2. The loading state is not reset because the current lookup is aborted
by the field before the new lookup is scheduled, so the promise won't be
rejected.

See comments below.
Line:1085, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/form/fields/smartfield2/SmartField2.js -> I'd move this line into the if block too. I ran the Selenium tests with that change and they seem to be Ok.

Line:1087, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/form/fields/smartfield2/SmartField2.js -> Typo: missing 'k' in RemoteLookupCall
