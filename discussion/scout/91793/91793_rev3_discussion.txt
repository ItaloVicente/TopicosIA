DESCRIPTION:

AbstractListBox: Resync value to tree after validation

If the checked keys are changed during validation, the new list of
checked keys have to be re-synched to the table again.

A very similar fix was previously applied to AbstractTreeBox with commit
f4e54fc61c9428bbc43c4b26264576d5397a9937.
