DESCRIPTION:

Enable external link protection

If a Scout application opens a popup browser window and loads an
untrusted external site, this site gets a reference to the origin Scout
application using the 'window.opener' reference set by the browser.
The untrusted site is then able to load any other site or content in the
original browser window holding the Scout application. This allows to
load a phishing site to steal credentials or other sensitive information
of the victim. The victim may not notice that the original browser has
been modified.
To prevent this attack the opener reference is cleared for popups opened
using JavaScript. For links the additional attribute rel="norefferer
noopener" is added. Please note that this feature is not yet supported
by all browsers.
This affects:
- The URI open handler used by IDesktop#openUri
- The BrowserField which may be configured to open in a popup window
- Forms having the DISPLAY_HINT_POPUP_WINDOW
- The builder to create HTML links like <a href="...">
