DESCRIPTION:

DownloadHttpResponseInterceptor: Fix downloads errors in IE11

IE 11 cannot download files if the filename hint set in the
Content-Disposition header (both filename= and filename*=) contains
certain control characters.

This strips out all control characters in the range 0x00-0x1f.
Characters in the range 0x80-0x9f as well as 0x7f can be parsed by IE 11
and do not need to be removed.

Note that the control characters in ISO-8859-1 have the same values in
the Java UTF-16 string representation, thus removing them from the Java
string will also ensure that they will not be present in the final
header.

This also adds testcases for the current implementation.
