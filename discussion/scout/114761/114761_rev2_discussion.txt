DESCRIPTION:

Fix ConcurrentExpiringMap to consider TTL when targetSize is not set

- Fix unbounded memory usage when only TTL but no targetSize is set, now
entries are evicted on put, putIfAbsent, replace. Theses operations will
be slower if no targetSize is set.
- Fix division by zero in copy constructor
- Fix concurrency issue (NPE) in evictOldestEntries
- Do not call size() in every thread, only in the thread that
acquires the lock, as some ConcurrentMaps may have slow size()
implementations.
