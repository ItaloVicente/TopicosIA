DESCRIPTION:

Widget: enabledComputed is wrong when setEnabled is called in _init

In a Scout JS app, it is common practice to initialize the form state
in the function _init. If this is done for the enabled property,
e.g by setting this.setEnabled(false), the enabledComputed flag will
be wrong because recomputeEnabled() has already run.
-> Make sure recomputeEnabled runs after _init but before
this.initialized is set to true.
