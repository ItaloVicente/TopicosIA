DESCRIPTION:

Add TileOverview for PageWithNodes

TileOutlineOverview now works also with given child nodes and not just
with the child nodes of an outline, so you can use this overview for any
PageWithNodes.

Line:10, /COMMIT_MSG -> reformulate without "you" ("...so it can be used...")

Line:68, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/outline/pages/AbstractPageWithNodes.java -> Please re-use AbstractPage's m_flags2. It seems to be a large overhead to add an entire byte for only one flag. Maybe it is even okay to add the getters/setters to AbstractPage, too.

Line:33, org.eclipse.scout.rt.client/src/main/java/org/eclipse/scout/rt/client/ui/desktop/outline/pages/IPageWithNodes.java -> Please remove the empty line before }

Line:386, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/bench/DesktopBench.js -> Please check what happens when detailFormVisible, detailTileOverviewVisible and detailTableVisible are all true. Currently, there are navigation buttons that toggle between form and table. Will they now toggle between form, tile overview and table? Or are tile overview and tile mutually exclusive?

Line:3, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/outline/overview/TileOutlineOverview.js -> General comment (applies to all *.js files):
Please format the JS code manually before comitting -> [Ctrl-Shift-F].

Line:13, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/outline/overview/TileOutlineOverview.js -> Would 'title' be the better property name? Because the DOM element is namend $title as well (and the CSS class as well).

Line:14, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/outline/overview/TileOutlineOverview.js -> Please document somewhere that 'text' and 'nodes' are optional model properties.

Line:23, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/outline/overview/TileOutlineOverview.js -> If "model" defines a value, that value should always win. If a node page had the name "" (not very common, but possible), this code would automatically display the outline title instead --> confusing.

  if (model.text === undefined) {
    this.text = this.outline.title;
  }

Line:104, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/outline/pages/Page.js -> This is not optimal. Because there are a lot of pages, creating an entire TileOutlineOverview widget (that has more child widgets) seems too expensive. I think this needs to be created on-the-fly only when needed.

Line:106, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/outline/pages/Page.js -> It's a bit strange that "Outline Overview" is used for something that is not an outline...

Line:107, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/outline/pages/Page.js -> I think, the parent should be set to "this". For example, the parent-child relation is used when disposing widgets. Would the overview widget be destroyed when the page is destroyed?

Line:25, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/outline/pages/PageTileGrid.js -> The structure of this class and the _setOutline/_setNodes methods are a bit confusing. The methods are not simple setters, instead they have "install"/"uninstall" semantics. 

In the current state, the call to _setOutline() would call _setNodes with the outline's nodes. Then, the second call to _setNodes() would override them again -> unnecessary.

I suggest that _setOutline does *not* call _setNodes. Instead, before calling any of the methods, automatically set "this.nodes".

  this.nodes = this.nodes || this.outline.nodes;

Line:69, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/outline/pages/PageTileGrid.js -> Remove this, see comment above.

Line:76, org.eclipse.scout.rt.ui.html/src/main/js/scout/desktop/outline/pages/PageTileGrid.js -> If _createPageTiles() would be made null-safe, this method could be simplified and we would only call _createPageTiles/setTiles from one place:

  scout.PageTileGrid.prototype._setNodes = function(nodes) {
    this._setProperty('nodes', nodes);
    this._rebuild();
  }

  scout.PageTileGrid.prototype._createPageTiles = function(pages) {
    return (pages || []).map(function(page) {
      return this._createPageTile(page);
    }, this);
  };
