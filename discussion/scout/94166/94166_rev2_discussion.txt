DESCRIPTION:

SmartField Performance:

Problem: 
The ProposalChooserLayout tries to calculate the preferred width of
every column. Therefore it runs over every table cell resetting the
width css properties to calculate afterwards the preferred sizes.
Finally it has to restore the css properties again. This loops are
pretty expensive since the DOM reflows after every single cell css style
update.

Solution: 
Detach the smartfield popup content before editing css inline styles of
every cell and attach it after the batch modification again.
