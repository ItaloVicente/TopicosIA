Line:247, build.gradle -> Could you check if this name OK? I don't use it but it is probably good thing to fill this field. 

I've checked with spec here

Love the changes, but have some slight remarks that we want to look at before pushing.
Line:243, build.gradle -> the version is already defined in gradle.properties, I think you can just refer to the version without specifying it here again. So we only have to maintain it in one spot.

Line:244, build.gradle -> I think there is a git plugin as well which we can utilize, but this works for now.

Line:247, build.gradle -> I think we settled on "Couchbase Core IO" since the module is also called core-io

Line:225, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/AbstractGenericHandler.java -> gotta put a "." at the end and a new line between the returns :)

Line:37, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/DefaultCoreEnvironment.java -> What happens if for some reason that is not available? Should we pick a default value without the version so we dont break anything?

One more thing:

- Can you separate out the naming in the environment from the other parts?
Reason is that in the clients which override the core environment, we can then also override the name and basically identify it properly (scala client, java client,..)
