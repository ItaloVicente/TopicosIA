DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-567: Properly close ConfigEndpoints when service disconnects

Motivation
----------
While working on a related code-change, it was found that when an
endpoint disconnects it is properly removed from the states, but
when this service in total is disconnected (i.e. if the node is
removed) then the service sticks around, potentially leaving endpoints
connected when they shouldn't be.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset borrows some logic from the pooled service to make sure
that on-demand endpoints are properly managed and if a disconnect
command comes along they are also correctly shudown. This triggers
side effects in certain outstanding requests, for example it closes
http streaming connections properly.

Result
------
The ConfigService (the only one using the on demand service as of
now) correctly handles node disconnects during reconfiguration.

The change looks great, it would be good to also add to a couple of unit tests to verify if the endpoint state is changed to disconnected.
