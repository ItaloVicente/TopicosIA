DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-503: Switch to different snappy for compression.

Motivation
----------
Originally we've been using the snappy code from netty,
but since we found issues in both the encoder and
decoder side the stability of it has been in question.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset includes the new dependency, shades it
and uses it in the KV handler for snappy compression
and decompression.

Result
------
Correctly working snappy implementation, more confidence
in that it works properly in production.
