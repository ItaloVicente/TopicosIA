DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-184: Prevent race condition on topology change with >1 buckets.

Motivation
----------
When more than one bucket is open at the same time a race condition combined
with our "safety rescheduling" logic prevents the system from getting back
into a stable state.

The two configurations for the buckets race each other with the reconfiguration
logic and the operations always get rescheduled.

Modifications
-------------
The change is quite trivial in that the rescheduling logic is now only executed
as a fallback when the regular node could not be selected beforehand. This allows
the operations to pass while just to retry the subset which is affected by
the temporary topology difference between the config nodes and the actual
instantiated node list.

Result
------
More stable behaviour during rebalance when more than one bucket is open.
