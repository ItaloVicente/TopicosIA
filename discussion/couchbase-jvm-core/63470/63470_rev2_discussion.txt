DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-327: Fix SocketAddress cast in generic handler

Motivation
----------
The AbstractGenericHandler remoteHttpHost retrieves the SocketAddress
from the ChannelHandlerContext but it performs an unverified cast to
a InetSocketAddress. In some instances, most notably tests with an
EmbeddedChannel, the cast can fail.

Modifications
-------------
Added an instanceOf check before the cast, and using toString as a
fallback mechanism (which should only occur in testing situations
anyway, since when the remoteHttpHost method matters is when we are
communicating with a REST endpoint, so through a InetSocketAddress).

Result
------
No more unit tests failing due to a ClassCastException.
