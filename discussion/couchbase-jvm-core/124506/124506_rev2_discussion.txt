DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-833: Fix seed node management with external addrs.

Motivation
----------
Upon further inspection it has been identified that there
exists another issue with external addrs - the seed nodes
are not updated and applied correctly.

Modifications
-------------
As a result, this changeset makes a couple of modifications.

 1) The configuration provider is updated so that the seed
    nodes will not be updated to the "internal" representation
    but rather to the external ones if present. This makes sure
    that the list of seed nodes is consistent and not mixing
    different representations.

 2) The config provider is also modifies so that it will only
    ever apply the external network check if it hasn't been
    done already. It is not strictly necessary but it is also
    not needed to check again for each opened bucket. A
    synchronization block has been added to further prevent any
    races on the selection in the future, although it has not
    been identified to cause issues at this point.

 3) Changing the seed node strategy above had consequences on
    the loader infrastructure which also had to be modified. To
    not bootstrap into the "external" hostname again we need to
    try and map it to the internal representation if already
    present. This makes sure that on subsequent bucket open
    attempts, the existing configuratins are reused.

As you can tell from all of this, managing external addrs is
ab it of a pain but there is no way around that complexity
for now.

Result
------
Opening multiple buckets in alternate addr setups is more
resilient and picks up / loads from the right hosts.

Rubber-stamping to be honest - this seed nodes & AA stuff is pretty complex...
