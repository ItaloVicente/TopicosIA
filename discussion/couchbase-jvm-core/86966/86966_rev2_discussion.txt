DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1147: Sync support for health check API up to rfc

Motivation
----------
Compared to the experimental version shipped with 2.5.0,
there have been major changes into refactoring and unifying
the health check API towards the RFC.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset brings the diagnostics API in-line with
what is described in the RFC, mainly:

 - refactors naming and API towards diagnostics
   (away from health check)
 - adds id, sdk and other fields that are mandatory
 - fixes up test cases to match the spec

Result
------
The diagnostics command works as specified in the RFC,
higher level API needs to be modified to reflect that
as well.
