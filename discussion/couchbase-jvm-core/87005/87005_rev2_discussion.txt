DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-485: don't go temporarily below min pool size

Motivation
----------
The code as it worked before closed all idle sockets and then
had some code in place which would "refill" the sockets up to
the point where its at min level again.

While this is fine, we need to make sure to stay at least at
the minimum level, even if it means that some sockets are idle
longer than configured.

Modifications
-------------
The code change leaves everything in place, but adds another check
where a maximum removable quota is defined before iterating. If
the quota is reached, no further endpoints are to be removed even
if they are idle.

Since the pool is likely to be dynamic, those will be recycled
if not needed anymore later on.

Result
------
The minimum quota is respected on the idle timer, and also as a
result the service never goes into a DISCONNECTED state since
it will never reach 0.
