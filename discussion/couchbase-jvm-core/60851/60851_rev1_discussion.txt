DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-301: Avoid Class.getSimpleName() overhead on every request

Motivation
----------
It turns out that getSimpleName() on the class calls toString on it
which has garbage overhead.

Modifications
-------------
Since we have a limited number of possible operations that are performed,
it makes sense to cache the resulting string in a map (which doesn't need
to be sync) and avoid the toString() overhead. Since it is a small HashMap,
the get() lookup has a little bit of overhead, but it is small enough to
provide benefit over not creating the garbage on every request.

Result
------
Less garbage created on the IO thread on every request.
