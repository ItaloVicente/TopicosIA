DESCRIPTION:

WIP: enhanced errors

this thing works and adds it to the CouchbaseResponse but its behind XERROR
hello - need to check if thats intentional but shouldn't be tied to that
change anyways.

needs java-client integration too, and I think we may need to adapt CouchbaseException
as well by giving it somehow more info? not too sure...
