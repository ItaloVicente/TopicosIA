DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Improve clean up of threads used by the SDK

Take into account RxJava SchedulerLifecycle and the fact that in 1.0.15
RxJava can now clean up its threads properly.

Update CoreScheduler to reflect those changes (as seen also in RxJava's
EventLoopScheduler).

Improve cleanup of cb-io threads (netty's io pool).

Improve cleanup of PauseDetector threads (LatencyUtils latency metrics).

Added integration test to verify cleanup in a scenario closer to reality
that spawns threads in RxJava, Netty and LatencyUtils as well as SDK.
