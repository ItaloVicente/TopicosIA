DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-456: Use Deque instead of Stack

Motivation
----------
Stack is an older and more or less deprecated collections class
in java, and the JDK recommends moving to a Deque implementation
instead. This also has the benefit of not having to use a
synchronized datastructure where we don't need one, paying an
overhead possibly.

See https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Deque.html
for more details.

Modifications
-------------
One can use the Deque as a drop-in-replacement for the Stack since
it provides all the necessary methods. Test pass.

Results
-------
Use a more modern, unsynchronized datastructure instead of the old
Stack one.
