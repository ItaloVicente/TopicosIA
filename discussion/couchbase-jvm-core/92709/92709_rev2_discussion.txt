DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-525: Make sure compression only reads allowed slice

Motivation
----------
During bugfixing it was found that the compression code is only
allowed to read the readable bytes into an array and not just look
at the full array 1:1, especially if during buffer pooling other
chunks might be filled with other stuff.

Modifications
-------------
Write the readable bytes into a new array and use this for compression,
which cleans up subdoc issues as well as other test failures.

Result
------
Proper compression bytes are sent over the wire now.
