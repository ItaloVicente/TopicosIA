DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-338: N1QL parsing response without metrics

Motivation:
-----------
The query service now honors a request that says metrics should not be
included in the response. As a consequence, the QueryHandler should now
take that possibility into account.

Modifications:
--------------
The QueryHandler has been modified to work with a response where the
metrics section is omitted.

Added a "split at every position" test without metrics.

Results:
--------
Response without metrics is now supported by the QueryHandler.
