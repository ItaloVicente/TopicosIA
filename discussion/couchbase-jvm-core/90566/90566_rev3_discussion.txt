DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-513 Handle NPE on a bad host in connection string

Motivation
----------
The client will exit with a NPE if a connection string contains both
good and bad hosts.

Changes
-------
Connection string adds a static method that will check if the
hosts are resolvable. The older static method parseHosts and a list of
unresolved hosts is retained for unit tests.

Results
-------
The bootstrap continues successfully with bad hosts. The integration
test will be added in the client.

Line:52, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/utils/ConnectionString.java -> The field name `unresolvedHosts` and method name `unresolvedHosts()` are misleading because the hosts are not necessarily unresolved; any addresses that can be resolved, will be. Perhaps a better name would be `allHosts` or `hostsIncludingUnresolvable` ?

Line:135, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/utils/ConnectionString.java -> Would explicitly checking whether the address is unresolved be simpler than catching an NPE?

    /**
     * Returns a new list containing only those address from the given list that are resolved.
     */
    static List<InetSocketAddress> withoutUnresolved(List<InetSocketAddress> addresses) {
        List<InetSocketAddress> resolved = new ArrayList<InetSocketAddress>();
        for (InetSocketAddress address : addresses) {
            if (!address.isUnresolved()) {
                resolved.add(address);
            }
        }
        return resolved;
    }

Line:174, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/utils/ConnectionString.java -> Worth some Javadoc indicating this only returns the subset of addresses that are resolvable?

Would it be good to log a warning when ignoring an unresolvable address?

Line:52, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/utils/ConnectionString.java -> Yes maybe allHosts is better, thanks, I'll change that.

Line:135, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/utils/ConnectionString.java -> I wanted to capture the NPE to log explicitly as it is an error that we couldn't resolve it.

Line:174, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/utils/ConnectionString.java -> Definitely, will add that.
