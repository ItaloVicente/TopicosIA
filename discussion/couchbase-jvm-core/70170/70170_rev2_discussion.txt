DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-375: extract SSL related settings into SecureEnvironment

Motivation
----------
JDCP connector (and probably other core-io integrations) are not able to
use SSLEngineFactory without implementing full CoreEnviornment inteface,
which might be overkill.

Modification
------------
Extract SecureEnvironment into separate interface, and inherit it by
CoreEnvironment. SSLEngineFactory now accept only SecureEnvironment.

Result
------
DCP client now can reduce codebase by reusing SSLEngineFactory from core.
