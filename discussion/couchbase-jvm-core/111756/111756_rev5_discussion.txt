DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-702 Test failures when using mock

Motivation
==========
We run the tests against the mock, and all of them should pass.  A couple
don't, due to limitations in the mock.  Also, -DuseMock=true|false should
work, and seems not to.  That's bad - complicates the interpretation of any
integration tests, etc...

Modification
===========
The 2 tests need to be aware that a mock is being used, and not ask for things
the mock doesn't support.  Also, we expose useMock as a property in the pom, which
the maven resources plugin then pops in the expected spot in the properties file.  This
allows -DuseMock to work.
