DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-289: One result / cmd on subdoc multimutate

Motivation
----------
Change to the subdocument protocol during development introduced the
notion of individual results in a multi-mutation. For now only commands
that return a value include a result (so the binary message could have
between 0 and N individual results).

Modifications
-------------
Renamed LookupResult to MultiResult and made it accept either a Lookup
or a Mutation as the operation.
This is now used by both MultiLookupResult and MultiMutationResult.

When decoding the multi mutation response, also recreate a MultiResult
for individual commands that didn't get an explicit result in the msg
so that list of commands and list of results are the same size.

Result
------
MultiMutationRequest can be made and including a COUNTER command will
have the new counter value in the response.
