DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-529: Expose original mutation cas on observe exceptions.

Motivation
----------
When running a mutation with PersistTo/ReplicateTo and the actual
mutation succeeds but the observe fails, it makes sense to expose
the original CAS value so it can be used for further processing.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset slightly extends the current exceptions raised
during the observe phase and extends them with the cas value
from the original mutation. Since the exception can be thrown
in non-mutation cases (read from replica) the cas will be
0 in this case - the javadoc mentions that fact.

Result
------
Exceptions during the observe phase expose the cas value
where possible from the original mutation.

Looks good except isn't the preferred Observe mechanism seq numbers rather than cas now?  (I'm new, could be wrong!)

Line:30, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/DocumentConcurrentlyModifiedException.java -> This will make this core incompatible with older releases.  Not sure if that's a big deal or not, but it could start to be with other things on top (Kafka+JDCP).

Alternative would be to allow the CAS to be null I guess when using the other ctor.

Line:39, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/DocumentConcurrentlyModifiedException.java -> Not a big deal I guess, but the ambiguity here and rules with CAS aren't pretty.  One alternative could be IllegalStateException if not set, since it's defined as a primitive.  Hm.  Just a thought.

I'm not confident of my UX thoughts on the API here, so discount them appropriately.  Or argue against me. :)

Line:43, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/DocumentConcurrentlyModifiedException.java -> This method is present in 3 different exceptions. Would it be useful for them to implement a common interface?
