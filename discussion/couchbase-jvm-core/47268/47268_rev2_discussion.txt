DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-137: Correctly create services from nodesExt if exposed.

Motivation
----------
Since in the upcoming release nodes can have distinct services, the
code needs to make sure to properly grab the services for each node
in the cluster.

Modifications
-------------
Previously the logic was a little bit mixed up, now the service
selection is clearly defined:

	- When nodesExt is available, use it exclusively.
	- If not, fall back to the regular nodes list.

In addition, the "viewUri" has been removed from the external
interface because it is not needed at all.

Result
------
The core now properly picks up distinct per node exposed services.
