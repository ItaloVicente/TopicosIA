DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-188: Add authentication headers for query.

Motivation
----------
Since the query service now supports authentication, the client
needs to send the appropriate headers.

Modifications
-------------
Similar to views, the query service extracts the bucket and password
from the query and builds the HTTP BASIC AUTH header required.

The test has been modified to assert that the header is present.
Since the idle state message doesn't have an auth header, it is
omitted and doesn't add one.

Result
------
Password protected bucket support for the query service.
