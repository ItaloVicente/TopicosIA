DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-119: utility class for common ByteBuf ops

Motivation
----------
We often need to perform the same operations on ByteBufs, like release.
This class allows to centralize such common operations, especially in
the context of applying them in Rx streams.

Modifications
-------------
New Buffers utility class, with an Action1 implementation that allows
to release ByteBufs in a Rx stream.

Result
------
Less overhead when applying common operations on ByteBuf in some cases.
