DESCRIPTION:

Current Java Core SSL implementation relies on Oracle's SunX509 algorithm. This prevents use of smart client in certain application deployment servers (i.e. IBM WAS uses IBM JRE). I propose using provider agnostic algorithm; since all JREs must support standard PKIX algorithm, smart client could safely utilize underlying PKIX algorithm.

File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> I think your commit message was probably, unfortunately, poorly formatted by your IDE.  It's unfortunately all on one line.  

I'll leave it to @simon or @michael to work through it from here, but I thought I might mention that it's preferred to write a one line summary, then write motivation/modifications/result.  

The only requirement is the one line summary, but the rest really helps.

You can see what I mean here:

I'll review this (if nothing has changed since github PR it should be fine) and fix the commit message ;)
