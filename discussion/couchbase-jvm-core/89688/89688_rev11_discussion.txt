DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-505: Add field level encryption support

Motivation
----------
Support for encrypted fields. Add cryptographic algorithm providers and
key store providers implementations.

Changes
-------
 - Add key store provider pluggable interface.
 - Insecure key store for development, Jceks key store for supporting
   both symmetric and asymmetric keys as Jks supports only asymmetric
   keys.
 - Add cryptographic algorithm provider pluggable interface
 - AES-128 and AES-256 algorithm providers support. AES-256 is
   recommended but requires JCE unlimited strength policy files for use
   with older java versions like 6,7,8. AES-128 can be directly used without
   the additional policy files.
 - RSA algorithm provider support

Result
------
Simple key store tests for jceks and vault pass. The cryptographic
providers are tested in java-client.
