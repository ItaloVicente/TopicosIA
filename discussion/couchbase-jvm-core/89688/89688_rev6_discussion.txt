DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-505: Add field level encryption support

Motivation
----------
Support for encrypted fields. Add crytographic algorithm providers and
key store providers implementations.

Changes
-------
 - Add key store provider pluggable interface.
 - Insecure key store for development, Jceks key store for supporting
   both symmetric and asymmetric keys as Jks supports only asymmetric
   keys and Hashicorp vault product key store support.
 - Add cryptographic algorithm provider pluggable interface
 - AES-128 and AES-256 algorithm providers support. AES-256 is
   recommended but requires JCE unlimited strength policy files for use
   with older java versions like 6,7,8. AES-128 can be directly used without
   the additional policy files.
 - RSA algorithm provider support

Result
------
Simple key store tests for jceks and vault pass. The cryptographic
providers are tested in java-client.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> typo in cryptographic

Line:28, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/EncryptionCrytoProvider.java -> any reason it is prefixed with encryption? seems a bit redundant and there is also a decrypt method...

Line:30, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/EncryptionCrytoProvider.java -> can you also add javadocs to these interface methods please?

Line:40, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/HashicorpVaultKeyStoreProvider.java -> I don't think we should ship this keystore provider by default for now.

Maybe as a separate module on maven? reason is that it adds another dependency (even if optional) and I'm not sure if we out of the box should have support for vault? 

If we have like a java-client-providers-extra or so..

Line:45, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/JceksKeyStoreProvider.java -> should the keystore be configurable?

Line:89, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/JceksKeyStoreProvider.java -> is this "production ready"?

Line:27, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/KeyStoreProvider.java -> which interface audience do we need on this?

Line:30, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/KeyStoreProvider.java -> there is a storeKey with both public and private, which getKey does this refer to? maybe it should be renamed to show the intent which ones is fetched?

Line:32, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/KeyStoreProvider.java -> adding some javadoc to these basic interface methods would be great if possible

Line:28, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/EncryptionCrytoProvider.java -> Sure, will fix.

Line:30, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/EncryptionCrytoProvider.java -> Yes

Line:40, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/HashicorpVaultKeyStoreProvider.java -> Yes, makes sense.

Line:45, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/JceksKeyStoreProvider.java -> Hmm, yes maybe read from an existing key store.

Line:27, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/KeyStoreProvider.java -> Store methods are public, whereas get is private audience. Will add it.

Line:30, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/KeyStoreProvider.java -> This is a private use method, will add the usage docs.

Line:32, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/KeyStoreProvider.java -> Sure

Line:89, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/JceksKeyStoreProvider.java -> Yes, the secret key entry wrapper just stores the raw key bytes. The algorithm is unknown at this point, maybe will rename it to Custom.

Line:33, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/AES256EncryptionCryptoProvider.java -> Seems like this code is identical to the 128 bit version, except for the key size. Is there an opportunity to reduce code duplication by having them both extend a base class, and specifying the key size in the subclasses?

Line:36, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/EncryptionCrytoProvider.java -> I'm wondering if any methods other than `encrypt` and `decrypt` actually need to be part of the interface. Seems like perhaps they're only used internally, or called when initializing the provider. What do you think?

Line:40, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/encryption/EncryptionCrytoProvider.java -> For the encrypt and decrypt method signatures, what do you think about changing `Object` to `byte[]`, and letting the caller add/remove the base64 encoding if appropriate?
