DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-410: Allow to configure the config polling interval.

Motivation
----------
At the moment the config poll interval is fixed to 10 seconds,
but it should be configurable.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset exposes the setting on the environment and makes
use of it in the CarrierRefresher. Note that when set to 0, it
is considered to be disabled.

Also, the interval cannot be configured lower than 2500
milliseconds to prevent the user from polling at a very high
rate all the time and potentiall overloading the system.

Result
------
Configurable poll interval, with the option to disable it if
needed.

Line:453, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/CoreEnvironment.java -> Should we make environment getter & setter for poll interval experimental, given more changes are coming for fast failover?

Line:453, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/CoreEnvironment.java -> I expected it to say like this because even if we change the interval later to 2.5s by default I think we still want to give the user the option to turn it back up to 10s or more again - wdyt? 

But lets make it experimental, we can always stabilize it with the 2.5.0 release later on :-)
