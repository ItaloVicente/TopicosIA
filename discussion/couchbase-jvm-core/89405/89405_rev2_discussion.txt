DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-500: Bump dependencies to latest bugfix releases.

Motivation
----------
As part of the regular bugfix dep bump, this change makes sure
all of our dependencies are up-to-date.

Modifications
-------------
Note that we previously would pass "null" into the channel promise
but in recent version a check has been put in place. Netty privately
packages a similar FailedChannel, but since its not publicly
accessible and a simple class this changeset just copies it over.

Result
------
Dependencies bumped.
