DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1206: Improve ring buffer diagnostics

Motivation
----------
When core-io's ringbuffer is filled, a BackpressureException is thrown
to the app.  This change is to provide some additional helpful
diagnostics in the exception.

Modifications
-------------
On adding a request to the ringbuffer, it's stored in the new
RingBufferMonitor class.  For lock-free performance, this class uses
a very simple approach of storing one AtomicInteger counter per
query type.

When requests are pulled from the ringbuffer, they are also removed
from the RingBufferMonitor.

If the ringbuffer ever fills, the BackpressureException raised now
contains additional diagnostics from RingBufferMonitor.

If this change is ok, I'll look at adding an API so that apps can query
the RingBufferMonitor at any point, and so monitor how close to
backpressure they are.

Special considerations for review:
- Is there a good place for the RingBufferMonitor to go, rather than
  having to be a singleton.
- I've had to not use the statically created BackpressureException,
  including some code that sets its stacktrace.  Unsure of the implications.
- Are the QueryTypes granular enough?
- Does it also need to be added to RetryHelper?  I think this is after the
  ringbuffer, but please confirm.

Result
------
Tested manually, as wasn't sure how to unit test this.  Counts are
increased and decreased as expected.

Line:41, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/BackpressureException.java -> NIT: Conventionally, fields are defined before methods. So this would go right at the top, before the constructors.

Line:44, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/tracing/RingBufferMonitor.java -> STYLE: Names of enum classes should be singular (in this case, QueryType instead of QueryTypes)

Discussion: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15755955/naming-of-enums-in-java-singular-or-plural

Line:75, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/tracing/RingBufferMonitor.java -> This form of the double-check locking idiom requires the instance field to be `volatile`. See https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/java/LCK10-J.+Use+a+correct+form+of+the+double-checked+locking+idiom

In this particular case, the instance is inexpensive to create and has no dependencies, so you might as well just initialize the singleton statically, like:

    private static final RingBufferMonitor instance = new RingBufferMonitor();

Line:104, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/tracing/RingBufferMonitor.java -> Lock-free performance is possible with a HashMap as well, if you prefer that solution. Since the map would not modified after creation, concurrent updates aren't an issue. Initialize the map in the c'tor and assign it to a `final` field so it's immediately visible to all threads. For extra peace of mind, (and to make your intent clear) you could wrap the map with Collections.unmodifiableMap().

Line:104, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/tracing/RingBufferMonitor.java -> Yep, and I can still go ahead and do this, but I wanted to keep this implementation as simple and performant as possible, as I don't want to pile any more bad stuff on if a backpressure situation is already happening.  I know a HashMap is hardly going to add any overhead though, and I'm happy to change to that if you prefer it.

Line:75, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/tracing/RingBufferMonitor.java -> Actually, if you know a better place for me to put an instance of RingBufferMonitor, rather than relying on a gross singleton, that would be even better.  I couldn't see an obvious place.
