DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1206: Improve ring buffer diagnostics

Motivation
----------
When core-io's ringbuffer is filled, a BackpressureException is thrown
to the app.  This change is to provide some additional helpful
diagnostics in the exception.

Modifications
-------------
On adding a request to the ringbuffer, it's stored in the new
RingBufferMonitor class.  For lock-free performance, this class uses
a very simple approach of storing one AtomicInteger counter per
query type.

When requests are pulled from the ringbuffer, they are also removed
from the RingBufferMonitor.

If the ringbuffer ever fills, the BackpressureException raised now
contains additional diagnostics from RingBufferMonitor.

If this change is ok, I'll look at adding an API so that apps can query
the RingBufferMonitor at any point, and so monitor how close to
backpressure they are.

Special considerations for review:
- Is there a good place for the RingBufferMonitor to go, rather than
  having to be a singleton.
- I've had to not use the statically created BackpressureException,
  including some code that sets its stacktrace.  Unsure of the implications.
- Are the QueryTypes granular enough?
- Does it also need to be added to RetryHelper?  I think this is after the
  ringbuffer, but please confirm.

Result
------
Tested manually, as wasn't sure how to unit test this.  Counts are
increased and decreased as expected.

The changes marked as "Done" don't seem to be reflected in Gerrit. Apart from that, I'm ready to +2 (I'm not familiar enough with the code to suggest a better place for the RingBufferMonitor)

couple items, looks good in general!
Line:26, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/BackpressureException.java -> I think you should override the toString here to include the diagnostics if available, so we have it in the logs.

Line:37, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/BackpressureException.java -> an you remove the get? we've been following the "fluent" style in general. .. also might be able to just use diagnostics() here?

Line:234, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/CouchbaseCore.java -> nit: you are getting the instance twice in the same codepath / hot code path .. might make sense to store it in a local variable

Line:29, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/tracing/RingBufferDiagnostics.java -> can you mark this class and API as volatile?

Line:44, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/tracing/RingBufferMonitor.java -> any reason why you added a new enum rather than using the ServiceType enum?

Line:67, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/tracing/RingBufferMonitor.java -> did you consider switching to the static init block as discussed on hipchat a while ago?

Line:85, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/tracing/RingBufferMonitor.java -> maybe initialize the map with the amount of put's so it doesn't go over the fill size (10 elements might make it go larger with the default fill size)

Line:105, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/tracing/RingBufferMonitor.java -> . BinaryRequest == KeyValueRequest, I  messed up at one point and renamed one but not the other

Line:120, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/tracing/RingBufferMonitor.java -> see above

toString doesn't get called when you print the stack trace. How about including the details in the exception message instead (passed to the superclass constructor).

Line:26, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/BackpressureException.java -> Ok, I've gone with:

Backpressure, ringbuffer contains QUERY=0 CONFIG=0 BINARY=0 VIEW=0 ANALYTICS=0 SEARCH=0 other=0 total=0

as I couldn't find any example toString output in the existing exceptions to copy.  I can tweak as needed, just let me know.

Line:67, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/tracing/RingBufferMonitor.java -> Yep, well I'd changed to David's suggestion of private static final RingBufferMonitor instance = new RingBufferMonitor(), but then messed up my git amend.
