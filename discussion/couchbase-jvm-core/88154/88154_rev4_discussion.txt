DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-488 NodeInfo returned by DefaultCouchbaseBucketConfig.nodeAtIndex() is missing SSL services

Motivation
==========
The DCP client calls DefaultCouchbaseBucketConfig.nodeAtIndex to determine
the port number to use for the KV service. When SSL is enabled,
this strategy fails because the returned NodeInfo does not have
info about SSL services.

(See JDCP-67 NPE in Conductor.masterChannelByPartition when SSL is enabled)

This happens because the DefaultCouchbaseBucketConfig constructor builds its
list of partition hosts using only the "nodes" field of the JSON config,
which does not have SSL info.

Modifications
=============
Modify DefaultCouchbaseBucketConfig constructor to use the
NodeInfo which the superclass constructor has augmented with
SSL service info.

Result
======
DCP client can get port numbers for SSL services by calling
DefaultCouchbaseBucketConfig.nodeAtIndex.
