DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-565: Proactively fetch config from http if signaled

Motivation
----------
Previously, when an http stream is attached to fetch a configuration
it has been trusted to always send a proper one in a short timeframe.
When the socket has been closed a new stream would be opened.

This does not account for the fact that a socket can end up in an
half/closed (dead) state and the client never knows that it has been
closed upon it. Since a dead socket is not distinguishable from a
socket where no config stream events are sent over, a new mechanism
needs to be added in order to return to a healthy state.

Modifications
-------------
Other sections of core-io already ask the config manager to grab
a new configuration because of specific heuristics (i.e. a socket
has been closed).

This code adds the behavior to the HttpRefresher which is very
similar to the CarrierRefresher. In fact, most of the code has
been copied 1:1. In a future change this will be refactored into
the common parent but for the sake of clarity we are not touching
the Carrier refresher for now (would be too confusing to review).

As soon as we get our hands on a new configuration the reconfig
logic of the SDK will jump in and clean up / restore a proper
state.

Note that this relies on an external signal from the heuristics,
which means it will go undetected until there is traffic. One
could argue that if there is no traffic also no impact will be
seen. The other approach that has been considered reopened
an idle http connection every x second interval, but this
heavily penalizes the common case for this edge case
scenario.

Result
------
We now properly handle a half/closed (dead) tcp socket where
the streaming connection is attached to.

Line:204, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> Despite your explanation to Dave I'm still struggling to see exactly when this happens.

'Note that this relies on an external signal from the heuristics,
which means it will go undetected until there is traffic. One
could argue that if there is no traffic also no impact will be
seen.'

But it also seems that traffic alone is not enough to guarantee this is called, e.g. something needs to go wrong such as a KV endpoint being disconnected by a downed node.  In the scenario we're trying to fix, with half-alive connections, that's not going to happen, no?

Line:210, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> Optional: config shadows the function parameter.

Line:218, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> Optional: I found allowedToPoll a little misleading as it suggests the bucket is allowed to poll *ever*.  isTimeToPoll maybe better.

Line:220, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> Optional: side effect in an FP filter() is a little uggo, would be neater if done in subscribe.

Line:226, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> Optional: Could use some comments.  Took me a while to figure out what the code in this chunk was doing, tbh.

Line:232, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> How often do you estimate this refresh is going to be called?  Could this (and other debug log lines) be spammy?

Line:250, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> What's this check for?  Simple sanity?

Line:204, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> experiments showed that it indeed helped: the only scenario where it would break down is if ONLY the http streaming connection is half-dead and a node is added to the cluster. In all other cases a kv socket would eventually be closed which would trigger this event.

Line:210, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> Ack

Line:218, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> agreed, we can change this in a refactoring later (since the other refresher is also affected)

Line:220, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> Ack

Line:226, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> Ack

Line:232, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> node list containing no nodes is basically something that I don't expect to happen at all. When we are refactoring this we might even turn it into a warning since it looks fishy

Line:250, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> yes, sanity. If the server returns something that is not json we want to ignore it

Line:204, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/HttpRefresher.java -> Ok this seems like a sensible change that will help, so I'll +2.  But I think I can see scenarios which this won't catch, will discuss at a less time-critical point.
