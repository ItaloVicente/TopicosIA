DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-277: Fix source relocation for netty memcache codec.

Motivation
----------
When moving from gradle to maven some part of the source shadow
relocation stopped to work subtly.

Modifications
-------------
The netty codec we ship is now properly excluded from the renaming
of the package locations. Note that this is done in a hacky way
because explicit exclusions did not do the trick (they were
ignored for some reason).

Result
------
Source jars now properly show the sources where the memcache
codec is used.
