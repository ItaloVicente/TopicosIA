DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-565: Detect dead tcp sockets on http config stream

Motivation
----------
When using memcached buckets, we are establishing an http streaming
conection to ns_server which pushes config changes to the sdk. If
no topology changes are going on, the streaming connection is silent
but kept open.

When the tcp connection is in a dead/half-closed state (server closed
but client never received a tcp close) then we cannot distinguish
between "no activity" and "dead and silent".

Note that "proper" tcp socket closes have been detected properly before
and are not affected.

Modifications
-------------
To remedy this situation, this changeset adds a read idle timer to
the netty pipeline which is configurable on the environment and
defaults to 30 seconds. When the connection is idle for longer than
this period, the channel is closed and the upper layer (HttpRefresher)
will open a new connection.

This pretty much guarantees a configurable upper bound until when
this happens a new configuration is loaded and the system returns into
a stable state. The downside is that even in a healthy system, each
interval a socket is closed and reopened.

In the future we might be able to tune these heuristics further, but
for now this seems like a good compromise between network activity
and failure recovery.

Result
------
Streaming connections now return to a healthy state with a deterministic
upper bound even in this edge case described above.

Line:35, /COMMIT_MSG -> I've a couple of questions:
a) How often would we expect ns_server to push a new config change to us.  Is it only when the config changes, or does it periodically send it to us?  If the latter is it < every 30 secs?
b) Is there any no-op/heartbeat/keepalive request we can make to ns_server to check the connection is ok, rather than the more expensive recreation of the TCP connection?
c) I've heard rumours of deployments with hundreds/thousands of app servers.  Is that going to be too expensive if they're all recreating this connection every 30 secs?  I'm not sure what the solution could be though.  Perhaps we should proactively contact customers we know are running large deployments to notify them about this new parameter and that they may want to adjust it for their setup.

Line:358, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/config/ConfigHandler.java -> Do want this at debug?  It'll add ~3k lines of log a day.  I don't have strong feelings on this, it just seems a touch spammy.

Line:609, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/env/CoreEnvironment.java -> Maybe worth commenting that <= 0 is disabled.
