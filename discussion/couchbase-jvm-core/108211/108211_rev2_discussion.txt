DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-657: Switch refresher selection logic to use the most effective one.

Motivation
----------
Right now the logic on how to select the refresher is very simplistic: if we
loaded the original config over http, it will use http for refresh. If it
loads through carrierit will use carrier for refresh.

Unfortunately, this is too simplistic: we might bootstrap off of a node in a
MDS environment where there is no KV service enabled, but throughout the
cluster there are. If it is a couchbase bucket and a modern cluster, it is more
or less a given. Using http refresh has a couple limitations and should not
be used if we can help it.

Modifications
-------------
As a result, this changeset contains a modification of the logic to select
which refresher is going to be used.

Instead of picking the same refresher as the loader, the code checks if it
is a couchbase bucket and a "modern server" (by checking for nodesExt in
the capabilities). As a result memcached buckets will still use the http
refresher, but in all other modern servers the code will now use the
carrier refresher even if we had to load through http.

Result
------
We can now switch to the carrier refresher (the most efficient and reliable
way to grab new configs) even if the user bootstrapped originally over
http, for example through a query-only node.

Nice improvement!
Line:186, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/AbstractBucketConfig.java -> Is this the first time we're exposing the bucketCapabilities field outside the class? Would this be a good time to switch it over to a Set, since the order doesn't matter and "contains" is the most common operation?

Patch Set 2:

If bucketCapabilities were a Set, the c'tor param could be annotated with `@JsonDeserialize(as = EnumSet.class)` to have Jackson use a set implementation optimized for enums. (Jackson excludes the null value from the EnumSet when READ_UNKNOWN_ENUM_VALUES_AS_NULL is enabled, so no problem there.)
