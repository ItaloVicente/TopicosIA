DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-258: Display warning if number of DCP too large

Motivation
----------
To simultaneously stream from large number of streams, the application
have to adjust RxRingBuffer.SIZE. Without it, the library will just wait
until current streams will complete, and only then it will go to the others.

Modification
------------
Check if the number of streams is too big to stream them simultaneously,
and log warning with advice to increase RxRingBuffer.SIZE.

Result
------
The library users will have ability to workaround missing DCP events.

I'm not sure what to make of it, I have less and less confidence in the use of Subjects and am not at ease with the infinite aspect of it
Maybe we can brainstorm live, Michael and Sergey?
