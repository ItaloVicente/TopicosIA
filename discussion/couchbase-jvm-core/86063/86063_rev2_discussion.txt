DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-480: Infrastructure for redacted logging.

Motivation
----------
To implement log redaction for the SDK, some
infrastructure needs to be added to the logging
implementations to support it.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds basic support by doing the
following things:

 - The CouchbaseLogger has been extended to support
   *redacted log variants that should be used when
   doing redacted logging.
 - The RedactableArgument type has been added which
   is used to wrap the argument so that the type
   is marked and then the code chooses to redact or
   not based on the RedactionLevel setting.
 - By default its turned off, but by setting the
   RedactionLevel on the CouchbaseLoggerFactory
   the value can be changed, usually during
   bootstrap.

Tests have been added to assert and regression test.

Result
------
Infrastructure for redacted logging is in place.

David, what do you think about that approach? see another changeset for how to use it, but I figured why bother with the env when we can configure it on the factory directly? Also, its global anyways and not bound to an env...

also, I opted for explicit logging methods otherwise we'd have to do it for every logger impl separately I think. Also it makes it a little more explicit (and I found it nice to grep for the codebase to see where its applied and where not)

I'm not crazy about having separate info/warn/error/Redacted methods; seems like it's too easy to forget to use them and end up leaking data that should be redacted.

What is the rationale for the separate methods?
Line:63, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/logging/AbstractCouchbaseLogger.java -> Aside:  it sure would be nice to have a "Objects.requireNonNull" analog in our toolkit.

Line:275, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/logging/AbstractCouchbaseLogger.java -> NIT: Maybe this default case would be a good place to throw the IllegalArgumentException?

Line:94, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/logging/RedactableArgument.java -> I'm worried future developers (including future dnault) will forget to call "infoRedacted" and will instead do something like:

    logger.info("User data: {}", user(something));

which would of course always log the user data. I wonder if it's better to err on the side of caution and have the toString method print a redaction message? (This is why I was thinking it would be good to have the "info" method handle redaction too.)

Yeah, thinking about it more I'll go the extra mile and live with a little more duplication but then its easier down the road. Let me fix it up

okay after starting over a couple times I think I have a strategy now how to deal with it. will work up the changeset and push it later.
