DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-480: Infrastructure for redacted logging.

Motivation
----------
To implement log redaction for the SDK, some
infrastructure needs to be added to the logging
implementations to support it.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset adds basic support by doing the
following things:

 - The CouchbaseLogger has been extended to support
   *redacted log variants that are used internally
   when doing redacted logging.
 - The RedactableArgument type has been added which
   is used to wrap the argument so that the type
   is marked and then the code chooses to redact or
   not based on the RedactionLevel setting.
 - By default its turned off, but by setting the
   RedactionLevel on the CouchbaseLoggerFactory
   the value can be changed, usually during
   bootstrap.

Tests have been added to assert and regression test.

Result
------
Infrastructure for redacted logging is in place.
