DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-677: Fix division by 0 in ConfigLocator

Motivation
----------
During shutdown there is a race condition which might trigger
a division by 0 in the config locator. It is not particularly
harmful, but still it needs to be cleaned up.

Modifications
-------------
the ConfigLocator now properly checks if the node list is empty,
and if it is performs a retry of the op. All the other locators
work as expected, but just in case regression unit tests have been
added.

Patch Set 3:

We will retry based on the retry strategy configured, so not necessarily 2.5s. When the client shuts down it won't retry it any longer. No, I don't know of a case where we would end up with an empty node list and even then retrying might be the best we can do.

Note that this is essentially what all the other locators also do at this point, I think not checking on the config locator was an oversight.
