DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-490: Add Snappy Compression Feature

Motivation
----------
As part of Couchbase Server Vulcan (5.5) it is possible to
negotiate compression between client and server which allows
the system to perform "end-to-end compression", reducing
network traffic and disk space.

Modifications
-------------
To make this supported inside the SDK, a couple of tasks
have to be accomplished:

 - Since the snappy class is not public in netty 4.0, the
   code has been copied over but apache 2 attribution is
   still in the header. Once we upgrade to 4.1 this can
   be removed.
 - The "snappy" feature is negotiated with the server, and
   if the server supports it the KeyValueHandler will use
   it.
 - During request encoding, the content will be compressed
   and the snappy bit is set in the datatype. Note that
   the uncompressed content is still kept around in the
   original message since it is possible that the request
   needs to be resent on a different channel.
 - On the decoding side we look for the snappy bit in
   the response and if set perform the decoding and free
   the original compressed buffer.

Result
------
If the server supports it, the client can now handle
end-to-end compression based on snappy and the
datatype bit in the kv protocol.

Cool stuff :-)
Line:310, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> Suggestion:

int toRead = Math.min(uncompressedContent.readableBytes(), Short.MAX_VALUE);

Q1: Why limit to Short.MAX_VALUE? 

Q2: Why do this is a loop? Will the output buffer end up containing multiple snappy documents? Might be good for the unit tests to check compression + decompression with a document that's longer than Short.MAX_VALUE.

Line:352, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> NIT: Looks like duplicated logic. Worth extracting a method that updates sets the content and updates the total body length?

Line:861, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> NIT: I'd recommend using "== DATATYPE_SNAPPY" or "!= 0" instead of "> 0" just to stay well clear of the edge case where the bitmask is a byte whose sign bit is set (for example, 0x80). When both operands are bytes, there's no widening conversion, and the result is -128, which is *not* greater than zero.

Doesn't make any difference in this case because DATATYPE_SNAPPY is not (byte) 0x80, but it's might still be good to get into the habit of avoiding "> 0" so as not to  get bitten when it *does* matter.

Line:881, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> NIT: Snappy DataType *bit* set ?

Line:30, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/util/Snappy.java -> If you want to avoid copying the Netty code, it looks like it's possible to create a public subclass of Netty's package-protected Snappy class. It would have to live in the same package, of course.

Line:861, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> or even

   return (datatype & DATATYPE_SNAPPY) == DATATYPE_SNAPPY;

Line:310, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> on the q's: this needs to be done because the snappy encoder works that way. i  first did it without it and it did blow up - then checked the snappy handler and saw its done this way.. now it works.

good point on the min and test, will add that to make sure.

Line:861, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> Done

Line:881, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> Done

Line:30, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/util/Snappy.java -> I thought about that, but I'd rather not mess around with our repackaging for that.. once we bump to netty 4.1 we can just straight get rid of it
