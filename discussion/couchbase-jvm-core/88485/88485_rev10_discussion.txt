DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-490: Add Snappy Compression Feature

Motivation
----------
As part of Couchbase Server Vulcan (5.5) it is possible to
negotiate compression between client and server which allows
the system to perform "end-to-end compression", reducing
network traffic and disk space.

Modifications
-------------
To make this supported inside the SDK, a couple of tasks
have to be accomplished:

 - Since the snappy class is not public in netty 4.0, the
   code has been copied over but apache 2 attribution is
   still in the header. Once we upgrade to 4.1 this can
   be removed.
 - The "snappy" feature is negotiated with the server, and
   if the server supports it the KeyValueHandler will use
   it.
 - During request encoding, the content will be compressed
   and the snappy bit is set in the datatype. Note that
   the uncompressed content is still kept around in the
   original message since it is possible that the request
   needs to be resent on a different channel.
 - On the decoding side we look for the snappy bit in
   the response and if set perform the decoding and free
   the original compressed buffer.

Result
------
If the server supports it, the client can now handle
end-to-end compression based on snappy and the
datatype bit in the kv protocol.

Line:302, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> but according to snappy code, compressed length might be bigger than uncompressed.
https://github.com/google/snappy/blob/master/snappy.cc#L73-L95

Line:324, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> it should not replace datatype, it only should modify the bit.

Line:338, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> will this byte buffer  be expanded automatically as uncompressed content is larger than compressed

Line:883, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueHandler.java -> It must remove snappy bit from the datatype
