DESCRIPTION:

Update mockito for testing.

Motivation
----------
When the tests are run with jdk 9+ the runtime complains about
illegal reflective access with our outdated version of mockito,
so this changeset upgrades it to the latest version.

Note: tests had to be modified because in mockito 1.x the anyString
matcher included null values while in 2.x it does not anymore.
the equivalent to this is nullable(String.class) which makes the
tests pass without changing its semantics.
