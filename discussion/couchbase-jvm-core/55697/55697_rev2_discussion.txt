DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-249: Do not fail if no services are configured for the bucket.

Motivation
----------
If no services are to configure for the bucket, the .last() method will
throw an exception, since the observable will not emit any events.

Modifications
-------------
To be more resilient to certain race conditions and state changes,
returning null in case there is no event emitted is fine and makes
sure the code is more stable under certain conditions.

Result
------
The code is more resilient to certain races that can happen.
