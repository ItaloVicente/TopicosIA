DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-87: Implement retry strategies, including fail fast.

Motivation
----------
Previously, requests were retried until they succeed. Sometimes a
fail fast retry strategy is needed in order to reduce the feedback
loop when operations cannot be fulfilled right away.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset refactors the retry strategy of requests and exposes
a generic RetryStrategy interface. By default "best effort" and
"fail fast" are provided, where "best effort" is the default and
resembles the previous behavior.

When "fail fast" is used, request observables are cancelled right away
and never retried, relying on the user to do so if needed.

In addition, users can implement their own strategies to even change
cancellation behaviour at runtime.

Result
------
More flexible and elegant way to configure and change cancellation/retry
behaviour.
