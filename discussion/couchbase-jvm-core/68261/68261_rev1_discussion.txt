DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-369: Gracefully handle empty partitions in bucket config.

Motivation
----------
If, for example during warmup, or for some other reason the bucket
config from the server does not contain partitions the code should
gracefully handle this case and send it into retry as it is done
under similar conditions.

Modifications
-------------
The code now checks if IndexOutOfBounds is raised and if so it returns
-2, which is also used for replica operations when the replica is not
even in the config. This allows for consistent handling and doesn't
involve changing much of the logic.

If the locator gets this -2 from the config, it sends the op into the
retry or cancel queue, since we can't dispatch the op right now,
waiting for a new config to arrive.

Result
------
Gracefully handle the situation where the server sends us a config but
it doesn't contain any partitions.

The partition id set here https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-jvm-core/blob/8ab8d1144fb89db5336dafd2f5f163d74f6836b8/src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/node/locate/KeyValueLocator.java#L121 should be incorrect if the partition size is zero and will the request retain that info on a retry?

Ok cool, one other thing if the ffmap is valid and the hash was using a partition size 0, the result may be incorrect, is that possible at all?

Oh this can't happen since we calculate the hash and the key lookup in the same codepath using a temporary local copy of the config. So it would either succeed or fail, and if it fails it would retry later with a potentially new config. So between line config.numberOfPartitions() and calculateNodeId() the config doesn't change.

Oh actually I think in theory it is possible that it changes but the the time window is so small and the edge cases very edgy that I think we don't need to guard for it.
