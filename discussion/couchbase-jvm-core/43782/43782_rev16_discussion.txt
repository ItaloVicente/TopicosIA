Line:286, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/AbstractGenericHandler.java -> see comment in DcpHandler, I'd prefer an alternative where we can't alter currentRequest

Line:181, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/dcp/DCPHandler.java -> do we really need this side effect? it makes things potentially more confusing to be able to mutate currentRequest... can't we just pass the dummy to the handle method?

Line:233, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/dcp/DCPHandler.java -> we'll have to think about a way of ensuring the content buffer is cleaned if no one consumes the stream...

Line:45, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/message/dcp/ConnectionType.java -> reverse the names?

Line:33, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/message/dcp/DCPRequest.java -> Is the interface supposed to have a method returning the ConnectionType?
(+ remove ", will")

Line:286, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/AbstractGenericHandler.java -> I will also put FIXME note

Line:181, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/dcp/DCPHandler.java -> There are two cases:

1) Queue is empty: 
In this case outer method picks 'null' as a current request, and it will might lead to NPEs because it does not cover scenario when we receive some packet without request in the queue.

2) Queue is not empty:
In this case we might notify about errors wrong observable in the outer method, so we have to substitute it as soon as we detected that incoming message is not relevant to 'current request'

I will leave explanation above in the code and mark it with FIXME

Line:233, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/dcp/DCPHandler.java -> I will leave a TODO item

Line:45, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/message/dcp/ConnectionType.java -> Done

Line:33, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/message/dcp/DCPRequest.java -> No, it is not. Fixed typo
