DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-480: Infrastructure for redacted logging (take 2)

Motivation
----------
The log redaction strategy has changed, removing the need
for advanced logic in the CouchbaseLogger implementations.

Instead of writing redacted log messages at the requested level and
duplicating them in unredacted form at DEBUG level, the new strategy
writes a single log statement at the requested level. If redaction is
enabled for a given argument, the arg is wrapped in "redaction tags"
that allow a log processing tool to tokenize the sensitive value.

Modifications
-------------
Make RedactableArgument.toString responsible for deciding
whether to wrap the value in "redaction tags". These tags
allow a log processing tool to tokenize the value.

Result
------
Redaction tags are disabled by default. They may be enabled or
disabled at any time by calling CouchbaseLoggerFactory.setRedactionLevel.
(There are no static initialization issues. A bug in the previous
implementation of log redaction made it impossible to enable redaction
because the logger factory was initialized with redaction disabled
before the user had a chance to call setRedactionLevel).

Following the new redaction strategy, messages are logged
only once, instead of being duplicated at DEBUG level in unredacted form.

Log redaction is no longer dependent on logic inside CouchbaseLogger.
A RedactableArgument may be passed directly to an SLF4J logger or to any
logger that formats message arguments by calling toString().
