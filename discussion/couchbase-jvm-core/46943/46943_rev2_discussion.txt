DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-151: fix broken query keepAlive

Motivation
----------
In QueryHandler, keepalive is broken: it is marked as finishedDecoding
too soon, not taking into account that the first response could not be
a LastHttpComponent. This can break the handling of query requests.

Modifications
-------------
Only finish the decoding and issue the response for keepalive when we
received a LastHttpComponent.

Results
-------
Keepalive doesn't interfere with query handling anymore.
