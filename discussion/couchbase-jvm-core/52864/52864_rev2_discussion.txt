see inline comments, also needs to be associated to a JVMCBC ticket in the first line of the commit message
Line:81, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregator.java -> this is more commonly done as a `flatMap` (use lambda notation for shorter code, just reuse the same anonymous class):

open(name, aggregatorState)
.flatMap(response -> response.stream())

Line:70, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregatorState.java -> IIRC this will fail with the int constructor above. new ArrayList(n) just prepares the backing array to be of the expected size to avoid dynamic resizing, it doesn't make list.size() return n for instance, which is required to call set()...

maybe add unit tests for this class?

Line:81, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregator.java -> done. Thanks.

We cannot use lambdas in the library code, or can we?
https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-jvm-core/blob/master/build.gradle#L55-L56

Line:70, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregatorState.java -> In fact I was relying on IndexOutOfBoundsException here. Maybe better to use BucketStreamState[]?

Line:81, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregator.java -> no indeed, we cannot use lambdas (it was just to make the comment shorter), looks good now ;)

Line:70, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/dcp/BucketStreamAggregatorState.java -> so if you construct a blank StreamAggregatorState using the numPartitions constructor, you don't want to be able to set new partition states? if so, you can rely on the Exception but should probably document it (and document that set won't work in the associated constructor)
