DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-47: Update RxJava to RC7.

Motivation
----------
1.0.0 GA shipped with RC3 and the plan is to make sure the code
stays as close as possible with bugfix releases until RxJava
hits 1.0.0 GA as well.

Modifications
-------------
Move to RC7.

Along the way, a assertion error was discovered where the abstract
loader did subscribe twice to the same scheduler.

Result
------
More bugfixes for users and us in RC7.
