DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-493: Negotiate JSON user agent in HELLO

Motivation
----------
As part of better tracing capabilities, the client must
negotiate an identifer in addition to the user agent.

Based on the RFC this format is a JSON hash with both
the agent and the identifier.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset uses the new CoreContext and its core ID
to negotiate the HELLO with a JSON blob. It also uses the
channel ID as a transient identifier as outlined in the RFC.

Simple unit tests in place which especially make sure that
the long values are hex padded as well as too long user
agent strings are cut off at 200 chars as per RFC.

Result
------
Properly negotiated JSON-based user agent in HELLO.

I have concerns about building JSON by hand, but otherwise looks good!
Line:153, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueFeatureHandler.java -> Is it conceivable that `agent` may contain quotation marks or backslashes, now or in the future? 

How do you feel about using Jackson to build the JSON so we can look at this method in isolation and know that it will always return valid JSON?

Line:168, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/endpoint/kv/KeyValueFeatureHandler.java -> Could simplify as:

    // Upper case hex, zero-padded to 16 digits
    return String.format("%016X", number);

I'm not normally a fan of String.format, but it's really good for this kind of thing, and this isn't on a performance-critical code path.
