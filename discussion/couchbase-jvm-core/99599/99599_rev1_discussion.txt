DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-566: Only continuously refresh for CarrierRefresher

Motivation
----------
Previously every refresh interval a signal would be sent from
the CarrierRefresher into the ConfigurationProvider to refresh
all refreshers.

Since only the CarrierRefresher actually did perform a refresh,
this turned out to be a noop on the HttpRerfresher. Now that
we are planning to add refreshing capabilities to the
HttpRefesher as well (but not all the time like with carrier)
the scope needs to change.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset is technically a "noop", because instead of doing
the indirection we now directly signal the refresh interval to
the CarrierRefresher. Nothing is changed here, but once the
HttpRefresher gets refresh capabilities, it is not pinged all
the time.

The reason why we do not want the HttpRefresher to be pinged
all the time is that it already has a streaming config attached
and only needs to run the refresh command if there is explicit
reason from other heuristics (i.e. a socket being closed).

Result
------
Continuous refreshing now only affects the CarrierRefresher
(as before) but the HttpRefresher is not affected in the future.

Looks good, other than the possible log spam.
Line:109, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/CarrierRefresher.java -> What is a typical poll interval?  E.g. is this spammy?

Line:109, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/refresher/CarrierRefresher.java -> This is only happening if we have a cluster object but no buckets yet, so should only be log at most 1-2 during startup and shutdown. interval is 2.5s by default .. but we can make this trace in a different commit?

Note that I just transferred the code over, it has always been like this
