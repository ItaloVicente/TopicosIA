DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-580: Support subdoc expansion of macro

Motivation
----------
Adding server-side expansion of xattrs macros such as "${Mutation.CAS}"
This is required for the multi-document atomicity project.

Modifications
-------------
Added expandMacros fields to all required builders, and pass down a new
0x10 flag to the server to indicate that macros should be expanded for
a particular field.

Result
------
Tested that ${Mutation.CAS} is replaced with the doc's CAS as expected.
