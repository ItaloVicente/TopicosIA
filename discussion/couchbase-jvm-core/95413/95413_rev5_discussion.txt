DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-542: Add support for multi network configurations.

Motivation
----------
This changeset adds support for multi network configuration,
which is especially needed in cloud environments where a
kubernetes setup or similar is required. The associated
SDK-RFC is #39.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset is made up of basically two changes:

 - first, the config parsing logic has been extended to understand
   the optionally available externalAddresses and if found in the
   config they are now exposed for usage.
 - the bootstrap workflow has been adapted to accomodate the different
   configurations for auto-pickup or external override.
 - finally, the NodeInfo has been modified to dynamically provide the
   external info so we only have to toggle in one place and not fix
   up all kinds of code paths which may access the node info.

Test cases have been added.

Result
------
core-io now supports multi network configurations as outlined in
the SDK RFC #39.

Line:524, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/DefaultConfigurationProvider.java -> DCP client will need to do the same thing. What do you think about making this `public static` in BucketConfigParser, and passing in the list of seed nodes?

Or I wonder if it would make sense to add the seed nodes to `ConfigParserEnvironment` and just have `BucketConfigParser.parse` handle everything?

Line:95, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/DefaultNodeInfo.java -> The Server PRD section "Client Behaviour Expectations -> External Clients" mentions that if the external:ports section is absent, the client should default to the same ports as for the internal config.

Is that case handled somewhere?

Line:524, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/DefaultConfigurationProvider.java -> one of the problems with that approach is that the seed nodes could rotate away over time if they are not part of the cluster at all anymore.. that's why I stuck it to "only do the check on first attempt". Any idea how we could carry that state into the static instance?

Line:524, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/DefaultConfigurationProvider.java -> I see. Maybe BucketConfigParser.parse is not the right place for this. It would still be good to be able to reuse this code somehow.

What if the call site were changed to:

    if (oldConfig == null) {
        externalNetwork = determineNetworkResolution(
                environment.networkResolution(), newConfig, seedHosts);
    }

Then the public static method `determineNetworkResolution` could do handle all of the resolution logic (the switch statement, etc). It would then be up to the caller to do the "first time only" check, and provide the seed host addresses.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:95, src/main/java/com/couchbase/client/core/config/DefaultNodeInfo.java -> I've fixed it up so that if the external should be used but ports are not present, it uses the others. (see next changeset)
