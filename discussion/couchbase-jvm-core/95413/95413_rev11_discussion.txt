DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-542: Add support for multi network configurations.

Motivation
----------
This changeset adds support for multi network configuration,
which is especially needed in cloud environments where a
kubernetes setup or similar is required. The associated
SDK-RFC is #39.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset is made up of basically two changes:

 - first, the config parsing logic has been extended to understand
   the optionally available externalAddresses and if found in the
   config they are now exposed for usage.
 - the bootstrap workflow has been adapted to accomodate the different
   configurations for auto-pickup or external override.
 - finally, the NodeInfo has been modified to dynamically provide the
   external info so we only have to toggle in one place and not fix
   up all kinds of code paths which may access the node info.

Test cases have been added.

Result
------
core-io now supports multi network configurations as outlined in
the SDK RFC #39.
