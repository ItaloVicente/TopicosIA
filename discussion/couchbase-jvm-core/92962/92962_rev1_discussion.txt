Patch Set 1:

SASL Authentication mechanism provides by Couchbase Java client is not safe. The value returned by Couchbase Server for SASL Step Response is not evaluated. Couchbase Java Client checks only the status of step response.

else if (msg.getOpcode() == SASL_STEP_OPCODE) {
  checkIsAuthed(msg);
}
See RFC 5802

The server verifies the nonce and the proof, verifies that the authorization identity (if supplied by the client in the first message) is authorized to act as the authentication identity, and, finally, it responds with a "server-final-message", concluding the authentication exchange.
The client then authenticates the server by computing the ServerSignature and comparing it to the value sent by the server. If the two are different, the client MUST consider the authentication exchange to be unsuccessful, and it might have to drop the connection.
