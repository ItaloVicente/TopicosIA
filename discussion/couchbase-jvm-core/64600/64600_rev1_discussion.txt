DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-338: Fix parsing of results only, no errors/metrics

Motivation:
-----------
The previous change was incomplete in the sense that a response with
only results followed by status would still fail and timeout.

Modifications:
--------------
The QueryHandler has been modified to work with a response where the
metrics section is omitted, and there's only results (no errors/warn).

This involves detecting end of a results section despite not having a
new { after said section => rely also on lastChunk.

Added a "success 1" test without metrics.
Modified 1 test so that it uses only one DefaultLastHttpContent instead
of several in a row (as that would trigger lastChunk detection).

Results:
--------
Response without metrics is now supported by the QueryHandler.
