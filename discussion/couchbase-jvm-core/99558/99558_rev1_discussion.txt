DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-565: Detect dead tcp sockets on http config stream

Motivation
----------
When using memcached buckets, we are establishing an http streaming
conection to ns_server which pushes config changes to the sdk. If
no topology changes are going on, the streaming connection is silent
but kept open.

When the tcp connection is in a dead/half-closed state (server closed
but client never received a tcp close) then we cannot distinguish
between "no activity" and "dead and silent".

Note that "proper" tcp socket closes have been detected properly before
and are not affected.

Modifications
-------------
To remedy this situation, this changeset adds a read idle timer to
the netty pipeline which is configurable on the environment and
defaults to 30 seconds. When the connection is idle for longer than
this period, the channel is closed and the upper layer (HttpRefresher)
will open a new connection.

This pretty much guarantees a configurable upper bound until when
this happens a new configuration is loaded and the system returns into
a stable state. The downside is that even in a healthy system, each
interval a socket is closed and reopened.

In the future we might be able to tune these heuristics further, but
for now this seems like a good compromise between network activity
and failure recovery.

Result
------
Streaming connections now return to a healthy state with a deterministic
upper bound even in this edge case described above.
