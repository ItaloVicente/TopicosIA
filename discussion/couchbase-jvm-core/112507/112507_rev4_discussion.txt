DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-574 NetworkAddress issues with ipv6

Motivation
=========
We need to test NetworkAddress creation with ipv6 strings.

Modification
============
Since the issue above cropped up from creating a NetworkAddress,
I added a simple test that verifies both ::1 and the specific
ipv6 address that _seemed_ problematic both do parse correctly
now.  Additionally, added specific ipv6 to the ConnectionStringTests
as we now use it.
