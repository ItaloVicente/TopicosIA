DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-555: Expose Analytics IO Pool config

Motivation
----------
For other services it was possible to configure a custom isolated
IO pool but analytics was using the one from query. This changeset
fixes this so that its also possible to configure a custom IO
pool just for analytics.
