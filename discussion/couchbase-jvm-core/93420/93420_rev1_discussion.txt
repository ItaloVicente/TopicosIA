DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-530: Adding Automatic-Module-Name for Java 9 modules

Motivation
----------
A user is trying to use our client as a Java 9 module.  Right now they
need to put in their module-info.java:

module com.mycompany {
    requires core.io;
}

this will change it to:

module com.mycompany {
    requires com.couchbase.java.core;
}

Note that this does not make us a 'proper' Java 9 module, e.g. one with
a module-info.java and compiled with JDK9.  We cannot do that right
now as we need to be JDK6.  But Java 9 has a feature called
'automatic modules', where a Java 9 app can add our jar to the
--module-path and it will pretend we're a proper module.  This change
ensures we have a better module name than the auto-guessed 'core.io'.

Modifications
-------------
Adding Automatic-Module-Name into the jar's manifest file.

Note this isn't really a breaking change even though we're changing the
module name, as currently you can't use our jar as an automatic module
anyway (see JCBC-1193).

Removing Jackson from MANIFEST-INF/service.  Haven't been able to find
where it's being added, but it's not deliberately from us AFAICT.  Perhaps
part of the shading.  Anyway, Java 9 refuses to use us an automatic module
as it sees the Jackson service but can't find the .class files, as they've
been shaded.

There's an unrelated removal of the Sonotype plugin, which causes Maven
to fail on my system.  I believe it's not needed - please verify.

No way to unit test, but I've tested manually against JDK6 and 9 apps.

Result
------
Works as currently from a JDK6 app.

In a JDK9 app, the new module name works.
