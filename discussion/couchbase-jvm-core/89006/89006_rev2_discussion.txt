DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-491: Propagate CoreContext into Services

Motivation
----------
This larger changeset doesn't do anything else other than changing
the signatures to not take both the environment and the ringbuffer
but rather the context directly.

Modifications
-------------
Due to the signature changes, tests and parent/child relationships
also all had to be modified.
