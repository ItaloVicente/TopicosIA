DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-1373 Fix integration tests

Motivation
==========
Getting Jenkins integration tests to pass, like they do when run
locally.

Modification
===========
This eliminates the many warnings about having multiple couchbase
envirnoments during the tests.  Well, almost all - a couple tests
do make more than one.  However, none leak outside the test itself
now.
