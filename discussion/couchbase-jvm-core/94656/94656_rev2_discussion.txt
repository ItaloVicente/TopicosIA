DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-538: Align tracer config with SDK-RFC.

Motivation
----------
The RFC outlines the naming and configuration options of the tracer
so the SDK must follow those naming guidelines and configuration
properties. One is adapted and one added in this changeset.

Modifications
-------------
This changeset brings a couple of changes:

 1) tracingEnabled is renamed to operationTracingEnabled to align
    with the RFC naming.
 2) operationTracingServerDurationEnabled has been added which
    is enabled by default and allows to disable the server tracing
    while still doing client side tracing.
 3) the config options are promoted to committed from experimental
    in time for the 1.6.0 release bump.
