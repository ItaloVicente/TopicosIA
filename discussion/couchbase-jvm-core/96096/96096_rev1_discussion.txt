How this change works with situations where we need handle not my vbucket error with attached config as a payload? If you won't add service, the library will never send request in a first place. Right?

So this case is only concerned about adding a new service, it would delay it until there is at least one vbucket. You'd still get the NVM if the request goes to the "old" node and then we'd take the config and analyze it. Both are different codepaths -- what could happen though is that requests with a NVM need to get retried since the service is not added.

That said that would happen anyways since as long as the server doesn't have the partitions assigned to it we can't route traffic there.. Thinking about it we might be able to check if its part of the fast forward map but then I don't know if we run into the same troubles?
