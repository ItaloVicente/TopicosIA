DESCRIPTION:

JVMCBC-560: Do not mark Node as disconnected if service is degraded

Motivation
----------
Before this change, if a Node has a service pool that is degraded
(and no other service in a non-idle state), then the Node would
mark itself in a DISCONNECTED state which also would cause a
NodeDisconnectedEvent to be sent into the event bus.

The node might end up in a situation like the following: the node
only has the config service and a query service enabled. The
config service is idle since it is not used, and if the query
pool goes from 1 to 2 endpoints it might temporarily go into
a degraded state until the endpoint is connected as well. Since
the service is now degraded and the other service is idle, without
any changes the node ends up in a DISCONNECTED state.

Modifications
-------------
The ServiceStateZipper did not take the degraded state into account,
which caused it to switch into the disconnected branch and this
is not correct.

This change makes the zipper recognize the degraded state from the
upstream components and it will put the Node into a degraded
state as well - this is largely an internal state and does not
emit a disconnected event.

Result
------
The SDK does not emit a NodeDisconnectedEvent if the node isn't
actually disconnected.
