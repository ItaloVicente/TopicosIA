DESCRIPTION:

Ability to customize the waiting strategy for requests/repsonses on ring buffer.

I have observed that the default strategy (BlockingWaitStrategy) is slowing down The Java client at high throughput rates.
Other alternatives are available which can be use to tune the Java client performance.

thanks for your contribution!

I've heavily experimented with those as well but I could not get a significant bump under many use cases - which workload pattern do you have and what strategy gives better perf for you?

I'll review the changeset in a separate comment :)

I haven't tested all of the strategies, actually only YieldingWaitStrategy was the strategy I've used.
I have tested it in an isolated environment embedding java client into HTTP REST service: 
Pros of YWS:
 - much better response times (x4 or even more) at high HTTP requests rate per second (3-5k rps)
Cons of YWS:
 - consumes 2 cores of CPU when in IDLE state (no incoming HTTP requests)
 - requires 4 cored machine per app instance

This looks good to me from a high standpoint. I opened a JIRA ticket to track this: https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JVMCBC-335

The commit message would need to be brought in line with the format we usually use (but we can do that just before merging).

Also this would need an associated change in java-client, as the CouchbaseEnvironment must have an overload of the new builder method.

I have signed the CLA.
I will change the commit message and check the java-client.
