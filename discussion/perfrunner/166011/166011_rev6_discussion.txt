DESCRIPTION:

Fix broken memory fragmentation test

The kv_fragmentation_5M_1s_1c test was not working:
http://perf.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/ares/24829/
With this patch included, the test seems to work:
http://perf.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/ares/25093/
I also re-enabled it in the weekly pipeline.
Finally, I also changed the install libcouchbase code
to include the case where libcouchbase was not previously
installed: http://perf.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/ares/25096/
