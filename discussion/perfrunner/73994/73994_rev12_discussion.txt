DESCRIPTION:

CBPS-323: Create RBAC users for KV, N1QL, and monitoring operations

For our performance tests we need users with the following
capabilities:
* CRUD KV operations
* CRUD N1QL operations
* Bucket monitoring (stats collection)

If we create internal (builtin) users that match corresponding
bucket names then we can keep the existing code for the above
mentioned operations.

Currently, the following tests are still using super-user
privileges:
* Tools (e.g., backup)
* DCP
* FTS

We need to modify those cases to start using "bucket-X:password"
credentials. We need to create corresponding RBAC users as well.

Please note, certain operations (e.g., index creation) will be
performed using super user credentials (aka Administrator:password).
