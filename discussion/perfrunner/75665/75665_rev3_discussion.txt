DESCRIPTION:

Switch to Python 3.5

Before switching to Python 3.x we need to address the following
compatibility issues:
* Relative imports are not supported.
* Package "Queue" was renamed to "queue"
* Functions "map", "filter", and "range" return iterators now.
* Function "xrange" no longer exists.
* Integer division yields floats.
* Package "ConfigParser" was renamed to "configparser".
* All exceptions were moved built-in module.
* Exceptions do not have "message" attribute anymore.
* "urlparse" and "urlopen" were moved to package "urllib".
* Unicode string should encoded befor hashing.
* C extensions should be rewritten.

What won't work:
* FTS utils still require Python 2.7. We can fix them later if
needed.
