DESCRIPTION:

Switch to Python 3.5

Before switching to Python 3.x we need to address the following
compatibility issues:
* Relative imports are not supported.
* Package "Queue" was renamed to "queue"
* Functions "map", "filter", and "range" return iterators now.
* Function "xrange" no longer exists.
* Integer division yields floats.
* Package "ConfigParser" was renamed to "configparser".
* All exceptions were moved built-in module.
* Exceptions do not have "message" attribute anymore.
* "urlparse" and "urlopen" were moved to package "urllib".
* Unicode string should encoded befor hashing.
* 'generator' objects have no attribute 'next'
* Named tuples don't have attribute "__dict__"
* C extensions should be rewritten.
* Python client for seriesly has to be updated as well.
* Ansible should be upgraded to version 2.2.x.
* python3-dev should be installed on the client machines.

What won't work:
* FTS utils still require Python 2.7. We can fix them later if
needed.
