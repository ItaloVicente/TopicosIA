DESCRIPTION:

1. Added new MOI performance tests
2. Added new methods require to run MOI tests. MOI tests run spring from all data nodes in the cluster for maximum throughput
3. Changed the way we calculate index complete, for both initial and incremental index builds.

Change-Id: I641f93efe99c2c405fc3cd8a2b8f3915405aa51f

Changed the parameters for the MOI spec file to reflect the correct hardware info and to confer with the standards. Renamed the file to reflect the use of the spec file.

Please also fix the issues reported by Jenkins.
Line:103, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects

It is good practice to use the with keyword when dealing with file objects. This has the advantage that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised on the way.

Line:233, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> We should not run spring from the command line.

All other tests use Python / Celery API. Why do we need a unique approach here?

Line:313, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Please use more programmatic approach (i.e., use "requests" package instead of curl).

Line:131, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> Why?

Line:103, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Working on this

Line:233, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> We tried running using Celery API's. But the KV throughput we wanted to achieve was not possible when using the existing APIs. This was the best way to achieve the high KV thoroughput required for MOI tests (>100K to 250K ops/sec).

Line:313, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Working on this

Line:131, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> Sleep was required so that we get the updated indexer settings. While printing the new settings is not absolutely required, it helps while analysing the runs to know the indexer settings being used.

Line:233, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Hm, I'm wondering why we see lower throughput...

Line:131, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> Fair enough.

Line:103, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Done

Line:233, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> I had tried to investigate this while developing the tests. But owing to shortage of time, we had parked this question for the time and went ahead with the current approach. The main objective at the time of test development was to achieve really high KV ops so that we could measure the performance of MOI and catch meaningful issues.
