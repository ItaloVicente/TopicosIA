DESCRIPTION:

MB-15165: Add spatial tests

Add spatial test to perfrunner. It loads the data and queries from files
and executes it on the cluster. There are test for initial/incremental index
build, latency with/without load and query throughput without load.

+2 as my comments are likely tailoring and not necessary, but have some future implications
Line:46, perfrunner/tests/view.py -> is it safe to just delay a period of time.  experience with 2i is that anything other than excessive time delays don't cover all conditions, e.g. key characteristics, e.g., put the indexing key near the end of large doc'ts, and the time to create an index multiplies - json parsing.  is there a state that can be checked for the completion of building the spatial index.
the only way i can guarantee with 2i, is to create a query run with observe, which requires the index.  if i don't do this last check, there is a race condition that perfruner will win starting workload and having the query go against the primary index instead.

Line:29, tests/spatial_index_rea03.test -> this seems to be a new definition of the [access] settings. you use 'ops' instead of 'throughput' - KV, 'query_throughput' - View Query, 'n1ql_throughput'.  perhaps minor, would not 'spatial_throughput' make it easier to understand (and suggest you can layer more than one concurrent stream.  of course that would require the 'spatial' doc_gen to create the 'new_doc' document with extensions for spatial.  
we have multiple tests that compbine n1ql query workload over background KV Get/Set Workload (avoid layering query workload because of issues with cbmonitor needing separate collectors for all attributes at each layer) but concurrent KV and some higher level, is a mandatory test point

Line:12, tests/spatial_lat_load_rea03.test -> only numa, a singleton node, has initial = 1, is this correct

See my inline responses.
Line:46, perfrunner/tests/view.py -> I've just copy and pasted whatever the current view tests are doing.

Line:29, tests/spatial_index_rea03.test -> No, `ops` is the original way of doing things (see the mapreduce tests).

`*_throughput` is the number of operations per second.

`spatial_throughput` is used in the saptial tests that do queries. Though the new way of doing things is putting it as `throughput` into the `[spatial]` section instead of cluttering `[access]` with `spatial_throughput`.

There's also a test with background kv load (spatial_lat_load_rea03.test), this test is *only* about initial and incremental index build.

Line:12, tests/spatial_lat_load_rea03.test -> No idea I just copied it from the view tests,
