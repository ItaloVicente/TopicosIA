DESCRIPTION:

Simplify test settings

Instead of defining some attributes multiple times, defined them
only once in their designated section. For example `size` and `doc_gen`
is now defined *only* in the `[load]` section, but re-used in the `[hotload]`
and `[access]` section.

Can I please have more +2/+1. I'll like to make sure everyone is aware of that change, so in case it breaks anything, you know where to look :)

Line:143, perfrunner/tests/__init__.py -> Careful - if I read this correctly we cannot have a different size in the hot_load section from load.

Can I suggest you only make this trigger if there wasn't already a size specified?

Similarly for the other phases.

DaveR's suggestion of an override feature is probably worthwhile.

Line:143, perfrunner/tests/__init__.py -> That's the whole point of the change. There wasn't any test that used different sizes.

Line:143, perfrunner/tests/__init__.py -> Sure, but previously one had the ability to make that be the case. You're removing this capability; if a future test wanted to specify a different size it wouldn't be possible (assuming I'm understanding the config parsing code).

Yes that's correct. Keeping the API (in this case the settings) to a minimal. Just think of it as "you can't set a size in other areas other than [load].

Line:143, perfrunner/tests/__init__.py -> My last comment should've been inline here. It was intentional to keep the setting number as low as possible. You can set everything everywhere, but only certain things on certain sections.

Though I'm open to change it. Preferably from somone who needs to maintain the whole thing :)

I've talked with Dave about it and we agreed that it should put out an error of the size setting is set in another section, instead of overriding it silently.

I'll upload a new change.

after DaveR's comment, agree that we lose current desired behavior if we eliminate the ability to set different configurations in load and hot load and access.  note document size is a fixed size (all the named attributes other than body) plus a variable body.  so allowing different size doc'ts was only in the experimental category of tests, to mimic a customer. 
prefer that we fix the problem of when the doct size correctly from load (i.e., it is mandatory in load, optional in hot_load and access). we would satisfy both demands

Thomas, would you approve a change that makes it impossible to set the sizes in other changes. That's what I propose in my latest comment.

I don't see a reason why you would want to have different sizes and we don't have a single test currently that needs it. I really want to keep the API (the possible settings) as minimal as possible.
