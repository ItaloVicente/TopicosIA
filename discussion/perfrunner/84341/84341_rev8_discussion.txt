DESCRIPTION:

Randomly distribute operations on the working set

Currently, both hot and cold keys correspond to the sorted
subsets of the entire keyspace.

The keyspace is still logically divided based on the
alphabetical order. However, before emitting a new key the
generator shifts it using a common prime number. The access
pattern hence becomes random.

One of the biggest challenges of this implementation is ability
to support inserts and deletions in addition to random read
requests. The only way to satisfy all these requirements is to
keep the size of the cold and hot spaces fixed. Also only cold
items can be deleted and new keys shift the fixed keyspace.

In a presence of insert operations, the leftmost part of the
initial key space (before "primization") represents a shadow
space space that cannot be read. Shadow (or frozen) keys can be
removed, though.

FIXME: KeyForRemoval, unit tests for MovingWorkingSetKey.
