Line:1394, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> I don't know if I am missing something in this line, but doesn't it just get the last value in stats and if it is None it becomes 0? If that's the case isn't it needlessly complicated? 

Couldn't you just write this as
if stats := stats[-1]:
    There is a value go do something with it
else:
   stats has no value in it, break your while loop since you are done

Line:1394, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> So originally I was trying to avoid errors since asking an array for -1 index will throw an exception if the array is empty. But that is indeed needlessly complicated. I went with a try-catch approach, better readability and also prevent a full test from failing just because there were not stats in one fetch.
