DESCRIPTION:

Fix bug that prevents nodes being renamed in non-GCP cloud tests

When adding GCP infrastructure support, made a change to allow GCP instances to be renamed to their internal IPs instead of their external IPs. I inadvertently made it so that if any other cloud was being used, the instances wouldn't be renamed at all. This patch resolves that.
