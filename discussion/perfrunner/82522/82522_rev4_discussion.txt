DESCRIPTION:

Preserve remote Celery artifacts

Remote Celery files are always deleted at the end of the tests.
That becomes a problem when remote tasks fail and we need to
debug them.

It makes more sense to clean everything up before test execution
and keep worker's folders around after completion.
