Line:269, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> Please take a look at https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257

Line:315, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> I still have trouble understanding why you are trying to do here.

Line:323, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> See my previous comment. Why two seconds?

Line:205, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> See my previous comments. This change has a little to do with SOE workloads.

It would be nice if you could create a separate patch / commit.

Line:80, perfrunner/helpers/reporter.py -> Why do you need to remove this line?

Line:122, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> Did you mean:

   logger.info('Start task on {}'.format(instance))

I am not sure if "target" object has meaningful view when printed.

Line:54, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> I think worker_home is a constant location (/tmp/perfrunner). Do you really need to log that information?

Line:271, perfrunner/remote/linux.py -> Why not just "restore"?

I think we should always create backups w/o index definitions and get rid of "--disable-ft-indexes" and "--disable-gsi-indexes" flags.

Line:687, perfrunner/settings.py -> I think RestoreSettings is more appropriate.

Line:62, perfrunner/tests/ycsb.py -> See my previous comment.

All official tests are executed on clean setups. No need to delete indexes.

Line:33, perfrunner/workloads/ycsb.py -> I am still pretty sure that SOE workloads are not unique enough. You just need to add two or three options to PhaseSettings.

Line:37, perfrunner/workloads/ycsb.py -> Instead of creating a new set of parameters you can add new attributes to PhaseSettings.

Line:55, perfrunner/workloads/ycsb.py -> I think "kv" is "true" by default. No need to add a redundant and hard-coded option here.

Line:44, playbooks/init.yml -> Only SOE tests will required "/backups" directory.

init.yml contains mandatory initialization steps for all servers/clusters.

Line:3, tests/soe/ycsb_workloadsa_1nodecluster.test -> Please see my previous comment. We really need runs with 4 nodes.

Line:5, tests/soe/ycsb_workloadsa_1nodecluster.test -> See my previous comment. We need a new category for SOE workloads.

Line:20, tests/soe/ycsb_workloadsa_1nodecluster.test -> I just talked to Alex and it seems like we won't need to run workloads SA, SB, SC, and SD on a weekly basic.

Let's focus on advanced custom workloads.

Line:32, tests/soe/ycsb_workloadsa_1nodecluster.test -> Why ops = 10000?

Line:269, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> Done

Line:315, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> I saw some issue with restarting memcached when running locally (some times memcached is not restarted as expected), the memcached_restart.log file here if for troubleshooting purpose in case i see it again.

Line:323, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> I saw some issue with restarting memcached when running locally (some times memcached is not restarted as expected), 2 seconds are added here to make sure memcached is stable before it is used later.

Line:205, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> The code in ycsb soe test case do have a call to this function and it will fail if there is more than one index.

Line:80, perfrunner/helpers/reporter.py -> Not needed any more, just a change introduced by old changes that was just removed.

Line:122, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> Done

Line:54, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> Done

Line:271, perfrunner/remote/linux.py -> I think there are other class providing restore method, I think adding _withoutindex will be more explicit about what it does..

Line:687, perfrunner/settings.py -> Done

Line:62, perfrunner/tests/ycsb.py -> Done

Line:44, playbooks/init.yml -> Done

Line:3, tests/soe/ycsb_workloadsa_1nodecluster.test -> will add more tests with 4 nodes and 10M data set, after initial test goes through

Line:5, tests/soe/ycsb_workloadsa_1nodecluster.test -> do i need to modify showfast?

Line:20, tests/soe/ycsb_workloadsa_1nodecluster.test -> Done

Line:32, tests/soe/ycsb_workloadsa_1nodecluster.test -> new test settings will be added when running remote tests.
