DESCRIPTION:

Do not overwrite sampling interval in FTS collector

Currently, FTS stats are collected way too frequently (e.g., every
100ms) in some tests because the same interval is used for regular
stats and latency measurements.

I don't think that is intentional. We should use two different
intervals for cbft stats and latency samples.
