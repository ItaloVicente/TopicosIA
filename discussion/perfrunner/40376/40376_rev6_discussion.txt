DESCRIPTION:

PathoGen: Pathologically bad malloc workload.

Rationale: Create a set of documents and then update their sizes to
each different size class of the underlying allocator. Do this across
different threads (different CouchbaseClient objects), to emulate
diferent clients accessing them, and to cause malloc/free in memcached
across different threads.

Implementation: Spawn a number of worker threads, arranged in a ring,
with a queue linking each pair of Workers:

            Worker A --> queue 2 --> Worker B
               ^                        |
               |                        V
     Load -> queue 1                  queue 3
               ^                        |
               |                        V
            Worker D <-- queue 4 <-- Worker C
          (Supervisor)

Queue 1 is initially populated with 10,000 generator functions, each
of which returns a sequence of ascending document sizes [8, 16,
32...262144]. Each has it's own input queue (which is also the output
queue of the previous Worker). A worker pops a generator off it's
input queue, performs a Couchbase.set() of the next size, and then
pushes the generator onto it's output queue, for the next worker to
them operate on. This continues, passing documents around the ring
until all documents have reached their maximum size (256KB).

At this point the generator sleeps for a short period (to allow disk
queue to drain and memory to stabilize), then the whole process is
repeated (setting all documents back to 8 bytes) for the given number
of iterations.

Behaviour: This gives a multiple different clients working on the same
keys, which means that memory for the documents in memcached should be
malloc'd and free'd by different memcached threads (to stress the
allocator). Additionally, the workload should be deterministic.

Note (1) To try and keep mem_used approximately constant, a Supervisor
specialization watches for the last document reaching it's maximum
size, and then starts the next iteration - this ensures that all
documents are at their maximum size at the same point in time; before
we reset back to the smallest size again.

Note (2), that num of workers should be co-prime with #documents, to
ensure that each worker sets a given document to different sizes.
