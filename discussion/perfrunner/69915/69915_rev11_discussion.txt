DESCRIPTION:

CBPS-222: Explicitly define components, categories, and sub-categories

Corresponding change in ShowFast:

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/showfast/commit/0231e7e0f9b30cb573110252ee76be5a1b4ee5c2

Please note, these new attributes are not used in ShowFast, yet.
We are still in the middle of transition.

Here is the current plan:
* Make sure that all metrics in ShowFast database have "component",
"category", and "subCategory" fields.
* Get rif of ugly conditions in ShowFast.
* Replace ids in the test configuration files with human-friendly
titles.

Please note, some test cases produce multiple metrics that belong
to different categories (e.g., incremental & initial indexing,
import & export, and etc). Those cases will be migrated in a
separate patch.
