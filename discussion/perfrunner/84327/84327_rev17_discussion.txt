DESCRIPTION:

Support custom key formatters

Although we made a few attempts to use different key formatters in
the past, those attempts were not generic and flexible enough.

One way to solve this problem is by separating the key objects and
their string representation.

For backward compatibility we are going use "decimal" key formatter
by default. Hash formatter still can be enabled but using different
settings.

This patch also eliminates the need to extract the sequential key
number from the string representation.

Please, key class can be further extended to carry additional
metadata.
