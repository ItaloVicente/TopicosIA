File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Looks good, nice work :) You can consider most of my comments as optional suggestions so don't be alarmed by the quantity lol
Line:1880, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> Indeed 👍

Line:2092, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> nitpick: don't need enumerate since you aren't using the index variable i

Line:2093, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> After writing the previous comment I realised you could write this all a bit more succinctly using a list comprehension:

```
cluster_ids_not_uploaded = [cid for cid in self.cluster_ids]
```

Line:2107, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> this looks good so feel free to leave it as it is (especially if its already tested), but I can see one or two ways to make it potentially nicer

One thing is that currently the _check_if_given_cluster_are_uploaded method returns a list of cluster IDs for which logs _have_ been uploaded, but you could modify the method to return the list of cluster IDs for which logs _have not_ been uploaded yet, and that way you could do 
```
cluster_ids_not_uploaded = self._check_if_given_clusters_are_uploaded(cluster_ids_not_uploaded)
```
and avoid the subsequent for loop which removes things from `cluster_ids_not_uploaded`.

The other thing I was thinking was that technically if you want to avoid the 60 sleep which currently always happens, then you can write things this way (I'm including my previous suggestion to make it shorter):
```
while (time.time() - t0) < timeout_mins * 60:
    cluster_ids_not_uploaded = self._check_if_given_clusters_are_uploaded(cluster_ids_not_uploaded)
    if cluster_ids_not_uploaded == []:
        logger.info('All cluster logs have been successfully uploaded')
        return
     time.sleep(60)
     
logger.interrupt('Waiting for logs to upload has timed out after {} mins'.format(timeout_mins))
```

Line:36, perfrunner/utils/debug.py -> "name of the s3 bucket to download Capella cluster logs from" might be slightly better

Line:80, perfrunner/utils/debug.py -> Nothing wrong here, just wanted to highlight that in python you can also just call the split method on strings:

url_split = log_url.split('/')

Line:82, perfrunner/utils/debug.py -> Minor thing, but this can be a -1 index to get the last element

Line:91, perfrunner/utils/debug.py -> Again, no bug here but it is arguably a bit cleaner to handle retry loops like this using a while loop.

Instead of having the range-based for and then an if statement that checks whether retry variable has a specific value, you can do a while loop like so:

```
retries = 3
while retries > 0:
    <do stuff and return if success>
    retries -= 1
<now code after the loop only runs if we've ran out of retries>
```

if we want to change the number of retries or something, we can just change the retries variable.

Line:99, perfrunner/utils/debug.py -> Maybe something like `get_capella_cluster_logs` would be slightly more appropriate

Line:135, perfrunner/utils/debug.py -> We will want this log collection for all Capella tests I think, not just Azure

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:91, perfrunner/utils/debug.py -> You are right. That is a nicer way of doing it. I am always a bit vary in using while loops as it is easy to accidentally write an endless loop. So I default to for loop whenever I can.

The reason I've added retries is to prolong the time spent trying to get the logs. The object exists command retries 20 times with 5s intervals and there is no way to prolong it other than doing it again.
