DESCRIPTION:

Decrease number of workers in latency tests

Currently, throughput throttling is based on this algorithm:
* Workers perform a batch of queries (e.g., 100 queries).
* Workers sleep after every batch to guarantee the target throughput.

This is how sleep time is calculated:

    sleep_time = batch_size * num_workers / throughput

For 720 workers and 450 queries per second the sleep time is 160
seconds. Basically, each worker sends 100 queries and then sleeps
for 160 seconds. As a result we simulate very sporadic query throughput.
