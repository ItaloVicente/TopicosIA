DESCRIPTION:

Start stats collectors under a stateless context manager

This patch makes interaction between perf tests and stats
collectors more linear. Stats collector no longer maintain any
state. cbmonitor related information is now stored exclusively
in perf tests.

Context manager also makes sure that stats collectors are
terminated even if the test phase fails.

After this patch only metrics and tests have bi-directional
references.
