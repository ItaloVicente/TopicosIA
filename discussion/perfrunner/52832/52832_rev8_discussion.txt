DESCRIPTION:

Don't populate sections that are not defined

If a section is not defined in the test configuration it won't be accessible from
within the Python code. If a section should be populated with the default values
it needs to be explicitly added in the configuration file. An example would be
the `[bucket]` section which is part of all test files, but often without any
properties set. It will then use the hard-coded defaults.

Currently every test file has these mandatory sections:

 - [bucket]
 - [cluster]
 - [stats]
 - [test_case]
 - [worker_settings]

If one of them isn't defined the test will interrupt with an error.

i do not see the value in adding a required section (stats & workload) to every current test and failing the run when not found.  all tests currnently under development now fail.  
all sections should be optional, and all values for tests configuration have valid default values that are recorded at run time.  adding new sections as optional simplifies this change to just a couple of new tests.

The point of this change is the principal of "explicit is better than implicit".

If a new section is added, it should be coded to be optional and not setup something for *every* test. If it's optional, you don't need to change any test file. If it is a setting that should touch every test, you need to add it to every test. I think this will prevent accidental breakage a lot.

This is just a first step. It would e.g. also be possible to have master tests and you can include/inherit from them. But I think starting small makes sense, hence this change.

My code comments are none essential. However, as to the whole purpose of specifying mandatory sections, you will have to try to get more people's approval (let's say Wayne and Venu; let them know you are doing this and most things probably won't break). My hunch is that, as long as no or only few tests break, then people probably don't care. It looks like you went through a lot of test specs to ensure nothing breaks, so I won't stand in your way. I can see that you have a very organized approach and motivation behind this. So good luck!
Line:16, perfrunner/settings.py -> Can you please explain why @safe is needed? If a test tries to access a section, shouldn't it either exist or exception out?

Line:23, perfrunner/settings.py -> Interestingly, *as far as I know*, you don't have to declare a function @decorator . You can just go ahead and start using @mandatory without putting @decoratior before the def mandatory line.

Line:154, perfrunner/tests/__init__.py -> Is this going to make access phase do nothing silently even though a test tries to call it?

David, thanks for the review. I think you really got the point and why perfrunner needs to be improved in order to have a maintainable system in the future.
Line:16, perfrunner/settings.py -> Good question, I think I just kept it without much thinking (and also without changing too much). Perhaps that could be cleaned up, once this patch is accepted?

Line:23, perfrunner/settings.py -> Don't really know to be honest. I just ended up copy&pasting the `safe` decorator and it worked.

Line:154, perfrunner/tests/__init__.py -> IIRC perfrunner just calls those phases no matter what. Which is obviously a bad idea. Just imagine how many things are run that aren't intended to run. With this patch it at least prevents to start something that wasn't configured.
