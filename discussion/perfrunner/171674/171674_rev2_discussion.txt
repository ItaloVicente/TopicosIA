DESCRIPTION:

CBPS-1015: cancel compaction tasks before manually triggering compaction

For CBPS-1000 we changed compaction tests to achieve consistent total document size at the start of the timed compaction phase. Compaction tests did the following:
- Enable auto-compaction
- Load documents
- Wait for fragmentation % to drop to 60%
- Disable auto-compaction
- Manually trigger compaction (this is the timed compaction phase)

This worked as far as ensuring a more consistent total document size, however our 4 vBucket test was taking almost 5x longer. There were compaction tasks triggered during the load phase that took more than 8 hours to complete, and only after that was the manually triggered compaction task beginning.

This patch adds a step after disabling auto-compaction, where we also cancel all existing compaction tasks, to address this issue.
