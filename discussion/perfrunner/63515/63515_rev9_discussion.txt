Is this ready for review? I stopped in the middle of the review as perfrunner/helpers/remote.py removes a lot of unrelated things.
Line:2, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> This imports is not used. A run of flake8 should report it.

Line:6, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> Those imports are not used. A run of flake8 should report those.

Line:7, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> This imports is not used. A run of flake8 should report it.

Line:280, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> This change looks unrelated to FTS, it should be a separate commit.

Line:625, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> Please try to avoid non-related whitespace changes.
