DESCRIPTION:

Add N1QL YCSB latency tests

There was no working test or results on showfast for N1QL YCSB workloade
latency, so I took the equivalent test from the SDK tab, added versions
for 1 node and plasma. I also run the test on showfast for multiple
versions of couchbase server. Finally, I think it is a good idea to run
latency tests weekly, so I added them to the weekly pipeline.
