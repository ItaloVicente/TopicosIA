Line:241, cbagent/collectors/metrics_rest_api.py -> Is it better to do separate if statements as you have done or use elif statements after this one here? We will only end up in one branch anyways as it would exit the function with a return. I usually only use separate ifs when I multiple branches need to be executed one after another.

Line:303, cbagent/collectors/metrics_rest_api.py -> Why do you have target and stat_group in ()?

Line:176, perfrunner/helpers/cbmonitor.py -> Why do you have the - {''} here?

Line:251, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> Same questions here as my previous one. Why is the - {''} necessary?

Line:241, cbagent/collectors/metrics_rest_api.py -> good question, I've never actually thought about that.

I think elif is probably a bit more readable.

I've rewritten it now a bit differently, but I don't know if its better

Line:303, cbagent/collectors/metrics_rest_api.py -> This is Python's variable unpacking at work. The thing I'm iterating over is a zip of a list and a dictionary's items. In this case, `data` is an element of `samples`, `target` is a key from `self.minimal_targets` and `stat_group` is a value from `self.minimal_targets`.

Line:176, perfrunner/helpers/cbmonitor.py -> This question led me down a little rabbit hole of refactoring

Originally, for collections without a stat group defined I saved an "empty" stat group which was just ''. The idea was that if there are some collections with stat groups defined and some without, that is like having two stat groups (just one doesn't have a name). If no collections have any stat groups, then the stat groups set would just be {''}, and so to detect whether we have any named stat groups we would have to check if the stat group set is equal to {''}. Now that I type that, I realise I could have just done stat_groups == {''} but I apparently did the very silly bool(stat_groups - {''}).

I've refactored things now so that I don't have an "empty stat group". If some collections don't have stat groups while others do, then the ones without stat groups get ignored as far as reporting stats goes.
