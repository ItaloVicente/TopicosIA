(10 comments)

See inline comments.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> This sould be "CBD-1686", else it won't link with the Jira issue automatically.

Line:9, perfrunner/helpers/cbmonitor.py -> Why was `SpringSpatialQueryLatency` removed?

Line:10, perfrunner/helpers/cbmonitor.py -> Is the `SpringSubdocLatency` import missing?

Line:249, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> The only difference to `calc_kv_latency` is the database name. This sounds like it would make sense to refactor the code to re-use it for both functions.

Line:494, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> The only difference to `calc_network_througput` is slightly different labels and less information. I think a refactoring to use the same method for both would make sense.

Line:487, perfrunner/settings.py -> Given it's in its own section now, I don't think that's needed anymore.

Line:12, perfrunner/tests/subdoc.py -> This looks like a lot of imports that are not needed.

I think a `make test` will help you removing not needed ones.

Line:60, perfrunner/tests/subdoc.py -> You might want to either remove the commented out code or write a comment explaining why it is there.

Line:33, tests/subdoc_10M_1KB.test -> As it has it's own section now, the properties can be renamed to simply `workers` and `fields` :)

Line:31, tests/subdoc_20M_2KB_dgm.test -> This test file needs to be updated to use the new `[subdoc]` section.

I've kind of mentioned it, but I should say it more clearly again. Please run `make test` and you might find things that need fixing (like missing/too many imports) and style things.
