File Comment: clusters/subdoc.spec -> Are these IPs your VMs or what will go into production?

I would prefer if we would move forward to add new sections (as the spatial stuff does (and n1ql kind of does)).

This would mean that instead of keep extending the `access` section, having a `subdoc` section with a property called `workers` and `fields`.

Volker, since subdoc test is in the same paradigm as KV, for some reason I like the symmetry of using the same names "access" for both regular KV and subdoc tests ... unless there's something in subdoc that will break the paradigm. Anyhow, not a big issue with me either way.
File Comment: clusters/subdoc.spec -> Agreeing Eric, hope this is production stuff.
Line:23, clusters/subdoc.spec -> ?

Line:2, tests/subdoc_10M_1KB.test -> At some point you will need a title here for showfast posting.

David, the reason for my comment is, that in "spring" it has its own worker. And I think  every worker should have it's own configuration section.

Sandip came and it seems you would like the two lines to be in its own section, something like:

[subdoc]
subdoc_workers = 30
subdoc_fields = city,email,name

In this case, I think there's a point in making access phase clean instead of lumping more and more knobs in one section.
