Things are getting better and better. Keep going, we are getting close :)
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please change it to `CBD-1686: ...` so that it automatically links to the issue.

Line:10, perfrunner/helpers/cbmonitor.py -> `SpringSpatialQueryLatency` shouldn't be removed.

Line:482, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> This function looks almost the same as `calc_network_throughput()`. Could it be combined into one function (or at least parts of it), instead of duplicating it?

Line:241, perfrunner/settings.py -> You could change this to:

    subdoc = self._get_options_as_dict('subdoc')
    access.subdoc = SubDocSettings(options)

And even push the `if options` into the `SubDocSettings` class (similar to what `SpatialSettings` does.

For more information please see the comment below on the `SubDocSettings` class.

Line:524, perfrunner/settings.py -> I think that's a left-ofer from previous versions and should be removed.

Line:721, perfrunner/settings.py -> You need to prefix all the variables with `subdoc_` in order to prevent name clashes. It would be way easier if you would add a single property called `subdoc` which again has sub-properties with the values you've specified in the subdoc section.

Take the `SpatialSettings` class as an example. It doesn't have any other dependency on other sections, but is standalone (as opposed to `SubDocSettings` which has a dependency on the `access` section). This way it could (potentially) easily not only been used during the access phase, but also added to other phases. Only a single property in those phases would need to be added.

So I would just make this a standalone class that is then added as a property as mentioned in the comment above. Just replace `access.` with `self.`.
