Line:101, perfrunner/helpers/cbmonitor.py -> Why can't these just be run locally? I think it would be still quite useful to get net, iostat even if you're running on the local machine.

I agree that it would be useful. But the problem is that in the current code SSH access is needed in order to collect those stats. It expects it can ssh to every box.

My current goal isn't to get real numbers out, but rather have it work locally.

It should be simple enough to push the test for local down to the actual checker and do something like:

if host=='localhost':
    subprocess.call(cmd)
else:
   # existing code - ssh.run(cmd) or whatever.

I'm having a look. There was other remote stuff that I clearly wouldn't want to have run on my system (with sudo access). But running iostat etc seems to be possible.

Perhaps there's a better solution. No further review is needed atm.
