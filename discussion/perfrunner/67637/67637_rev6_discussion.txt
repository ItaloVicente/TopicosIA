DESCRIPTION:

CBPS-170: Add standalone fio benchmarks

Unfortunately, the existing SSD drives change performance
characteristics over time. We need to track performance of disks
and file systems on a daily/weekly basis.

fio[1] looks like a good tool for I/O benchmarking.

The current test runs a mixed workload on every remote server and
prints out the aggregated IOPS stats per host. Here is an example
of the execution log:

[13/Sep/2016 11:13:07] INFO - Running fio job: tests/fio/mixed.ini
[13/Sep/2016 11:19:58] INFO - IOPS: {
    "172.23.99.87": 16049
}

The next step would be to post periodic results for all performance
servers to a dashboard similar to fdb.sc.couchbase.com.
