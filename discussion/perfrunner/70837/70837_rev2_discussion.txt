Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's a good practice to separate the commit subject from the commit message body.

Line:190, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> What exactly does this comment mean?

Line:312, perfrunner/tests/tools.py -> Do you really need to export data every time?

If data doesn't change, it makes more sense to create files once and then re-use them.

The same most likely applies to convert_json_in_csv and CSV import above.

Line:316, perfrunner/tests/tools.py -> You should try to split this case.

Currently, many import/export tests take 4+6 hours. That becomes a problem if we need to reproduce just one specific scenario.

Line:190, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> it means this functionality is broken now for huge samples( CE import) due to MB-21945 & 
MB-21946. Also for 4.6 & 4.7 we have different commands. now I added command for spock because it's not clear if MB-21946 will be fixes in 4.6. when the situation becomes clearer, we may need to add the implementation depending on the version

Line:312, perfrunner/tests/tools.py -> data have a different format here: for cbtransfer we need headers(id,flags,expiration,cas,value,rev,vbid,dtype), for cbimport we need only list of jsons

Line:316, perfrunner/tests/tools.py -> Pavel, I understand that it takes >4 hours but we  save time on data uploading for each test => less tests/runs/code. a very small chance that it will be necessary to run the tests separately. in any case, we will gain time. You do not agre?

Line:190, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> 4.6 is pretty much locked, we should focus on Spock.

Line:312, perfrunner/tests/tools.py -> I don't quite understand why cbimport is relevant here.

These are your current steps:

Line 311: You flush the bucket.
Line 312: You export data to CSV using cbtransfer. What exactly do you export if the bucket is empty after the previous step?
Line 315: You import CSV using cbtransfer. I have two concerns:

1) I assume you are going to install an EE build, run cbtransfer, and eventually report the "CE" results. If that's the case, then you should use CE builds for CE KPI.

2) My point is that it should be possible to store a sample CSV file somewhere on the client machine. Then you can create a separate test with just one step - import CSV data (similar to samples).

In short, this complicated sequence of steps (load -> export -> flush -> import -> covert -> flush -> import -> flush -> ...) does look redundant.

Line:316, perfrunner/tests/tools.py -> See my comment above. I believe it is possible to split tests without impact on *total* execution time.
