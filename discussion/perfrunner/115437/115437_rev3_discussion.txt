DESCRIPTION:

CBPS-681 KV SSL Tests

This adds SSL tests for all KV throughput and latency tests. Introduces
the ability to specify a cipher suite which will be set in the
cluster util script.

Cipher suites can be specified in the spec file like:

cipher_list = FIRST_CIPHER,SECOND_CIPHER

The minimum TLS version can be set with:

min_tls_version = tls_1.2

To pin a particular version of TLS, make sure to use a cipher for that
version, to force memcached to use that protocol.

This defines specs for default TLS tests (just turns
TLS on and let ciphers default) only. This is because there are
currently some bugs/consistency issues with setting ciphers. When
these are addressed, cipher specific tests can be added.

In future, we should upgrade pillowfight and use its TLS configuration
options, to give greater flexibility and better preditctibility.

This is most of the legwork for SSL tests. There are currently some issues with latency tests that I've not been able to solve (though I have an idea where the issue lies), I've left these out of the pipeline. Unfortunately I've run out of time to debug this further. Will update the CBPS with more info so it can be looked into later on.
