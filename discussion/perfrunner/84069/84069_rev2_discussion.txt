DESCRIPTION:

Allow to control the number of online CPU cores

perfrunner allows to throttle CPU resources temporary. However, the
existing implementation lacks both flexibility and correctness.

First of all, perfrunner makes a few very unreliable assumptions:
* It assumes that 2 sockets are present
* It assumes that all even CPUs belong to one socket, and all odd
ones belong to another (for instance, Leto nodes have different
topology)
* It assumes that hyper-threading is enabled
* It doesn't allow to control the number of online CPU and always
keeps supposedly 3/4 of the available resources

New option "online_cores" allows to specify explicitly how many
*physical* cores should be online. The remaining cores will be
put offline temporary.

This new implementation takes hyper-threading into consideration
but doesn't manage HT settings. It's recommended to disable or
enable HT in BIOS.

Please note, we do not attempt to distribute offline cores evenly
across multiple sockets. For instance, if there are 2 sockets with
12 physical cores per socket and "online_cores" is set to 6, then
only 6 cores on the first socket will be online.
