"Use the imperative mood in the subject line"

"Use the body to explain what and why"

Line:558, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> I don't think that sum is the right aggregate here.

Let's say we got 5 YCSB log files and each file reports 1ms latency (p95). If I understand correctly, the output of your function is going to be 5ms. That doesn't make a lot of sense.

Line:561, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> It seems like a lot of duplication to create two nearly identical functions for latency parsing. Maybe there is a way to refactor your patch so that we have only one method.

Line:798, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> We won't need this in daily. Only weekly metrics should be extended.

Line:72, perfrunner/tests/ycsb.py -> Throughput tests are meant to max out the system, hence latency measurements are not appropriate.

It probably makes more sense to create a separate class for latency tests.

Line:77, perfrunner/tests/ycsb.py -> How do you plan to use these reporters when a workload doesn't use INSERT or SCAN operations?
