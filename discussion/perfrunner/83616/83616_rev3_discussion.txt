Line:186, perfrunner/helpers/cluster.py -> Isn't this always true?

Line:194, perfrunner/helpers/cluster.py -> "0, " is redundant.

Line:198, perfrunner/helpers/cluster.py -> Is it really required? Couchbase process should already have access to the "data" directory.

Line:171, perfrunner/settings.py -> Hui,

Could you add a separate section for CBAS settings?

Line:2, tests/analytics_bigfun.test -> YCSB? I think you want create a new module and class for CBAS.

The attributed below (title, category, and etc) do not make sense either.

Line:21, tests/analytics_bigfun.test -> Why do you need these phases?

Line:186, perfrunner/helpers/cluster.py -> If we don't set the data path, by default, what is data folder after setup?

Line:194, perfrunner/helpers/cluster.py -> Done

Line:198, perfrunner/helpers/cluster.py -> This is required, otherwise, CBAS will not start with these folders created, i think the issue is that the folder created is owned by root and can not be access by couchbase group.

Line:171, perfrunner/settings.py -> I think this is part of the settings of a cluster though..

Line:2, tests/analytics_bigfun.test -> This is just a dummy test file for cluster setup only, there will be proper test files created after cbas automation is done.

Line:21, tests/analytics_bigfun.test -> Same as above, but I assume we still need items and workers settings in these 2 phases.. Loading will be the phase to load data. Access will be running queries...

Line:186, perfrunner/helpers/cluster.py -> There is no default. If user doesn't specify storage/data, then the cluster configuration fails.

I.e., this option is mandatory.

Line:171, perfrunner/settings.py -> Fair enough.

One of my comments didn't get posted.

You probably don't need new Iris, Hera, and Hestia specs for CBAS. If I recall correctly, you were going to use Ares.
