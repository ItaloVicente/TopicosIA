Line:10, cloud/infrastructure/serverless_3s_1c_c6gd_2xlarge_kv.spec -> Out of curiousity, how come you've got the node groups (and by node groups I mean the ns_server sense) this way? 

In a serverless cluster, each KV "subcluster" should be spread across 3 AZs, with one node in each AZ, and which I believe is mirrored by the node groups - so I would expect to see kv:1, kv:2 and kv:3 unless there is a specific reason

Line:10, cloud/infrastructure/serverless_3s_1c_c6gd_2xlarge_kv.spec -> Interesting... I think in any case for serverless the node groups will get overwritten. For consistency I think its best we remove the node groups from the ends of this

Line:10, cloud/infrastructure/serverless_3s_1c_c6gd_2xlarge_kv.spec -> I don't remember why it is like that. I think I might have taken the specs from another review and it had it like that and I just didn't change it.

Line:486, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> An alternative way to write all of this would be to do

```
for bucket in self._bucket_names:
    if bucket not in buckets_to_skip:
        db = ...
        ...
```

I think your way is technically faster though, so no complaints :)

Line:486, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> Oh yeah true about the "most efficient way". Here I think readability is the priority, not efficiency (as is the case with most python programming :P)

I think both the current way and the way I suggested in my first comment are both pretty readable.

I'm not sure its worth putting the code in another function here for the sake of a single if statement, and I definitely don't think its worth doing the two for-loops.

Line:486, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> It's only faster in the cases where we have no buckets to skip.
Technically the most efficient way of writing this would be
 if buckets_to_skip:
    for bucket in self._bucket_names:
        if bucket not in buckets_to_skip:
            db = ...
            ...
 else:
    for bucket in self._bucket_names:
        db = ...
        ...
This avoids the extra loop when we have buckets to skip making it more effcient. The issue with the above is code duplication. We can avoid it by showing the 
 db = ...
 ...
code into another function.
 def kv_timing(self, collector: str, bucket: str) ->list[int]:
   db = ...
   ...
   return timings
The question is how much does it impact readability? No point in being super efficient when nobody can understand and maintain the code. What do you think?

Line:2321, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> ooh you could use Python's dictionary merge operator and just do 

```
self.test_config.serverless_db.update_db_map(existing_dbs | dbs)
```

Line:894, perfrunner/settings.py -> Ah this is a good point - there is an `update_db_map` method but then no way of getting the updated db_map.

right now, lots of places in perfrunner use the `db_map` property, but it doesn't get updated by update_db_map.

I feel like there are two ways of proceeding:
    1. remove the db_map property and just rely on get_db_map
    2. make update_db_map actually set self.db_map = db_map, and just stick with using the db_map property everywhere
