DESCRIPTION:

CBPS-953: Inconsistent test cases

cbbackupmgr tests using default collection (bucket tests) are configured
with compaction enabled, but their counterparts that use collections/scopes
did not have compaction enabled, so the test results were not directly
comparable.

Collection/scope tests for cbbackmgr now have compaction enabled for
comparability with the bucket tests and to reduce test length.

Additionally, the include_data setting has been removed from the test
configs, since the default action is to backup all
collections/scopes/buckets anyway, so specifying all scopes/collections
as we were is redundant.
