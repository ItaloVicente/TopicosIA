DESCRIPTION:

Address CBPS-953: Inconsistent test cases

cbbackupmgr tests using default collection (bucket tests) are configured
with compaction enabled, but their counterparts that use collections/scopes
did not have compaction enabled, so the test results were not directly
comparable.

Collection/scope tests for cbbackmgr now have compaction enabled for
comparability with the bucket tests and to reduce test length.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I don't think you need 'Address' here. I'm not sure what the general consensus is for 'perfrunner' but we usually use some form from the following:
1) CBPS-XXX Msg
2) CBPS-XXX: Msg
3) Msg

IMO you should have the CBPS in the title though 👍

Line:32, tests/collections/tools/tools_backup_100M_rift_1000s_1000C.test -> UNRELATED: Honestly this seems a bit ridiculous, from the look of the test cases, the intention is to backup all the scopes/collections created by 'perfrunner'; this is the default behavior. So you'd achieve the same affect buy omitting the '--include-data' flag entirely.

Line:32, tests/collections/tools/tools_backup_100M_rift_1000s_1000C.test -> This is probably unfair/bad wording on my part. To revise, we should probably avoid using hard-coded values like this; it's prone to error, hard to maintain and could be easily generated at runtime if required.

This may well be a failure of the 'cbbackupmgr' documentation, which is completely fair; I've opened DOC-9303 to address this by making it clear that the default behavior is to backup all available scopes/collections.

Line:32, tests/collections/tools/tools_backup_100M_rift_1000s_1000C.test -> Yeah, knowing the default behaviour, this is somewhat absurd. I originally thought for this file that we had 1000 scopes and 1000 collections PER scope, of which we were only backing up a subset. This is not the case however (and I'm not sure how much sense that would make anyway). I shall enquire - I do suspect that we could just remove it though.
