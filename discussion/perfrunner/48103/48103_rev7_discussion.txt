DESCRIPTION:

remote.py: Accumulate env vars used control Couchbase's behavour

There are a number of environment variables which can be used to
control Couchbase's behavour, such as COUCHBASE_NUM_VBUCKETS,
MEMCACHED_NUM_CPUS and others.

Previously these were applied by calling `couchbase-server retart`
with the one env var for that purpose set. This is fine if only one
restart is needed, but if multiple things require a restart then the
first env var would be 'lost'.

Solve this by maintaining a dictionary of all environment variable set
thus far, and always apply them all on every restart.
