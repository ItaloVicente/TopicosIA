Line:11, scripts/setup.sh -> I wouldn't nest URL inside toy. I think the full URL itself decides ultimately which RPM gets installed, or at least when I run with --url I do not specify toy at all. toy itself must have been a prior effort to search for toy RPM in some centralized location. Not sure about the history behind it ...

My point is. User should (and be able to) use either toy or url. And not have to say toy when he really just wants URL.

Line:15, scripts/setup.sh -> nitpick: This is going to be bash environment variable. Somehow I personally prefer that the name is something more descriptive than just url so that other programs won't set it, and user can tell what this is about. Something like install_url, cb_url, perfrunner_url, etc etc ... any name you like ... but something longer is preferred.

This is not a required change.
