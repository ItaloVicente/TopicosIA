The FTS port should part of the cluster configuration, not of the test configuration.
Line:14, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> I guess flake8 will complain about the formatting (the sub-dict of `planParams` looks strangely indented), but that's a minor thing.

I'm not sure if the `u`-prefix is really needed. Without it it would be easier to read, but feel free to leave it like that.

Line:32, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> The fts port should be part of the cluster setting, not of the test setting (see other commit). Looking at this code I think you would have direct access to the cluster setting via `self.cluster_spec` so you wouldn't even need that other change.

Line:35, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> Is the `dict()` needed? Isn't it already a dict?

Line:14, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> Yea. Let's move on.

I took the slash-escaped json string from earlier, converted it to dict, then prettyprint the dict. Didn't think I should go the extra step to un-unicode things.

Line:32, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> Interesting point. I guess I forgot about that. Thanks. This enhances my awareness of the logic behind all this. I need to find out what this ./cluster_run business is all about too ...

Line:35, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> Making a copy. Because I capitalized DEFAULT_FTS_CREATE, so I didn't want to mutate it.
