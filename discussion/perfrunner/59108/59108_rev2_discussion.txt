The -2 is for the hard-coded port.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> If there's an Jira issue for it, please reference it.

A better commit message would be one describing what the FTS test case does.

Line:11, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> That's pretty bad. The port shouldn't be hard-coded but a config setting (just as the name). When hard-coded you will never be able to run it against a cluster started by ./cluster_run.

Line:13, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> If you make it a Python dictionary, you wouldn't need to escape so many quotes and you could also set the index name via `DEFAULT_FTS_CREATE['name'] = index_name`.

Line:35, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> I think `FtsIndexText` would be more pythonic.

Line:80, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> It case you change the class name it would need to be changed here as well.

Thanks for the feedback. Will work on it soon.
Line:11, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> Will do.

Line:13, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> Will do. This is the original cut and paste from FTS UI which generates the sample curl command. I could turn this into Python source-friendly code in Python dictionary format, easily.

Line:35, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> Will do. Should have changed this w.r.t to the other reviews I sent.

Line:80, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> Will do.
