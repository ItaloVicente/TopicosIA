The -2 is for not having the port in the cluster settings.
Line:15, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> I think there was a recent breaking change, this is now no longer a string, but also JSON, hence it can be encoded as proper dict (which can lead to lines <80 characters :)

Line:32, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> It should be part of cluster settings `self.cluster_spec`, and not the test settings `self.test_config`. This way you can run the test on different clusters without changing the test itself.

Line:15, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> If I read Steve's email on that breakage correctly, it is backward compatible in terms of taking the input. It breaks only when it returns a real nested JSON instead of a JSON where values are encoded JSON-strings. So in my case where I am sending data to the API and not taking responses, I think it's fine. 

Since this is internal to the test (no other tests get broken because of this), you think we can move on for now, and I'll fix it later if it really becomes an issue?

Line:32, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> Will try dynamically discover port.

Line:32, perfrunner/tests/fts.py -> That would be the best solution!
