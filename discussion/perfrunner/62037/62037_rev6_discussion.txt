(34 comments)
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Wouldn't it make sense to have a proper Jira issue for such a big change? You could also expand the commit message on which tests you are adding.

Line:103, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> Nitpick: identation is a bit off

Line:466, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> To be more consistent, `.format()` should be used.

Line:467, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Hard-coding ports normally isn't a good idea, it would be better if you could get the port from some config setting (just think about someone running it with cluster_run).

Line:840, perfrunner/settings.py -> Would it make sense to remove that setting in a different commit? So then it is clear that it got removed with all corresponding usages.

Line:489, perfrunner/settings.py -> I would expect that changing a default value breaks a lot of things. Changing default values need a lot of sanity testing. Have you done lot of testing with different test suites?

Line:554, perfrunner/settings.py -> Why is the `fts_config` needed? It would be best if there are as little attributes added as possible as the PhaseSettings class is already so bloated.

Line:853, perfrunner/settings.py -> There's a space missing before the `0`.

Line:855, perfrunner/settings.py -> For me it isn't clear what `query_size` means. Is it the number of returned results? Is it the number of queries? I also haven't seen it used in any other file, so perhaps it's just a left over and can be removed completely?


There's a space missing before the `10`.

Line:168, perfrunner/tests/__init__.py -> You should make this conditional, as it is done with the `spatial_settings`. This way the object won't have that many unset attributes and you can do a check on the existence later on (in case that's needed).

Line:1, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Would there be a better name name for this file rather than `fts1.py`? Perhaps just `fts.py`?

Line:70, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> It should be camel case `FtsTest` to be more consistent.

Line:85, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Space is missing before the equal sign.

Line:86, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Please don't hard-code the port, but get it from the cluster configuration. Why is it different from `self.host_port`?

Line:91, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Why is it a class property although it's hard-coded and used only once? You can just hard code the sleep down there with `20`.

Line:94, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Why do you call `delete_index()` although it doesn't do anything?

Line:105, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Looks like a left-over.

Line:111, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Shouldn't it log at least a warning if it is called although it's not implemented?

Line:121, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Please keep line <80 characters.

Line:123, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> You can also write `if r.status_code != 200`.

Line:124, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Why is `URL` and `HEADER` uppercase and `data` not?

BTW: you can use "URL: {}".format(self.index_url) to be more consistent with the rest of perfrunner.

Line:129, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Superfluous space before the parameter.

You might want to add a comment why there is a sleep after creating the index. Normally polling is better than just sleeping.

Line:136, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> You don't need the `True`, you could just write `while retry < 3`.

Line:137, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> There should be spaces around the `+`.

Line:138, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> You can write `if r.status_code != 200`.

Line:146, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Please keep lines < 80 characters. I would put the space after the `:` and not before it.

Line:151, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Why is there the same log message as in line 149?

Line:178, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Thre shouldn't be a space before the first and after the last parameter.

Line:182, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> The name should be camel case to be more consistent with the rest `FtsLatencyTest`.

Line:187, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Looks like a left over.

Line:193, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Indentation seems a bit of.
The dbname looks wrong, shouldn't it be something wit "fts"?

Line:197, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> The name should be camel case to be more consistent with the rest `FtsTroughputTest`.

Line:202, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> Looks like a left over.

Line:210, perfrunner/tests/fts1.py -> The name should be camel case to be more consistent with the rest `FtsJmeterTest`.

I suggest that you run `flake8` on the code base, to make sure you haven't introduced any new warnings.

Line:855, perfrunner/settings.py -> Oh, I found the `query_size` in spring. As it seems to be called `size` in FTS, the name is fine.

Line:840, perfrunner/settings.py -> I found it in spring. It's OK to remove it here.
