Line:42, cbagent/collectors/analytics.py -> Should it be self.cluster_spec.capella_infrastructure?

Line:10, cloud/infrastructure/capella_gcp_analytics_template.spec -> remove space

Line:44, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> remember to remove this line

Line:366, perfrunner/tests/__init__.py -> Why do you want to exec_n1ql_statement() from rest.py to __init__.py? exec_n1ql_statement() isn't removed from rest.py.

Line:1055, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> It should be done as separate patch

Line:8, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> Where is CapellaAPI class

Line:103, perfrunner/tests/eventing.py -> try running N2N test with this patch , i doubt it might fail

Line:84, perfrunner/tests/eventing.py -> we pick all the default values for backward compatibility, remove all the new params

Line:94, perfrunner/tests/eventing.py -> What will be the RBAC use for eventing

Line:141, perfrunner/tests/eventing.py -> it might break backword compatibility

Line:172, perfrunner/tests/eventing.py -> are we not measuring latency ?

Line:212, perfrunner/tests/eventing.py -> Timer create is different then timer response , we are measuring response only. Timer create >= Timer response

Line:1, tests/cloud/eventing/timer_throughput_sbm_bktop_512B_context_capella_eventing.test -> Any test run for this test

Line:42, tests/cloud/eventing/timer_throughput_sbm_bktop_512B_context_capella_eventing.test -> remove ;

Line:43, tests/cloud/eventing/timer_throughput_sbm_bktop_512B_context_capella_eventing.test -> Same as above

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks for the comments guys :) As you can see we are still quite limited by Capella, and even more so with Capella GCP
Line:42, cbagent/collectors/analytics.py -> In this class we can't directly access a `self.cluster_spec` property. We can either access it through the RestHelper like I've done, or I can initialise `self.cluster_spec = test.cluster_spec` within the __init__.

I can do the latter option if you'd like, but I know that this method works too, since I got stats with it: http://cbmonitor.sc.couchbase.com/reports/html/?snapshot=couchbase1_703-7031_sync_eeaa#48bc89aee0d73b83736fcc258781b190

Line:10, cloud/infrastructure/capella_gcp_analytics_template.spec -> Ack

Line:1055, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> Sure, though I thought it wouldn't be a big deal since its just a typo

Line:8, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> https://github.com/couchbaselabs/CapellaRESTAPIs

We can pip install it, and I've put it in requirements.txt. This is the repo that Ritesh made.

Line:44, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> Ack

Line:366, perfrunner/tests/__init__.py -> So this is a slightly weird one, which I think I may be able to solve in a nicer way now that I know a bit more about the Capella APIs.

This started with the following problem: the usual rest.exec_n1ql_statement method doesn't work with Capella, as that REST API endpoint is inaccessible. The best solution I found at the time was to use an SDK (the python SDK) to execute N1QL queries when we are using Capella.

This meant that I created the SDKHelper class with its own `exec_n1ql_statement` method, and kept the `rest.exec_n1ql_statement` method for non-capella scenarios. In order to efficiently select the appropriate method depending on whether we are running a Capella test or not, I created this extra `exec_n1ql_statement` method here in __init__.py, which would call either `sdk.exec_n1ql_statement` or `rest.exec_n1ql_statement` as appropriate.

I have since realised that we may be able to execute N1QL statements on Capella using the proxy API (part of the internal API), which would be a nicer solution as I could get rid of the SDKHelper class. I can test that, but maybe only after I have got my results for GCP.

Line:103, perfrunner/tests/eventing.py -> I moved this out to https://review.couchbase.org/c/perfrunner/+/175952/40/perfrunner/tests/__init__.py#67

Capella tests ran, so that's something: http://showfast.sc.couchbase.com/#/timeline/Linux/cloud/eventing/GCP

You are right to be suspicious though, because we have a number of ways of specifying whether to use encryption. We have ssl_mode and we also have enable_n2n_encryption. I can make the logic in __init__.py more robust to these different methods (or to be honest we should really just standardise on one method). I know for example that `rest.py` uses `enable_n2n_encryption` a LOT.

Line:84, perfrunner/tests/eventing.py -> This is a necessary step for Capella because Capella is a bit dodgy - from testing + discussions with Jake Rawsthorne (QE, doing eventing stuff on capella too) we need to specifically add these new params (with their default values) when we create an eventing function on Capella. Otherwise, Capella complains.

I know that Capella shouldn't complain, but it does - hence the new params.

Line:94, perfrunner/tests/eventing.py -> We don't have the ability to edit RBAC settings for users on Capella.

Users on Capella are handled a bit differently. We cannot specifically set the RBAC roles so this code fails on Capella. I had no choice but to disable it.

Line:141, perfrunner/tests/eventing.py -> It will be worth testing, for sure - I know that this setting has been used in testrunner by QE since before Capella, so it shouldn't break anything. If it does, we'll have to set it conditionally because Capella requires it currently.

See https://review.couchbase.org/c/perfrunner/+/175952/comments/3a6c33ec_be051235

Line:172, perfrunner/tests/eventing.py -> Until I figure out how to, not yet. We have extremely limited access to eventing stats in Capella.

Line:212, perfrunner/tests/eventing.py -> We cannot directly get the timer response stat on Capella.

In the eventing source code it seems that the two are equivalent: https://github.com/couchbase/eventing/blob/fcb77ec347ca6324b735c8fa42748368f06de0c3/consumer/protocol.go#L508

Do you have an example where they are different?

Line:1, tests/cloud/eventing/timer_throughput_sbm_bktop_512B_context_capella_eventing.test -> Two in fact, just not from jenkins: http://showfast.sc.couchbase.com/#/runs/timer_throughput_sbm_bktop_512B_context_capella_eventing_capella_gcp_eventing_template/7.0.3-7031

Line:42, tests/cloud/eventing/timer_throughput_sbm_bktop_512B_context_capella_eventing.test -> I can either remove this `[stats]` section entirely or keep it commented out for now.

We cannot do SSH on Capella GCP at all yet, and even on AWS we haven't got SSH collectors to work, so enabling this is not an option right now.

Line:43, tests/cloud/eventing/timer_throughput_sbm_bktop_512B_context_capella_eventing.test -> See above comment: https://review.couchbase.org/c/perfrunner/+/175952/comments/7108b19a_748c4669

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:366, perfrunner/tests/__init__.py -> Hmm, I've tested this again and noticed that the REST endpoint for running a n1ql query works.

Not sure what happened last time then. I've removed this and the SDKHelper class because they are no longer needed.
