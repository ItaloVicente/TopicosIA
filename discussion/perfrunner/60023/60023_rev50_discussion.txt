Line:366, perfrunner/helpers/cbmonitor.py -> Please remove if this code isn't needed.

Line:254, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/

Line:486, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> Please remove if this code isn't needed.

Line:493, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> Please remove if this code isn't needed.

Line:568, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Interesting approach... 

Although it's really hard to understand what kind of information you get from iptraf. Would you please describe the current methodology?

Line:570, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Please split this string and use for loop instead.

Line:576, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Please avoid print statements. Use logging instead.

Line:578, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> I don't think this is best way to check if the process is running...

Line:588, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Please don't print.

Line:589, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Can we use Python to parse the output?

Line:599, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> This line seems redundant.

Also we probably should create a separate function. We have too many similar "killers".

Line:230, perfrunner/tests/kv.py -> Please don't print.

Line:232, perfrunner/tests/kv.py -> I believe we already have pretty_dict function.

Line:39, perfrunner/tests/subdoc.py -> Why do you create these objects here?

Line:43, perfrunner/tests/subdoc.py -> What does "body" mean here?

Also this method has way too many duplicate lines. You should consider refactoring.

Line:74, perfrunner/tests/subdoc.py -> Please avoid print statements.

Line:4, requirements.txt -> Does it mean that the official SDK hasn't required API?

Line:23, requirements.txt -> Does it actually exist?

Line:43, perfrunner/tests/subdoc.py -> It looks like "access" phase.
