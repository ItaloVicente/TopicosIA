Line:13, cbagent/collectors/fts_stats.py -> self.no_result ?

Line:23, cbagent/collectors/fts_stats.py -> Consider using sessions instead.

Line:359, perfrunner/remote/linux.py -> Please note, you still need to get a new drive for backups.

Line:799, perfrunner/settings.py -> As discussed, you probably don't need this.

Line:801, perfrunner/settings.py -> As discussed, you probably don't need this.

Line:223, spring/cbgen.py -> You don't really need all those leading underscores.

Line:246, spring/cbgen.py -> It looks more like get_template().

You can implement this as a property:

    @propery
    def template(self):
        return self.FTS_QUERY_TEMPLATE

Line:252, spring/cbgen.py -> Hm, your already have

    self.auth = HTTPBasicAuth(self.username, self.password)

Line:255, spring/cbgen.py -> url = node['hostname'].split(":")[0] ?

Line:290, spring/cbgen.py -> I would suggest to fix this over-indented block since you are refactoring code anyway.

You have 8 spaces instead of 4.

Line:369, spring/cbgen.py -> If you rename this to QUERY_TEMPLATE then you can re-use/inherit "set_template".

Line:371, spring/cbgen.py -> Redundant.

Line:454, spring/cbgen.py -> As discussed, these exception handlers do more damage than help.

Line:626, spring/wgen.py -> https://github.com/couchbase/perfrunner/blob/master/spring/wgen.py#L154
