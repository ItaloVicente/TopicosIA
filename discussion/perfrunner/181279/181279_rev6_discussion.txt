DESCRIPTION:

Use AMI names instead of IDs for AWS

Keeping track of AMI IDs in our deployment scripts is a pain. Its
better for us to use AMI names in our scripts, and use Terraform's Data
Sources to lookup the correct AMIs to use based on the name.

This patch is a simple implementation of this which just looks up the
exact AMI name that is in terraform.py.

In the future, this can be made more sophisticated, e.g. to be able to
lookup "client-ami-*" with a wildcard, and selecting the most recent one
(this can be done using Terraform).
