DESCRIPTION:

Generate profiling pdfs and attach to build artifact

Changes the following:

* Removes previous code related to profile collection (and associated setting)
* At the end of the perf run, collect profiling info from endpoints and save as pdfs
* Create and download profile data pdfs in the form of a .tar.gz file so they are attached as artifacts
