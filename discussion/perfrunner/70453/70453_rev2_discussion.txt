Line:8, tests/dcp/kv_dcp_throughput_200M_DGM_four_conn.test -> If I understand correctly you going to use Ares cluster which has only 64GB RAM.

First of all, we really should use the same cluster for DGM and non-DGM cases. That really helps to avoid confusion.

Also, 60000 is a too dangerous and highly not recommended quota . To make this test more realistic you need to reserve some memory for OS, other processes, disk write queues, DCP queues, and etc. You will intermittent issues with 60000 quota and 200M documents.

"For optimal performance, it is recommended to leave a buffer from at least 20% between the quota size and the physical RAM size."

Line:17, tests/dcp/kv_dcp_throughput_200M_DGM_four_conn.test -> This is redundant, you don't have views.

Line:8, tests/dcp/kv_dcp_throughput_200M_DGM_four_conn.test -> I am planning to use hera_xl cluster for this test, as we have to use same cluster for both DGM and Non-DGM tests.

Line:17, tests/dcp/kv_dcp_throughput_200M_DGM_four_conn.test -> Done, will remove it.

Line:8, tests/dcp/kv_dcp_throughput_200M_DGM_four_conn.test -> In this case you are facing another problem - memory quota is too low.

The resident ratio will be low (DGM) but most documents will be cached by OS. I.e., disk reads will be significantly faster than in real production scenarios.

You either need smaller physical RAM size (e.g., Hera KV node) or higher memory quota (the ~80% rule).
