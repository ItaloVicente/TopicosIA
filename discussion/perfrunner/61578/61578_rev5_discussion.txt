Line:4, requirements.txt -> This change could potentially break a lot of tests. Have you tested it with some of the tests?

I would make this change in a separate commit to make sure things work across all tests we are running. Having a separate commit has the advantage of having a clearer commit message and it would be easier to find/revert.

Line:4, requirements.txt -> Thanks Volker.
I'm not planning to merge this commit now because we need to get python sdk release that include https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-python-client/commit/12467124a620c23317f64dc8c11c8495aeec0da3

for now RYOW commits are used in separate jenkins job http://perf.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/hades-dev-ryow-from-src/

before merging I cleanup the code and put couchbase sdk changes in separate commit.
