Line:64, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> I kinda think this is a little unclear / explicit - as the caller of this function has to know to ensure a host string needs to be set. I think it would be better to change to explicitly pass the host to use - something like:


    def detect_os(host):
        with settings(host_string=host):
            os = run('python ....')

Line:547, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Note: rpm will take a URL as a direct argument - this will remove the need to cleanup the downloaded file manually.

Line:555, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> This might be a case where piping `yes` into the script may be a nicer solution.

Line:52, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> Do we know the client OS at this point? If so we could make this condiional on Centos

Line:64, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Done

Line:547, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Done

Line:555, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> I've tried that. Unfortunately the bit where it is failing is where it attempts to install GPG keys, and it flat out refuses to do that while unattended unless you pass it -y in it's initial args.

Line:52, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> Done
