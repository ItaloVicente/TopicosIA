it specifically addresses Centos & Ubuntu, but doesn't handle MacOS or Windows ...  can these be included as separate cases?

For certain runs you need even more things installed. This is what you need for Ubuntu12:

numactl sysstat atop

Those are the once I've identified when using the vagrant vms [1]

PS: atop isn't listed there, the reason is that I currently don't have wiki access as it was moved from couchbaselabs to couchbase.

AFIAK we don't have any existing perf infrastructure clients which run anything other than CentOS or Ubuntu, so this seems be a somewhat unreasonable requirement.

Dave: There are at least ShowFast results for Windows. Though I agree that this is great for now and Windows can be handled (if ever) at a later stage.

Yes - for the /server/. This is adding support for installing things on the /client/ machines, which are 100% Linux at present (and I know of no plans to change that).

Oh you're right.

Adam, this also means that you should ignore my earlier comment about installing additional packages. Those are needed on the server not on the client.

I don't think I can approve perfrunner stuff, hence a +1 only :)

Thomas, do you still think this isn't worth having? I don't want patches to rot in Gerrit, I would rather merge or abandon them.

Line:521, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> without Windows, this will cause a problem.  without MacOS it will be an inconvenience or more.
