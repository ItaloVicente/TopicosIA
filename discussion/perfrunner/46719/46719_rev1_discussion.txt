DESCRIPTION:

Fix flake8 errors

I dug into this, and it doesn't actually look like it was due to recent commits.  For example, one of the errors it complained about was from a while back:

https://github.com/couchbaselabs/perfrunner/blame/677f68aecacad78adc3fc76e2d7b886506d99576/perfrunner/tests/multitenancy.py#L49-L51

My theory is that the flake8 tool itself was upgraded, and more rules were added, which caused the failure.

the value of changing from 'lambda' to f(v) declaration where both return the same result is unclear, and only related to the reported flake8 error by virtue of using the lambda operator.  (i.e.,g lambda is a conditional expression, the second a function declaration)  can you provide details on the error reported leading to this, the reference only highlights the use of lambda in a separate python object, and why wasn't the change proposed here, also done to multitenancy.py?
i am hesitant to change something that is stylistic until i understand the rationale

Here are the flake8 errors that triggered these changes:

The warning regarding lambdas is explained here:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25010167/e731-do-not-assign-a-lambda-expression-use-a-def

My changes regarding converting the lambda expressions to functions implement the same change recommended in the SO post.

The changes were applied to all code that triggered the flake8 errors.
