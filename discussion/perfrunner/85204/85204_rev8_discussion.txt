DESCRIPTION:

Collect logs before restarting the servers

Usually we run cbcollect_info after the test completion. However,
servers have to be restarted at the end of the test when custom
memory settings are used. Many kv-engine and ns_server stats are
not persisted and hence being lost.

We should collect the logs before resetting the memory settings.
