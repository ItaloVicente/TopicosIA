I'd also consider expanding your commit message to describe in more detail what this new setting does.
Line:118, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> I don't know if the phases are important, but perhaps revert back to this message?

Line:84, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> I'd be tempted to make this fatal - the problem with warnings is people normally ignore them ;)

Moreover given that these are used for performance tests it would be pretty undesirable for someone to accidentally select the wrong cluster config and not realise they are running with half as many clients as they expected.

Line:89, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> same here

preserve logger designation of 'phase'
Line:119, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> each phase can have a different setting

To use multiple workload clients, what would the [ clients ] section look like in the cluster spec?

for-my-own-understanding: docgen in Spring is based on a random key, so each client in a multiple clients scenario will generate different documents (no overwriting), correct? So it's the number of documents that matter in the mind of a user. In this case, if one specifies 20M documents, is it going to generate `20M * number of clients` documents? Or does each client generate `20M / number of clients` so that the total is 20M?

Just dabbling here ...
Line:104, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> not-certain-if-required: Is there any good reason to save (then restore) the state of state.env.host_string before overwriting it? 

nice-to-have: Actually, I don't know how myself, but if one could find out how to send commands to a host in Fabric in an object oriented way, it would be nice. Instead of relying on this global variable ...

I'll set about properly documenting the feature in the commit message (and maybe readme?) so it is more properly explained. The cluster client topography can be changed on a per-phase basis, so there is no need for a [clients] section, currently it is using a clients_per_cluster entry in each of the phases and uses a syntax identical to the initial_nodes entry for xdcr tests, ie a space delimited sequence of numbers. For example setting clients_per_cluster = 1 2 would assign 1 client to the first cluster and 2 to the second, and this can be changed in every phase. If a configuration is not specified it simply falls back to one client per cluster. I am certainly open to suggestions on how to expose the functionality, this seemed to have the most backwards compatibility and similarity to the current syntax.

You are correct in your thinking about docgen, currently it will duplicate the number of items specified in the config. So 20M * number of clients.
