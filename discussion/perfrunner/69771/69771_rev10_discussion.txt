DESCRIPTION:

CBPS-222: Post test results directly to ShowFast

ShowFast has a little control of what is stored in the database
when data is sent directly from perfrunner to Couchbase Server.

That causes the following problems:
* Sometimes data is stored in incompatible or corrupted format.
* It's very hard to make changes to data model.
* It's nearly impossible to support multiple data models at the
same time (i.e., API versioning).

Currently, ShowFast provides API for both date storage and
retrieval. It makes sense to keep only one component responsible
for maintenance of test results.

Example of usage:

http://perf.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/hera/225/console
