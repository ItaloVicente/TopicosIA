DESCRIPTION:

Use local workers by default

Currently, most tests use the same host for workload management
and also for workload execution. Quite often engineers forget
that distributed workloads are not really required. There is no
point wasting time on initialization of remote workers.

Perhaps only XDCR tests with ongoing workload still need "--remote"
flag.

This change is not backward compatible. All existing jobs should be
updated accordingly.
