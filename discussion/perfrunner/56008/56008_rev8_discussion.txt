One minor comment and then I think this is ready to merge. There might be a few other things we will need to tweak, but I think we should look at the full test results before doing so.
Line:415, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> The restore_path should be retrieved from the config. I think just reusing the backup_path parameter you added is fine.
