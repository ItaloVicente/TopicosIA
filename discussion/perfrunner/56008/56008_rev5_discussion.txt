Line:397, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Our default backup strategy should be to take a backup of the entire cluster from a single remote machine. This looks like we take the backup on each server node.

Line:398, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> The backup path should probably be configurable because we will need to test on different disk types. Since we usually mount the drives we want to test with we will be unlikely to use the /tmp directory.

Line:404, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Remove print

Line:408, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> Use the rest credentials from the config for username and password.

Line:36, perfrunner/tests/cbrecovery_restore.py -> Should be a log message. There are also other print statements in this file that should also be log messages.

thanks Michael for your comments
Line:397, perfrunner/helpers/remote.py -> no, we backup entire cluster from the client machine here. for example: we have 1 client and 3 nodes cluster. we backup the entire cluster only from the client.
