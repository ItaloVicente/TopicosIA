DESCRIPTION:

CBPS-630 Merge test improvements

This commit removes the flush between backups to give
a more realistic backup/merge scenario.
This also adds configurable threads and storage flags
for merge. The threads flag will be ignored for builds
pre 6.5.0-3198, where this was introduced. Setting the threads
to the number that is used by backup should maintain conistency
with previous tests, due to the way thread count was determined before.
