DESCRIPTION:

CBPS-430: Interrupt local workers via SIGPWR

Latency stats are not persisted until the task (workload) is
complete. That becomes a problem in some scenarios when workload
is running indefinitely in background.

This patch introduces graceful cancellation via SIGPWR signal.

Please note, we can't use Celery API (e.g., cancel()) because they
are not supported by sqlite broker.
