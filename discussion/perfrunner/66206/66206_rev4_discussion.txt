DESCRIPTION:

Fix for netstat which might fail if the machines in cluster have different ip routes configured. Cbagent fails to get the dev stats when this is the case. The fix is to get the default ip route for each of the machines as oppossed to getting from 1 of the machines and using the same ip route for all the machines.

Fixed review comments and build failures
