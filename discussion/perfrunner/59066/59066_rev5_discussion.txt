Line:841, perfrunner/settings.py -> It is in the [`fts`] section. So I think it would be enough to just call it `port` as it will be clear that it's the fts port.

The port setting should be part of the cluster configuration, not the test configuration. See inline comment for more.
Line:841, perfrunner/settings.py -> Sorry, I'm wrong. This setting shouldn't be part of the test configuration, but of the cluster configuration. Else you won't be able to run the same test config on another cluster configuration (like a local ./cluster_run cluster.

See my new inline comment. The new change with the FTS port isn't needed in this change.
Line:841, perfrunner/settings.py -> After looking into http://review.couchbase.org/59108 I think this change isn't needed at all as the test itself has access to the cluster configuration.
