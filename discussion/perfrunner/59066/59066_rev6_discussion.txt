Line:335, perfrunner/settings.py -> I wasn't clear enough. It shouldn't be part of the test setting, but of the cluster configuration files. So that you can run the same test on different servers, without changing the test files. If it isn't clear, let me know.

Will go with the dynamic route. Didn't like adding one more section in cluster spec just for this one setting. It feels like a headache even with picking a new name for a new section.
Line:335, perfrunner/settings.py -> I asked around and it seems pools/default/nodeServices can tell me the port of fts (hopefully no other trickery there for using this).

 
{"rev":30,"nodesExt":[{"services":{"mgmt":8091,"mgmtSSL":18091,"fts":9110,"capiSSL":18092,"capi":8092,"kvSSL":11207,"projector":9999,"kv":11210,"moxi":11211},"thisNode":true}]}
 

Originally this was my approach, but is now no longer the case, but I am keeping this comment just in case:

It looks like I should create a new section in cluster spec, as none of the current sections seem to be a good fit. Please advice if you have any name suggestions. I am thinking of creating a general purpose section [services] and an option named fts_port = 9110 there.

Line:335, perfrunner/settings.py -> Discovering it dynamically would be the best solution.
