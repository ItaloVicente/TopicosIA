Looks good overall, just some minor things that could possibly be tidier. There are quite a few commented-out lines of code (not actual comments) that perhaps should be removed if they are not needed - I pointed out one or two but there are a fair few more.
Line:162, cbagent/collectors/syncgateway_stats.py -> Its not a very big deal by any means, but I guess this is supposed to be "metric_name".

Line:294, perfrunner/helpers/cbmonitor.py -> Could we just remove this line?

Line:618, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> If we don't need this line then perhaps we could just remove it?

Line:1221, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> Is there a particular reason why os.system is used here instead of local()?

Line:45, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> I think this whole if statement could be simplified to "self.sgw_test = test.sgw_test", since in the PerfTest base class, the "sgw_test" property is a bool:
https://github.com/couchbase/perfrunner/blob/2721f61222d20371508d1d8a3af230aa631870e4/perfrunner/tests/__init__.py#L55

To be fair though, again, this isn't *super* important.

Line:31, perfrunner/helpers/profiler.py -> Does this have a purpose? It looks a bit strange to set self.cluster_spec to the *class* instead of an instance of something.

Line:53, perfrunner/helpers/reporter.py -> Again, not really a big deal to be fair, but this could be moved out of the if statement, since in both the "if" and the "else" you set "cluster" to be the same thing.

Line:496, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> Is this used anywhere?

Line:45, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> Once this is merged, this cherry pick is not going to be necessary, so perhaps it should be removed once all testing is done and the merge is ready to go.

Line:367, perfrunner/settings.py -> I'm not sure that this is used anywhere, but it seems like it should be? Perhaps in reporter.py? That being said, I have no clue what the threshold even means, but it is a thing when we report benchmarks for daily tests: https://github.com/couchbase/perfrunner/blob/2721f61222d20371508d1d8a3af230aa631870e4/perfrunner/helpers/reporter.py#L152

Line:61, perfrunner/utils/deploy.py -> It doesn't seem like this is used anywhere - is it supposed to be? If not, I guess we can also remove the added cloud_sgw.ini file.

Line:162, cbagent/collectors/syncgateway_stats.py -> Done

Line:294, perfrunner/helpers/cbmonitor.py -> Done

Line:618, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> Done

Line:1221, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> Done

Line:45, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> Done

Line:31, perfrunner/helpers/profiler.py -> Doesn't seem to be used anywhere and yes, it is weird to be set to the class. I removed it.

Line:53, perfrunner/helpers/reporter.py -> Done

Line:496, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> Doesn't seem to be. Removed.

Line:45, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> Yup. I will remove it after everything else is done.

Line:367, perfrunner/settings.py -> It is used, but only for sgw tests( https://review.couchbase.org/c/perfrunner/+/156652/243/perfrunner/helpers/reporter.py#44 and https://review.couchbase.org/c/perfrunner/+/156652/243/perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py#56). Not sure why a different set of settings was created instead of using the normal one, but I think it is fine to keep it for now.

Line:61, perfrunner/utils/deploy.py -> You are right it isn't used anywhere and I think it can be removed, but I will ask Bo-Chun to be sure.
