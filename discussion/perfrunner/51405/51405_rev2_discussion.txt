DESCRIPTION:

Set the default indexer memory quota to 256

I originally set the indexer memory quota to the same as the data
service memory quota for backwards compatibility. Since it turns
out that the indexer memory quota wasn't being set anyways this
should be fine to do and won't break any existing tests.
