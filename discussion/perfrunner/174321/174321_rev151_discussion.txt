Line:4, cloud/infrastructure/cloud_aws.ini -> Why you have to change this

Line:811, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> once you killed all the memcached than stop is not a good idea. Do either of it

Line:380, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> you want to keep all the loggers ?

Line:44, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> Remove this

Line:70, perfrunner/tests/syncgateway.py -> Dont you need any stats

Line:4, cloud/infrastructure/cloud_aws.ini -> Because gcp doesn't accept names containing "_": http://perf.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/GCP-Mobile-Tester/1/consoleFull 
I thought it would be better to change the name everywhere for consistency rather than handle it differently for gcp alone.

Line:811, perfrunner/helpers/local.py -> I added the stop memcached call after running into this error: http://perf.jenkins.couchbase.com/job/GCP-Mobile-Tester/13/artifact/celery/worker_34.82.100.41.log where after calling killall, another memcached thread would be instantly restarted. I think 'systemctl stop memcached' should be enough, but I will run a test just to make sure of it.

Line:380, perfrunner/helpers/worker.py -> No. I will remove this one, as it isn't needed anymore.

Line:44, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> Will remove.

Line:70, perfrunner/tests/syncgateway.py -> We most likely do, but gcp runs break when enabling the collectors. I couldn't figure out why that happened, so I just disabled them.
