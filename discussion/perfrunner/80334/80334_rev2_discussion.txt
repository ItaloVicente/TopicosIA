DESCRIPTION:

Use installer's artifacts in test cases with tools

Currently, our performance tests are not aware of the package used
during the installation. They use REST API to detect the actual
version of Couchbase Server and then try to find the corresponding
packages using one of common locations.

Although that works just fine for release and development builds,
there is no way we can match arbitrary toy builds.

It's probably OK if "install" script saves the package locally and
the test extracts it later during the execution.
