DESCRIPTION:

Disable access log creation in warmup tests

Warmup happens slightly differently depending on whether there is an
access log present. The access log is generated at 2am GMT every day -
currently, it could happen (and has happened) that an access log is
created during the test, before the warmup phase. This then causes the
warmup phase to behave slightly differently to how we want it.

This patch disables access log creation for warmup tests to avoid this.
