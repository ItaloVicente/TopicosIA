I still see a bunch of differences between the test specs you have and what is defined in the google doc, but let's address these in a separate commit.

Actually it might be easier to address these here. Let's talk about this stuff diring the meeting.

Added more comments. We will need to change a few of the names of some of the tests, but we can do that once I can provide a way for you to get the average backup speed in MB/Sec.
Line:9, tests/backup_60M_CE.test -> mem_quota = 52428

Line:10, tests/backup_60M_CE.test -> initial_nodes = 4

Line:1, tests/backup_60M_folder_size.test -> Test case not needed.

Line:2, tests/backup_60M_folder_size_CE.test -> Can we name this: CE Full Backup (Backup Size GB): 1 bucket x 60M x 1KB

Line:9, tests/backup_60M_folder_size_CE.test -> mem_quota = 52428

Line:10, tests/backup_60M_folder_size_CE.test -> initial_nodes = 4

Line:1, tests/backup_60M_incr_workload.test -> Test case not needed.

Line:1, tests/backup_60M_incr_workload_CE.test -> This test case seems like the one that front end data operations running against the server while it is doing backup. Is this correct? If so I think this test case has the wrong name.

Line:9, tests/backup_60M_incr_workload_CE.test -> mem_quota = 52428

Line:10, tests/backup_60M_incr_workload_CE.test -> initial_nodes = 4

Line:9, tests/backup_60M_workload_CE.test -> mem_quota = 52428

Line:10, tests/backup_60M_workload_CE.test -> initial_nodes = 4

Line:26, tests/backup_60M_workload_CE.test -> throughput = 15000

Line:1, tests/restore_60M.test -> Test case not needed.

Line:9, tests/restore_60M_CE.test -> mem_quota = 52428

Line:10, tests/restore_60M_CE.test -> initial_nodes = 4

Line:1, tests/restore_after_incr_backup_60M_workload.test -> Test case not needed.

Line:1, tests/restore_after_incr_backup_60M_workload_CE.test -> I'm not sure that this is going to do what we want since the access phase is running during the entire backup and restore process. What we want is to load 60M items. Back them up. Then load 100K items and update 1M items, stop the load, and backup up again. Then we want to delete all of the data in the cluster and restore the incremental backup.
