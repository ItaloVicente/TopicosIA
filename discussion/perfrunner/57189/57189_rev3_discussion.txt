Also, I think we should rename the test that have _wrapper to have _ce or something like that since the names of the backup tools might change.
Line:1, tests/backup_60M_folder_size.test -> We don't need this test case because we will not be running tests that don't use cbbackupwrapper.

Line:2, tests/backup_60M_incr_workload.test -> We don't need this test case because we will not be running tests that don't use cbbackupwrapper.

Line:2, tests/backup_60M_workload_wrapper.test -> title = CE Backup with workload(sec): 1 bucket x 60M x 1KB

Line:1, tests/backup_6M.test -> We don't need this test case because we will not be running tests that don't use cbbackupwrapper.

Line:1, tests/restore_60M.test -> We don't need this test case because we will not be running tests that don't use cbbackupwrapper.

Line:1, tests/restore_after_incr_backup_60M_workload.test -> We don't need this test case because we will not be running tests that don't use cbbackupwrapper.
