DESCRIPTION:

Decouple metrics, reporters and timers

perfrunner has many cyclic dependencies. The "test" object is
being passed to the following helpers:
* reporters
* metrics
* cbagent

That is ugly and inflexible. This patch is the first attempt to
eliminate those chains.

First of all, the dependency between PerfTest and reporters
become linear. Weekly and daily reporters are complitely decoupled
as well.

This patch also make all MetricHelper method consistent. They
follow exactly the same output format.

Finally, reporters are no longer responsible for timings. @timeit
measures the phase timings when needed.
