DESCRIPTION:

CBPS-271: Generalize definition of Celery tasks

Originally, all Celery tasks were wrappers for spring workloads.
As our framework introduces new workloads, we should be able to
distribute them using Celery API.

I didn't really mean to make this massive change. While
trying to implement distributed pillowfight workloads I happened
to realize that I can easily leverage Celery tasks.

This patch makes all tasks more generic and as an example adds
a new test case with parallel pillowfight workers.
