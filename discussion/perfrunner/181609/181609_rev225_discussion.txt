File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Looks very good overall - just a couple of comments
Line:106, cbagent/collectors/sgimport_latency.py -> Apologies but this is going to be pedantic.

sg_db and api could be made into class properties, defined in the constructor. Then this repetition could be avoided

Line:1658, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> To avoid having to do this, it would be cleaner to override the `get_sgversion` method in either ProvisionedCapellaRestHelper (if this only applies for provisioned Capella) or CapellaRestBase (if it is required for both provisioned and serverless)

The same logic may apply to other methods you've edited in this file to support capella (i.e. it may be better to override in the capella class instead of having lots of `if self.cluster_spec.capella_infrastructure`)

Line:1408, perfrunner/utils/terraform.py -> I'm not sure if you often run Capella SGW tests in sandbox, but if you do then it can be useful to not have to specify the tenant ID and have it be figured out automatically.

Same for the access/secret key - it can be useful to have it be generated automatically, then jenkins jobs don't need to be updated if the sandbox is destroyed/redeployed etc. 

The `CapellaTerraform` class can do these things using a couple of extra methods, and some different logic in the constructor.

You may be able to inherit that functionality just by inheriting from CapellaTerraform and using its constructor, instead of inheriting from Terraform.

I don't know however if its wise to do that in this patch, or just leave it for a later patch so we can just merge this one.

Line:1424, perfrunner/utils/terraform.py -> I think we can remove this since we hardcode it to True, and I don't think we have an alternative to using the internal API for this

Line:106, cbagent/collectors/sgimport_latency.py -> Done

Line:1658, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> Changed this method.
Agreed about the others, it will be better to override them in ProvisionedCapellaRestHelper (no idea about serverless at the moment). Will do that in a separate patch.

Line:1408, perfrunner/utils/terraform.py -> Yes, you are correct, and that's a pretty good change to make. But I'd like to leave it for later now and merge the patch as it is.

Line:1424, perfrunner/utils/terraform.py -> Done
