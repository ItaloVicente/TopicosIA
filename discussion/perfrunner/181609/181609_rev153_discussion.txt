Line:1000, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> May be I am misunderstanding this, but if we only care per db counts in one of the case. Why are we looping through all dbs if syncGateway_import is there. Are we sure we're not reading the same value, or will this not happen for multi-db scenario?

Line:1002, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> nitpick: remove if not used

Line:1014, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Is there a reason we're manipulating json manually as string here? What is the json looks like here?

Line:1029, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> The way we get import value looks the same as function above and below. We can move this into a helper function maybe

Line:1240, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> nitpick: We can refactor this now since we have loops by moving the replication type check first and have a variable to know which blips to fetch.

Line:1245, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Do we need this many retries here?

Line:1257, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Same as above, why are we manipulating json as string?

Line:1284, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Same as above.

Line:1296, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> same as above

Line:1336, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> same as above

Line:1378, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> same as above

Line:1424, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> same as above

Line:1696, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> what is the reasoning behind not using the json result here?

Line:45, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> Dont forget to remove this

Line:210, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> I think this is not used anywhere anymore

Line:615, perfrunner/tests/syncgateway.py -> RemoteLinux has a cluster_spec, can we move this check there so we dont have to do it in every call?

Line:1659, perfrunner/tests/syncgateway.py -> nitpick: Can this one line log?

Line:1673, perfrunner/tests/syncgateway.py -> Were this for debugging? do we still need them?

Line:2384, perfrunner/tests/syncgateway.py -> I guess we dont need this function anymore in remote.py

Line:23, perfrunner/utils/deploy.py -> Does sync-gateway jobs use both deploy script and terraform?

Line:1376, perfrunner/utils/terraform.py -> nitpick: Looking at this constructor, may be this class should inherit from CapellaTerraform? Looks like some of the initialisation/functions you need is already done there. Is this used for non-capella setup?

Line:1379, perfrunner/utils/terraform.py -> Debugging log?

Line:1000, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> My bad on this one, that should be before the for.
I think 'syncGateway_import' is only for older sgw versions, before sgw 3.0 (or maybe before sgw 2.8, not sure on that now). The newer ones use 'per-db' and 'shared_bucket_import'. Given that we only ran multi-db tests for 3.0.3 and 3.1.0, we didn't run into this issue. 
Thanks for pointing it out. Fixed.

Line:1002, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Removed

Line:1014, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> For capella, metrics are reported in prometheus format, not json, so we cannot handle the stats in the same way. The only other place where prometheus is used is for analytics: https://github.com/couchbase/perfrunner/blob/master/perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py#L890 and it is also handled as string.
Also, due to the way they combine the results, every stat has 2 entries for each node, doubling the total number, so we need to divide by 2 to get the actual results.

Line:1029, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Yeah, that would improve code readability. Also should do that for E2E monitors.

Line:1240, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Good idea, modified.

Line:1245, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> More or less. Maybe 1200 is excessive, but in some cases there cases push and especially pull can start after a long time. This is mostly due to having a lot of cblites and documents on small sgw/server instances. Additionally, push has priority over pull(and pretty much every REST API call), which can lead to only push happening for a time. As far as I remember, most was around 900 seconds for pull. Let me know if you want me to decrease to about 600-900 seconds.

Line:1257, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Same, prometheus format.

Line:1284, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Again, let me know if you want me to lower it to around 600-900 seconds and what number would you prefer?

Line:1296, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Prometheus...

Line:1336, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Prometheus

Line:1378, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Prometheus.

Line:1424, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Prometheus.

Line:1696, perfrunner/helpers/rest.py -> As I said here: https://review.couchbase.org/c/perfrunner/+/181609/153/perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py#1014, capella only returns results as prometheus, not as json.

Line:45, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> Yup, will remove it when everything else looks good.

Line:210, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> Yes. I tried to use it for some E2E tests, as I need couchbase3 for import/PULL operations. That didn't work well, so I moved to the new branch (tmp-sqw-weekly-updated-c3) and that seems to work fine, so I will remove this function.

Line:615, perfrunner/tests/syncgateway.py -> Moved it.

Line:1659, perfrunner/tests/syncgateway.py -> I would like to keep this one separate, as it makes is slightly easier to understand the values at a glance.

Line:1673, perfrunner/tests/syncgateway.py -> Removed them.

Line:2384, perfrunner/tests/syncgateway.py -> No, we don't need it anymore.

Line:23, perfrunner/utils/deploy.py -> This patch is really old (since May), and back then we were using the deploy script. Terraform is newer and we only started to use it for sgw in November. Right now all jobs use the terraform script, but still think it's worth keeping the code here.

Line:1376, perfrunner/utils/terraform.py -> As far as I remember, I talked to Dan about it and we got to the conclusion that it should be fine either way.

Line:1379, perfrunner/utils/terraform.py -> Yeah, removed.
