DESCRIPTION:

Do not compact buckets after initial data load in GSI tests

This step seems redundant and only slows the tests down. It would
make sense to compact the data if the items were not 100% resident
(due to impact on DCP backfills). However, we avoid DGM-ness on
the KV side.

Note, other components don't use this step either.
