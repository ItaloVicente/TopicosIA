Line:1, Makefile_dcptest -> IMO, it makes more sense to use the existing Makefile.

It's OK to have generic targets for "go build" and "vendor sync".

Line:11, Makefile_dcptest -> Why do we need to fetch this dependency explicitly?

"govendor sync" should download all 3rd-party packages, right?

Line:16, Makefile_dcptest -> I don't think that we need to create a make target for every govendor command. Let's start with "sync".

Line:26, Makefile_dcptest -> Why not just "rm -f"?

Line:664, perfrunner/settings.py -> Why not "bucket-1"?

Line:40, perfrunner/tests/dcp.py -> Mahesh,

I thought more about running this test remotely.

IMO, we should simplify this scenario and run the DCP client locally:

* As I mentioned before, client machines are very powerful.
* DCP test should be generic. It should not require an index node.
* Local execution is way simpler.

Line:60, perfrunner/tests/dcp.py -> Please do not hard code credentials.

Line:74, perfrunner/tests/dcp.py -> Please read DCP stats from ns_server. They are more reliable.

Line:4, tests/dcp/throughput_dcp.test -> summary no longer used.

Line:5, tests/dcp/throughput_dcp.test -> This attribute no longer used.

Line:17, tests/dcp/throughput_dcp.test -> How long does it take to stream 20M documents?

Line:19, tests/dcp/throughput_dcp.test -> 80 would make data load faster.

Line:1, scripts/dcptest.go -> As I mentioned before, please create a separate folder for go packages. Do not use "scripts".

Line:4, scripts/dcptest.go -> Please group imports. E.g.:

import (
  "fmt"
   "os"
)

That is a more conventional way.

Line:31, scripts/dcptest.go -> Please "gofmt" your code.

Line:56, scripts/dcptest.go -> Do you really need this?

Line:58, scripts/dcptest.go -> Do you really need this?

Line:214, scripts/dcptest.go -> Please don't added commented out code.

Line:1, Makefile_dcptest -> created new target in Makefile as dcptest to build dcptest.
If we get more go tests in perfrunner, we can add more targets and if needed one high level target to build all go targets.

Line:11, Makefile_dcptest -> "govendor sync" does not get all source files in vendor folder.
Incase of indexing, we are using many modules inside secondary folder, we need that code to compile dcptest.

Line:16, Makefile_dcptest -> Done

Line:26, Makefile_dcptest -> Done

Line:664, perfrunner/settings.py -> Thought of having it default as this bucket will be there for new couchbase-server installation, for offline testing purpose.
But yeah we can make bucket-1 as we mostly create cluster using perfrunner and it creates bucket-1.
Done

Line:40, perfrunner/tests/dcp.py -> Done

Line:60, perfrunner/tests/dcp.py -> Done

Line:74, perfrunner/tests/dcp.py -> This file shows the throughput calculated while getting dcp message(all) by dcptest client.
ns_server stats does not show for dcptest client, it shows dcp stats for 2i, fts, xdcr etc. separately.

Line:1, scripts/dcptest.go -> Created go folder and moved this file to go/dcptest
Or
shall we create this inside perfrunner folder?

Line:4, scripts/dcptest.go -> Done

Line:31, scripts/dcptest.go -> Done

Line:56, scripts/dcptest.go -> Thought of keeping it, in case we have to debug it if this case has trouble

Line:58, scripts/dcptest.go -> Thought of keeping it, in case we have to debug it if this case has trouble

Line:196, scripts/dcptest.go -> We may remove this method as this is used only for printing different kind of messages

Line:214, scripts/dcptest.go -> Done

Line:4, tests/dcp/throughput_dcp.test -> Done

Line:5, tests/dcp/throughput_dcp.test -> Done

Line:17, tests/dcp/throughput_dcp.test -> Will fine tune this once I run few times in nyx cluster

Line:19, tests/dcp/throughput_dcp.test -> Done
