Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Mahesh,

Why do you need this information in commit message?

How do you end up having multiple change identifiers?

Line:26, Makefile -> Redundant. See below.

Line:27, Makefile -> Please move the top of the file.

Line:30, Makefile -> "scripts/dcptest.go" doesn't exist.

-o $BINARY would make sense if $BINARY was not equal to "dcptest". That flag is otherwise redundant.

Line:33, Makefile -> I started with the following experiment:

    > rm -fr vendor
    > govendor init
    > govendor fetch -tree github.com/couchbase/indexing

I've got the following vendor.json:

https://gist.github.com/pavel-paulau/32b6e1021a0a6752d24038aea1a26bc7

So now I remove all external packages:

    > rm -fr vendor/github.com

and re-sync:

    > govendor sync

and build:
   
    > go build go/dcptest/dcptest.go

and run:

    > ./dcptest 
    2016-11-13T21:48:14.333-08:00 [Fatal] please provided -kvaddrs
    Usage : ./dcptest [OPTIONS] <cluster-addr> 
    ...

I still don't understand why you need explicit "govendor get".

Line:39, Makefile -> Why does it require clean-dcptest?

Line:42, Makefile -> It probably makes sense to extend clean instead.

Line:1, go/dcptest/dcptest.go -> I think it's more common to name such files as "main.go".

Line:5, go/dcptest/dcptest.go -> Imports are organized in groups, with blank lines between them. The standard library packages are in the first group.

https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#imports

Line:31, go/dcptest/dcptest.go -> Golang opt-in for camelcase.

I.e., it should be numMessages, numConnections, and etc.

Line:78, go/dcptest/dcptest.go -> typo -> Please provide.

Line:272, go/dcptest/dcptest.go -> gofmt should have triggered an error if you have too many empty lines.

Line:1, perfrunner/tests/dcp.py -> Imports should be grouped in the following order:

standard library imports
related third party imports
local application/library specific imports
You should put a blank line between each group of imports.

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports

Line:25, perfrunner/tests/dcp.py -> No need to over protect.

Line:44, perfrunner/tests/dcp.py -> All commands are currently abstracted from the test case.

All commands are currently defined in module "local" or package "remote".

Please check how test cases in module "tools" are implemented.

https://github.com/couchbase/perfrunner/blob/master/perfrunner/tests/tools.py

Line:63, perfrunner/tests/dcp.py -> Mahesh,


"run" method should only contain top level execution steps.

Take a look at other cases:

https://github.com/couchbase/perfrunner/blob/master/perfrunner/tests/n1ql.py#L84

https://github.com/couchbase/perfrunner/blob/master/perfrunner/tests/kv.py#L36

Such structure helps to understand what the test is supposed to do and then to drill down if needed.

Line:70, perfrunner/tests/dcp.py -> Similar problem.

Please follow "report_kpi" convention.

Line:1, tests/dcp/throughput_dcp.test -> The test name should start with "kv" so that we can later match it in showfast.

Line:6, tests/dcp/throughput_dcp.test -> Is it enough for 20M documents?

Line:21, tests/dcp/throughput_dcp.test -> Matches defaults and non-informative, hence redundant.

Line:22, tests/dcp/throughput_dcp.test -> Redundant empty line.
