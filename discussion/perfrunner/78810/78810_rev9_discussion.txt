Please also make build bot happy.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> It would be nice to add a few examples to the commit message.

Line:4, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> getopt is probably the least popular parser in Python.

Please consider argparse or even docopt.

Line:5, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> See how logging is used in other perfrunner modules.

Line:7, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> You need to add libcloud to the project requirements.

Line:12, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Why do you need a custom exception class?

Custom exceptions make sense only if somebody catches them.

Line:24, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/

Line:85, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Why 2?

Line:90, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Why not to use __init__ for initialization?

Line:98, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Try keeping lines shorter than 120 characters.

Line:100, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Default argument values should be immutable.

"is_my_node" doesn't reflect what this function actually does.

Line:119, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Why do we need to sleep exactly 20 seconds?

Line:123, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> "r" is probably redundant.

Line:136, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Too many spaces before count.

Line:140, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> I think you need to specify the file format in the commit message or in the docstring.

Line:147, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> How do you know that sleeping 5 minutes is always enough? 
Would it be possible to have more reliable / deterministic approach?

Line:156, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Why exactly 2 minutes?

Line:181, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> I think we need to read keys from the environment (e.g., AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY).

CLI args are insecure due to logging.

Line:191, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> What is "name"?

Line:193, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> We don't have a requirement to customize the region.

Line:212, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> It makes to list your utility in setup.py.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:5, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> used logger.info

Line:7, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Done

Line:85, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> it as initially used as 2 , because one server , one client. now it is removed.

Line:90, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Done

Line:123, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Done

Line:136, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Done

Line:181, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> yes we should read from environment, it is fixed now

Line:191, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> name was initially used to track the instances. When the instance starts , it start with a  name which is a tag, so user can search it based on tag. Unfortunately that was not working properly. So name as argument is not needed.

Line:193, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Done

Line:212, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Done

Line:4, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Ok , good point . I will use that

Line:12, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Custom exception class is used to represent errors in meaningful way, but what you say makes sense. the tool will be called independently, so we need it

Line:24, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> will use this

Line:119, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Changed

Line:140, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> File format is CSV

Line:147, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Done

Line:156, perfrunner/utils/cloud/cloudrunner.py -> Changed to a deterministic approach
