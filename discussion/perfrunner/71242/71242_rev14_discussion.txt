DESCRIPTION:

CBPS-215: Assign unique cluster names to different phases

OK, this patch does more than what the commit message says.

cbmonitor no longer uses timestamps in snapshots. Currently, it
plots *all* data regardless of from_ts and and to_ts attributes.
That doesn't work well for tests with multiple phases.

Instead of creating pseudo-unique snapshot identifiers we could
create unique cluster names. This is what this patch does.

Unfortunately, the existing code for stats collection is messy and
ugly. I had to clean up a lot of code before making any actual
changes.
