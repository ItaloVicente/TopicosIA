Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please update the commit message so that it doesn't include previous commits from Mahesh.

Right now the summary of your commit is "Add Eventing stats".

Line:2, clusters/hwanalytics.spec -> Are you sure that you want to check-in this spec?

Why not something based on Ares?

Line:65, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> Maybe I am missing something but I don't see where you specify the unit of measurement. ms? us? seconds? minutes?

Line:601, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> Jeez, this looks so complex. Maybe there is a way to make the test output more parsing-friendly?

Line:117, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> Why do you need this wrapper?

It doesn't seem to add any value to _get_num_items.

Line:37, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> Don't forget to remove this.

Line:60, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> It probably makes more sense to refactor clone_ycsb.

It could be just:

    def clone_git_repo(self, repo: str, branch: str, worker_home: str)

Line:288, perfrunner/tests/cbas.py -> Instead of passing two nearly identical arguments you could dynamically generate a new metric name:

    title.lower().replace(' ', '_')

Line:302, perfrunner/tests/cbas.py -> This is not going to look nice.

Line:2, tests/bigfun/bigfun_load_10m.test -> Title usually summarizes the test case. For instance, mention BigFun, #nodes, #items, and etc.

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:2, clusters/hwanalytics.spec -> Will remove it.

Line:65, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> This is in sec, will change the var name.

Line:601, perfrunner/helpers/metrics.py -> The query running tool generates a result file that is tab seperated and the same query is ran for multiple times, one result per query run. And the logic here is trying to find average latency of the same query across different runs.

Line:117, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> I added this to be public, because initially i want to call it in test class instead of here.. For now i am not using it, but i was thinking maybe it will be used later. Not sure if this against our convention..

Line:37, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> Will do,

Line:60, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> I was thinking about this.. but the parameters might be different for other tools used for testing though... and the parameters are different.

Line:288, perfrunner/tests/cbas.py -> Done.

Line:302, perfrunner/tests/cbas.py -> Done

Line:2, tests/bigfun/bigfun_load_10m.test -> Done

Line:117, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> it seems with a leading _, _get_num_items is protected.. i am not sure if later on there might be test scenario that needs to call it from out side monitoring class, that is why i did not remove the public one yet..

Line:60, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> for bigfun actually there are 2 git repos needed syncing.. in other tools case (for example), they might involve installation say brew or pip which is not just git..

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:117, perfrunner/helpers/monitor.py -> The existing method is not really private, though. It can be used in the test classes.

I would recommend not to add unused code.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:60, perfrunner/remote/__init__.py -> Why are they different? In all three cases the following arguments are used:

* repo

* branch

* worker_home
