DESCRIPTION:

Suppress repeating errors in the client library

Despite its name, @quiet can produce a bazillion warnings even
when non-fatal errors occur. That makes the test output unreadable
and pretty much useless.

Instead of reporting every singe exception we should accumulate
them for a short period of time (e.g., 10 seconds) and report an
aggregated warning:

[WARNING] Function: read, error: <Key='000000000098', RC=0xD[The key does not exist on the server]>, repeated 900 times

This new tracker is obviously not thread-safe but we probably
don't care if a few exceptions get lost. We don't measure the
exact error rate anyway.
