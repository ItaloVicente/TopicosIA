DESCRIPTION:

MB-33730: Add Analytics Deep Comparison Tests

- Add Analytics deep comparison tests and compare the
  result with query service for the following cases:
  - Constant arrays/objects comparison
  - Order by arrays/objects
  - Group by an arrays/objects using sort-group-by
  - Group by an arrays/objects using external-hash-group-by
  - Join on arrays/objects
  - Deep comparison of the "=" expression on arrays/records

- Add test cases for SQL++ undefined comparisons which are
  expected to evaluate to null. These test cases results are
  not compared with query service as the semantics for those
  cases are different between analytics and query service.
