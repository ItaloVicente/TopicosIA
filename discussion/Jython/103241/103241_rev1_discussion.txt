Line:16, pytests/cbas/cbas_upgrade.py -> Add testcases for upgrade with failover method.

Line:505, pytests/cbas/cbas_upgrade.py -> Since this code is common to few other tests as well, it would be good to have it as a separate public method to avoid duplication of code.

Line:168, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> should this be centos 7?

Line:16, pytests/cbas/cbas_upgrade.py -> We only support rebalance out and swap rebalance for Analytics. Graceful failover is not supported for Analytics. The same is mentioned in Upgrade PRD

Line:505, pytests/cbas/cbas_upgrade.py -> Done

Line:168, pytests/newupgradebasetest.py -> Done. This was an existing file that came in from test runner repo when Jython repo was created. I just picked the diff from the latest test runner code of this file. I am not using most of the code from here.
