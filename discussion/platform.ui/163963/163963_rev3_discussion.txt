DESCRIPTION:

Bug 562645 - NPE at org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt.StackRenderer.adjustTopRight

ToolBarManagerRender/MenuManagerRenderer keeps an administration between IContribution items and model items. This should be an 1-to-1 relation between instances. However, HashSets were used. For contributions items with overridden equals methods this results in a broken 1-to-1 relation.

Fix: use IdentityHashMap which was designed for this kind of use cases.

Is this now planned for 4.17 M1?

Given the amount of duplicate bugs that are coming in, surely.
