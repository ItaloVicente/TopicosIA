DESCRIPTION:

Bug 530129 - Update genmodel for Bug 484398

Opening the UIElements.genmodel leads to several changes which were
related to changes in the application model. I assume the committers did
not have the EMF tooling installed hence the missing change.

Ed, I get these changes if I open the genmodel. I guess the changes in the app model in 4.7 were not reflected in the genmodel. If I do not here someone say "STOP" I plan to merge early M6.

Yes, I changed the behavior of the GenModel editor.  It has always auto-reconciled the model when you open it, so when you generate it generates all the proper things, including for any new things added to the Ecore model. But now it does it this using a change command so that if the model is changed during reconciliation, the editor shows as dirty.  This way users don't have to worry about doing Reload... manually or doing hacky things like change a property and then change it back to save the reconciled state.

So yes, it's a good idea to commit the properly reconciled version of the *.genmodel.
