What about my method name feedback from the other Gerrit?

> What about my method name feedback from the other Gerrit?
Didn't forget. The name to create the actual control is "createIn(Composite parent)". I'm afraid the names are to similar (create and createIn) but they do different things. Create the factory vs. create the control.

I only reviewed the ButtonFactory, please check and apply to all factories.

Please add also Snippets to the jface snippets in this Gerrit so that we can see this API in use during the review.
Line:40, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/ButtonFactory.java -> Method for setting the LayoutData is missing.

Line:69, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/ButtonFactory.java -> Should IMHO be removed, newButton(SWT.PUSH).text(t) serves the same purpose.

Line:81, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/ButtonFactory.java -> Should IMHO be removed, newButton(SWT.PUSH).image(image) serves the same purpose.

Line:121, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/ButtonFactory.java -> Make no sense to pass style again.
Why not only create or add as method name.

Line:40, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/ButtonFactory.java -> In super class.

Line:69, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/ButtonFactory.java -> I thought as a short cut...
Will probably be the most used factory method.
Like dog.getTail().wag() vs. dog.wagTail()

Line:81, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/ButtonFactory.java -> as above.

I agree that there shouldn't be a factory method for every use case. That would make the fluent methods ad absurdum. But for the most common cases?

should we leave them in or remove?

Line:121, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/ButtonFactory.java -> style is private member of super class. super class calls this method to create the actual control. hence style is not a duplicate.

In general still thinking of the method name for creating the factory itself (newButton...) and the actual creation of the control in its parent (createControl()). I want to prevent to similar names (from the word perspective as well as from the semantic persepective)

I don't think modern API uses overloaded constructors but use the fluent. I'm most familiar with Mockito which uses this approach.

So IMHO the additional constructors should go unless you can point me to a popular framework which uses this approach.
