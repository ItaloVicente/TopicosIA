What is the idea of having the createControl(Composite parent, int style) method? This is just a wrapper around the new operator and cannot be chained with further calls. I suggest to return here also the Factory so that more calls can be chained. Otherwise I do not see a use case for this method and would suggest to remove it.

Hi Lars,

it is protected. Maybe polymorphism is overused here?
The create(Composite c) method is located in abstract ControlFactory. I calls the protected abstract method createControls and gives the given Composite and the private style. Afterwards it calls a method to apply all the properties.
Normal OO business I think.

Refer to ControlFactory.create(Composite c).

Do you have a better idea? Actually we could do it with lambda. In the constructor of ControlFactory we can have a supplier function for the actual creation. Just another style of programming. At the end the createControl method would vanish.
