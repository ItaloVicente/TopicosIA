Line:359, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TreeViewer.java -> Please make sure any new API comes with an example or concrete use-case covering it.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> It would be great if that internal part could be extracted into a separate review, independently of API.

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes, ideally one commit per "fix".

Line:5, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Please next time update your local workspace to have latest state from master before submitting the patch.

This change is not needed anymore.

Line:23, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/pom.xml -> Same here

Line:359, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TreeViewer.java -> I'm not convinced regarding the method in general & more or less empty javadoc (compared to org.eclipse.jface.viewers.StructuredViewer.preservingSelection(Runnable)).

The code here duplicates org.eclipse.jface.viewers.StructuredViewer.preservingSelection(Runnable) which is protected.

So why do we need new API & why this API is called so differently to original one? If we need it in debug.ui concrete viewers only (that extend TreeViewer), can't we override the method and make it public there?

If that is a real need to make this protected API method to public *here*, that should be binary compatible (https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs_2#Evolving_API_interfaces_-_API_methods) but that would also means, we need to adopt some other places in the platform that already override this TreeViewer.preservingSelection(Runnable) method and "reduce" visibility.

I see at least two places in SDK that need to be updated (may be there is more, not sure):

/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui/src/org/eclipse/equinox/internal/p2/ui/dialogs/ContainerCheckedTreeViewer.java
/org.eclipse.debug.ui/ui/org/eclipse/debug/internal/ui/launchConfigurations/LaunchConfigurationViewer.java

Line:359, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/TreeViewer.java -> "preservingSelection" is not public and can not be used from outside the bundle without subclassing the Treeviewer which is NOT intended.
Preserving the selection is only one of probably more issues to be solved get get rid of O(n*n). Another thing are the calls to Tree.getItemCount() / setItemCount().
I have no solution for that yet but in general it would fit into "batchUpdate" but not into the "preservingSelection" semantic. Another solution woudl be to cache die itemcount on the Tree. But that's an implementation detail.
If you have total different solution for the debug view problem i am very open for other ways. I am no jface/swt guru. So might be there totally different and better solution.
