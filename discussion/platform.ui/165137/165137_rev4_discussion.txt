What specific tests should I do for this? I've run it with the patch applied and not noticed any obvious problems on macOS.

I don't remember exactly. When I did this change, I placed a breakpoint into the method and noted which parts of Eclipse use this and tested them. Maybe something to retest for early 4.20 as it might result in small, hard to notice layout issues.

By the way, you can mark your own change as 'work in progress' by doing one of two things:

* Push to refs/for/master%wip (you can push to refs/for/master%ready when done)
* Clicking on the ⋮ menu at the top right and marking the change as 'work in progress'

You can see this in Iacf436b420a9a7d8f8552ad4f9411021e5996ed7 for example

One benefit of doing this is that a change marked as work-in-progress can't be submitted by someone else accidentally 😊

I have a script shortcut at https://github.com/alblue/scripts/blob/master/git-push-wip and https://github.com/alblue/scripts/blob/master/git-push-ready if it helps
