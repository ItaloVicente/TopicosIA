See questions inline.
Line:144, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> Why is a guard necessary here? Is there an issue with calling notifyAll if nothing is waiting?
Also, is there a risk that `sleep` gets called after `done`? If so, we should probably keep a `done` flag and ignore sleep request when flag is true.
Another question is why even using notifyAll here? since both `wait` and `notifyAll` are made unable to run in parallel by using the same mutex, how can it happen that notifyAll does actually stop a pending wait since the notifyAll invocation won't happen when wait is running?

Line:144, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> OK right, I know understand that wait returns immediately and while it locks the current thread, it doesn't prevent other threads for notifying. Good.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:144, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> Guard is not necessary just a premature performance optimization: At the other bugs where i solved the same problem the committers forced me to avoid notify if not needed. if nobody is waiting we would not need to notify. On the other hand nobody would listen anyway. So i do not care whether we guard or not. Just let me know if you want such guard or not. I really do not care about nanoseconds when removing milliseconds.
If sleep is called after done (chances are small) it would wait 100ms as before. We can avoid that as you wish: patch2

Why notifyAll: as soon as one thread goes into wait() it is going into a state where it waits for notify. That is the key here! See for example https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1036754/difference-between-wait-and-sleep "waiting releases the lock on the object"
