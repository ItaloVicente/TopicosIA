DESCRIPTION:

Bug 563386 - Assure Display#removeFilter is run on UI thread

The bug report showed a situation where contextDisposed is called from a
non-UI thread. Calls on Display#removeFilter must make sure to run on
the UI thread. Assuring this by running syncExec() on the given Display.

MaximizableChildrenTag: Changed implementation of UISynchronize to the
one from E4Application#createE4Workbench.

Line:340, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/MenuManagerRenderer.java -> I think async exec would be enough here, beside this you have to check for disposal inside the async/sync block again

Line:340, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/MenuManagerRenderer.java -> I think this is fast enough to executed sync. And then the disposal check should not be necessary anymore. This is only required for async execution IMO.

Line:340, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/MenuManagerRenderer.java -> The api suggest that 
"the runnable to be invoked by the user-interface thread at the next reasonable opportunity"
That means it is not invoked immediately and other actions might take place (e.g disposal).

Later on this is also specified:
"Note that at the time the runnable is invoked, widgets that have the receiver as their display may have been disposed. Therefore, it is necessary to check for this case inside the runnable before accessing the widget."

It also contains the note that

"The thread which calls this method is suspended until the runnable completes"
SO I'm not sure if it is save to call syncExec when you are not 100% sure your are currently not on the event thread.

Thanks for this pointer. You are right. It is required to check for disposal then to be safe. I'll change that now.
