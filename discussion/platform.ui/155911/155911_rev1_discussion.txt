Line:298, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/registry/MarkerHelpRegistry.java -> this branch is only reachable in the corner that
bundle state == STARTING.

But we should also somehow be informed about if the state is currently RESOLVED.

Is there a different method to add a global bundle listener in a central place?

Line:298, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/registry/MarkerHelpRegistry.java -> If the bundle is not active, I think it also has no bundleContext. I did not debug this, but I think that is the case in Equinox. If that would be try, this branch is a no-op. 

Sebastian, can you debug if this branch is reached for bundles which are not active?

Line:298, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/registry/MarkerHelpRegistry.java -> RESOLVED is not needed *here*. We will just show that there COULD BE some resolution, *without* activating the generator.

As soon as user will try to "fix" the warning via MarkerHelpRegistry.getResolutions(IMarker), the  extension will be loaded and bundle will be activated.

Line:298, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/registry/MarkerHelpRegistry.java -> Lars, the bundle can be in STARTING state and this is what we want, so this is not a no-op.

AFAIK bundle will only be activated on class access if they have the Bundle-ActivationPolicy: lazy set in the MANIFEST

So think resolved is also needed

Line:298, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/registry/MarkerHelpRegistry.java -> I'm can't debug this at the moment but IIRC bundleContext used to be NULL also for bundles in the starting state.

Line:298, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/registry/MarkerHelpRegistry.java -> Right, the important bit is the null check above, which I have overlooked:

  if (generator != null && generator != GENERATOR_NOT_STARTED) {

That way, it should work correctly. This branch is then only relevant in the corner case where the plugin is just transitioning RESOLVED -> STARTING -> ACTIVE

Agreed, but seeing that the ACTIVE check was in there before bug 558297 already, we shouldn't change this in this fix.

No. *For sure* bundle will be activated if anyone will try to load any class from it, the header is only to allow LAZY activation strategy as opposed to immediate direct activation on class load.

As stated in the bug report, as by the example of ch.acanda.eclipse.pmd.java, the bundle stays in RESOLVED state even though classes are loaded from it.

Nope, that is not the case and a common misunderstanding of this flag. LAZY is the opposite of lazy it will activate on class access otherwise the plugin will never be automatically activated.

You can check this by opening the OSGi Console from the Console view and by typing "ss".

That is normal in Equinox. The OSGi spec is not very helpful here, it defines that a framework CAN decide to activate a bundle. Equinox decided not to do this, only the that lazy flag is set. Felix behaves differently.

OK, reading this https://www.osgi.org/developer/design/lazy-start/ and https://osgi.org/download/osgi.core-7.0.0-early-draft-2017-03.pdf I wonder how one can find out if the bundle is *supposed* to be activated if we load a class?

Only by checking bundle manifest at runtime? OMG.

Here is an excerpt from the spec: 

4.4.4 Resolving Bundles
A bundle can enter the RESOLVED state when the Framework has successfully resolved the bundle's dependencies as described in the manifest.

4.4.5 Starting Bundles
A bundle can be started by calling one of the start methods on its Bundle object or the Framework can automatically start the bundle  if the bundle is ready and the autostart setting of the bundle indicates that it must be started.

A bundle is ready if following conditions are all met:
• The bundle can be resolved
• If the optional Start Level API is used, then the bundle's start level is met.

Once a bundle is started, a bundle must be activated, see Activation on page 115, to give control to the bundle so that it can initialize.

4.4.6.2 Lazy Activation Policy

A lazy activation policy indicates that the bundle, once started, must not be activated until it receives the first request to load a class. This request can originate either during normal class loading or via the Bundle loadClass method. Resource loading and a request for a class that is re-directed to another bundle must not trigger the activation.
