I think the naming convention with a suffix number is really ugly in this case. But I don't know if there is a better alternative.

Alternatively we can suggest a breaking API change and increase the major version.

May by just "StringToNumber" instead of "StringToNumberConvereter2"?

One alternative it to use the same class name but another package.

Ex:

org.eclipse.core.databinding.conversion.text.StringToNumberConvereter

In the same way as the "typed" sub-packages for generified databinding classes.

On advantage is that migration is super easy: simple add a suffix to the pacakge name in the import.

> May by just "StringToNumber" instead of "StringToNumberConvereter2"?

I think it is better with a name that is more clearly derived from the original name.

Jens, can you push a proposal with the new package? I find it hard to implement the new API, as the deprecated classes are using by multiple base classes, e.g. UpdateStrategy and I hope that you as the main db developer can do this easier.

Okay, I can have a look at it during the weekend.

Awesome, thanks a lot. I tried yesterday for multiple hours but through away everything as the change was getting bigger and bigger and at the end I felt that it still would break API.

What did you see that would break API?

I see that existing functionality might change because the backing implementation changes (auto-converters in UpdateStrategy#getConverterMap). But I don't see any API breakage.

Also I don't think the classes in these internal packages must be preserved:

org.eclipse.core.internal.databinding.conversion
org.eclipse.core.internal.databinding.conversion

We can change them in place, and we can move those files to the other commit which change implementation.

I will await your answer, in case I have missed something here. Then I'll make those changes.

I ended up with multiple compile errors and API baseline errors but these might have been only because of the compile errors. If you think they don't break API and API tooling confirms that, that is good.
