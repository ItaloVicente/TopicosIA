I have adjusted the change, but after taking a closer look at the savehandler I'm a bit confused about the implementation at all:

1) the user is not really promted if requested to promt
2) instead promptToSave always returns YES so the check is a bit useless here.

It seems a very similar code is used as fallback in PartServiceImpl (PartServiceSaveHandler could be used instead...maybe providing static methods?) and also there is no attempt made to ask the user.

Even though ISaveHandler seems to over some abstraction to save, it is described as "not intended to be referenced by clients" and as it can only be injected in the PartService I wonder what the actual intention is (instead of simply hide the code duplication).

Stackrender also uses the save handler but if none was given falls back to part service with a different delegation by using the parts EclipseContext thus one might be able to inject another save handler here (if it wouldn't be discouraged) so a press on the save button (PartService) would behave different from a click on the close button with a dirty part...

I think this is a different story where this change is the wrong place for discussion.
prompToSave returns always YES here, but its subclass WBWRenderer actually does get user input.

If you feel that there is something buggy here then please open another ticket.

I think this change is here OK, as other error situations are also logged and lead to return false.
