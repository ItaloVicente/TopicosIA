DESCRIPTION:

Bug 567702 - Take IEclipseContext from 1st window when none selected

In certain situations during application startup no MWindow is yet set
as selected to the application. This lead to a NPE when assuming that a
selection always exists to get the context from. In those cases take the
context from the first window when existent.
