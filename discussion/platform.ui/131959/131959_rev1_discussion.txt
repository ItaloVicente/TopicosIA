Alex, which bug is it? The change is not trivial, so I prefere we would have an explanation why this is needed and have it on the bug.

I haven't opened a bug as there are direct usages of javax.annotations annotations in the code and what is done here just follows what is already done o.e.e4.ui.bindings/services, org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.addons.swt, org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt and probably others. It was working previously because PDE resolved javax.annotation from the jvm which can no longer happen. Do you insist on having a bug ?

Yes, I think a bug is appropriate for that kind of change
