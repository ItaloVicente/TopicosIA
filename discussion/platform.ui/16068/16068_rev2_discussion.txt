DESCRIPTION:

Bug 415241 - Suppress Symbolic links duplicates on the Tasks View

Added a checkbox "Suppress duplicates due to file system links" on
'Configure Contents' Dialog, that is visible only from TasksView and is
checked by default, and its functionality: The duplicate tasks are
removed, and the old/change tasks are removed from the list when the
project is refreshed and all its references are refreshed.

I have rebased the code locally. But I can't push since Lidia's ECA is not valid anymore.
Lidia, could you re-sign your ECA?

@Karsten: If you think it's good to merge, then I suggest you bring this question to emo-ip-team. I guess that the fact that ECA was signed at the time of the commit make it good enough for a merge. If IP Team confirms that, then we can merge directly.

For now, I just have rebased the work, not tested it yet. I saw that you commented on this really old contribution and thought there would be only low chances that this work would be rebased by the author.

Gerrit does reject a push with the following message. It won't be correct to remove the original author. I guess we would have similar issues with older Gerrit changes where the original author is not available anymore.

Would be great if you could start a discussion with the emo-ip team how such situations can be handled.

@Karsten Thoms @Mickael Istria
Hello, I am the author of this commit, thanks for interest in it.
How can I help to push it?
My email has changed meanwhile.
from lidia.gutu@windriver.com into lidia.popescu@windriver.com
Would this be the problem? Eclipse account has been updated.

Thank Lida for asking. I did not have the situation before. ATM the commit is conflicting with master. I would suggest that you get change, solve the conflict and commit it again. If you experience still this problem, open a new change and abandon this one.
Please give us some advice how this can be tested.
