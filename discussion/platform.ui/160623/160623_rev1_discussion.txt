Line:242, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.browser/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/browser/BrowserViewer.java -> why do you explicitly  exclude these? And why only these?

Line:244, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.browser/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/browser/BrowserViewer.java -> For unknown uri schemes this will do nothing (because no handler will be found).
Is this what you want to achieve? Or would be more correct to set doit = false only in case you really did handle it. If this would be need you need to change the "handleUri" method to return if it did handle the uri or not.

Line:242, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.browser/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/browser/BrowserViewer.java -> It's empirically the schemes that I actually managed to get working in the browser. I don't know (yet?) how to get the browser declare the supported schemes that it should handle itself, ignoring other scheme handlers.

Line:244, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.browser/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/browser/BrowserViewer.java -> Do I get it right that all the org.eclipse.ui.uriScheme are not API?
If they're not API, it looks like an issue since extension point reference one of this interface, which should then be API.
If they're API, then we can't change them any longer as it would break compatibility.

Line:244, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.browser/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/browser/BrowserViewer.java -> All this is not yet API because we wanted it to mature.
Also the ext. point is declared as "internal" at the moment.

But they are already used (e.g. bei Oomph and also SAP's ABAP Development Tools (I am working on) ).
So it would be "nice" if we don't break compatibility when we change that.
But maybe we should take this now as a trigger to make this "official" API.
