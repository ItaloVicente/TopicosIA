Hi Wim, I am pretty confident that this change works. First, the tool-tips for tool items are updated too (and that is unrelated to this change). Second, command-handlers and actions-handlers listen to the key changes themselfs, so most update anyhow. Third, update on the menu is also called when focus is restored to the main window and when the menu opens, so any remaining (including e4 handlers) will be updated too.

But if you like to test it, yes please.

Not sure if that is related (as I never switched keybindings to Emacs before) but if I switch to Emacs keybindings in a runtime Eclipse with this change Alt+W which is mapped to copy triggered the opening of the Windows Menu. I do not see that in my normal IDE. I'm actually not sure which behavior is correct nor if it is triggered by this change, or just a difference in runtime IDE to my normal IDE. 😕

This seems to be a regression indeed. Before the patch, the &W from Window is filtered, i.e. the W is not underlined when pressing Alt. After the change it is underlined. Depending on the selection, either the copy command or the open window is executed.
Need some investigation where this is originating from, though on top of my head: MenuManager.update() is a noop. While in other contribution managers this call updates all properties. Then the MenuManager.update(IAction.TEXT) must still be called to trigger the update of the accelerator.

Abandoned

The -1 Code Review has been pending for more than a year without any reaction to resolve it. That's a sign this got actually abandoned.
Please reopen if you're still willing to work on this patch.
