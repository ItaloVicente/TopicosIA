This does not work on Windows. I can press 'F2' to open it in a different window/dialog but as soon as I move the focus out of it, it closes like the original window.

Also, having a two line status text looks ugly.

Ok.

Would having the 2 pieces of information on the same line be good?

Depends on how long the line gets and then impacts the size for Quick Access.
