DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 552909: create a separate, clean MessageDialog

PlainMessageDialog is a replacement of MessageDialog.
Works with a builder pattern to create an immutable dialog.

Two usages of the new dialog in:
- File Association Preference Page: when creating an already existing
file association
- Perspective Preference Page: when deleting a perspective

Hi,

eventually some progress... Sorry for that. My job challenged me a lot.

I have converted it to a builder pattern now.
With that, the dialog becomes immutable.
The dialog itself is kind of simple without any knowledge about the kind of the dialog.

Everything has to be set up by the caller as you can see in the two example usages.

Now the final question:
Is that really what we want?

IMHO it got more complicated to setup a dialog.
Actually Lars was the one who triggered my so I hope you have an opinion on that Lars 😊
