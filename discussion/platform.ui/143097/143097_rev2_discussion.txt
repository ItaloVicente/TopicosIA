I'm afraid this introduces too much variability: the save being enabled on a current part could have different meanings according to things in the state that are too complex for user to get (whether there are ISaveableModel), as opposed to just whether the current part supports save.
What would be more interesting would be a way to have the ProjectExplorer not being understood or used as a ISaveablePart at all unless it actually have mechanics in that require save, so it wouldn't interfere in the save state.

I think we should instead implement "save" in Project Explorer differently, so that unless there is anything that's able to participate in the save process, it delegates the save action to the editor.
