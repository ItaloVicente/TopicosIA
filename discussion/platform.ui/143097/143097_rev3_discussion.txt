You mean, something like this ?

That's indeed much better and definitely on the right track in my opinion.
The patch still can make the ProjectExplorer behave in a not so clear way, in case 1. Project Explorer has a SaveableProvider extension and 2. it's sometimes returning empty results and sometimes non-empty ones. In such case, the save action would be sometimes saving the state of the editor and sometimes the state of the editor just because selection changed. We need to avoid that as it can drive to confusion. See comment inline.
Line:331, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/navigator/resources/ProjectExplorer.java -> I think we should also check 
  getNavigatorContentService().getSaveablesService().hasSaveablesProvider().

So if the CNF doesn't have any form of saveable mechanism in, we fail back to editor, otherwise, we keep fully using the CNF implementation.

the INavigatorSaveablesService.hasSaveablesProvider() should be added as API.
