After more thinking I've decided to move advisor.postStartup() call inside the run method of earlyStartup runnable. This way it happens before the early startup plugins are initialized, which seems more logical.

I don't quite understand the rationale for resuming the job manager only after the window is rendered. This kind of assumes that jobs are not needed for anything related to window rendering.

The behavior of Jobmanager.join(Object family, IProgressMonitor monitor) method, which silently ignores waiting jobs when the manager is suspended, seems pretty dangerous. It would be safer to throw an IllegalStateException if the manager is suspended and there are waiting jobs belonging to the family.
