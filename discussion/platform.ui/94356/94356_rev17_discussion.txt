Sorry Dani, my local revert again removes the default. Its fixed. What do you mean with the "type filter text" remark? "type filter text" is already shown when there is no text in the text field.

No, it is not.
1. Uncheck 'Clean all projects'
2. Close the dialog
3. Reopen the dialog
==> No affordance like in the Preferences dialog.

We find the current behavior of the preference dialog is Bug 302944 and IMHO we should not re-implement this behavior. 

We could take away the focus from the filter field, in this case the text would be initially visible but the user would have to select the field manually.

Do you prefer this?

No. It should behave like every other filter UI in our IDE (Error Log view is another example). Bug 302944 is unrelated and not about how the UI looks initially, but what happens when the user types "type filter text" into the field manually.

We have similar behavior of filter box in lots of places. Have a look at the "Installation Details" filter or the "Plug-ins" tab in a runtime configuration which behaves the same as the current implementation. IMHO using a fixed "initial" text is not a good approach. But if you insists we can (try to) reimplement this behavior.

There the filter field does not have the initial focus like in Preferences or Error Log. And in the Clean Dialog it is also clear that the filter field must have the initial focus.

Yes, I do. And it's also missing the 'Clear' button.

I see the clear button. IIRC SWT.ICON_CANCEL is not supported on Windows 7.

I don't using the latest patch set (17). And you are wrong. The 'Clear' icon works on Windows 7. I see it in the Preferences dialog and the Error Log view.

Looks like FilteredTree has a hack in it. See createClearTextOld in the class.
