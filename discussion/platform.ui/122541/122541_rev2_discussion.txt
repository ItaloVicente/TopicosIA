Our MANIFEST however requires 1.2

Your observation that DS annotations are not enabled is incorrect. It is not enabled per project but when the other components where created the DS annotation processor was enabled globally. The other DS components are created using the annotations as you can see in the implementation classes. Maybe you can deal with the issue by enabling DS annotation processing in the IDE globally instead of enabling it only for the project?
Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt/.settings/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.prefs -> the manifest currently requires DS >= 1.2 and < 2.0 ... so 1.3 is fine ... but actually I do not see a reason for 1.3 despite a tooling bug. And if you enable it globally instead for only the project, it should work

Dirk, DS annotation builder is not active by default at the workspace level in 4.8, so my observation is correct.

Sure, we can change workspace preferences in every workspace, but it is wrong to rely on the feature in the project without enabling this feature on the project level, therefore I've added the setting for the project.

Do you propose to enable the default value for the worspace in PDE DS code instead? If yes, this isn't part of this task and should go to the extra request.

The project management decided to disable that feature by default to avoid side effects for users that don't want to use it. I think your point is correct that at least the feature should be enabled on the project level if it is used, but then we have to change the settings of many projects, as I did not change that setting per project last year.

Only thing for this patch is that @Component should be used and the XML file should be generated to avoid that it is changed if someone changes the file at a later time when the feature is enabled. Everything else can be discussed in another ticket.

Sorry, I can't get it. What do you mean by that?

The @Component is already there, and auto-generation is enabled for the project now.

If that is the case then it is fine. I am just unsure about the project settings. Would need to checkout and verify if everything works with the generation.
