DESCRIPTION:

Bug 558417 - Ensure tree expansion after reading a log file

This solves a regression from Bug 553089. The original behavior was that
the tree gets expanded after the log file was read. This is done by
asyncRefresh. Also added the code to refresh and enable fFilteredTree to
asyncRefresh.
