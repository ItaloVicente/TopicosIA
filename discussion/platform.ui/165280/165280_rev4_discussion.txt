I'm not convinced this change on its own is an improvement to the theme. It basically adds 1 extra color and 1 extra line and isn't much more expressive IMO. It doesn't feel lighter then the current state.
I would rather see this new highlight used together with some other change to improve the theme overall, not just to introduce highlight "because we can".

Please open a new bug for reducing the number of colors. I'm a big fan of this but IMHO it is unrelated to the requirement of highlighting the active tab. Lets not deadlock each other....

I think that highlighting is not a requirement, and it's adding noise to the UI, reducing the quality. So I won't be enthusiastic about some patch that I perceive as adding load in the UI without clearly adding value/simplicity.
