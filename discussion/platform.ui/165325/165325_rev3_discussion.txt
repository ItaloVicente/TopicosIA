DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564535 - Use Label widget for message text in dialog header

Change field type of messageLabel to Label. This removes the behavior
that the dialog's message is selectable, can have a cursor and context
menu from Text widgets.

The former consideration of a Text's inner trimmings is removed as a
Label takes the full client area.

Added a test snippet to test the dialog with a long wrapped message and
ability to test clipping behavior by resizing.
