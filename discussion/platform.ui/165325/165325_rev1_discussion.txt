DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564535 - Use Label widget for message text in dialog header

Change field type of messageLabel to Label. This removes the behavior
that the dialog's message is selectable, can have a cursor and context
menu from Text widgets.

The former consideration of a Text's inner trimmings is removed as a
Label takes the full client area.

Added a test snippet to test the dialog with a long wrapped message and
ability to test clipping behavior by resizing.

Looks good to me. One reason I could think of why a text might be chosen is to make the text selectable to copy it. How do native dialogs handle this?

Yes, text selection will be the use case for that. I'm not aware where copying dialog titles is useful.
I've looked at other applications (Xcode, IJ, VSCode) and did not find examples for dialogs with a similar structure. And where dialogs had labels they were not selectable.
