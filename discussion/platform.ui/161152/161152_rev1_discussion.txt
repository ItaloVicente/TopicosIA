I know that you are not a big fan of e4, but may be we can make this cool feature available for e4 and non-IDE applications?
Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/EclipseCommandURIHandler.java -> What is the benefit from Job usage here? May be Display.asyncExec would be enough?

Line:69, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/EclipseCommandURIHandler.java -> This seems to need localization as potentially visible to user

About e4, I don't really mind; I'm more e4-agnostic and so far I didn't see a proof of goodness, but I'm not against it.
I'm not sure what being compatible with e4 and non-IDE application means concretely in that case. Can you please elaborate? Or if you want to take this patch and build a derivative as another Gerrit patch, feel free.
Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/EclipseCommandURIHandler.java -> Jobs allows to more easily hook a listener that's not necessarily in the UI Thread. With Display.asyncExec, then we'd need to start a new thread (or better, use a new Job) to run the command if user approves. So in the end, I think that the story of reacting in a non-UI Thread to some action happening in the UI Thread does require a Job anyway.

But I'm welcome to change that. Please share concrete code that you think could be better here.

Line:69, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/EclipseCommandURIHandler.java -> Right. I'll fix it in a future patch set (together with the changes for your other comments, once we more concretely know what changes have to be done).

With this Gerrit the registration and processing of "eclipse+command" will be available for installations that are a based on E3 IDE application. This is huge set, however this set will not contain eclipse applications that are not IDE-centric. The suggestion is to move this code to upstream bundle. E3 IDE will receive this functionality as well. As for concrete bundle to move this functionality in - we do not have ideal candidate at the moment, I think "org.eclipse.e4.ui.browser" would fit from my POW. But even registering this from "org.eclipse.ui.browser" will greatly extend the amount of functionality suppliers.
Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/EclipseCommandURIHandler.java -> You are using UIJob that internally will use `Display.asyncExec`
Job listeneres will be also executed in UI thread.
And all your code implicitly requires UI thread to show dialogs and so on.
From this point Job usage looks redundant.

The UriHander stuff is not dependent on the IDE. *But* there's the preference page on which a user has to enable handling of a concrete URI scheme. This is IDE dependent. The reason for this is, that we only needed it there (at the time of development). I know that Oomph in the meantime also has link handler and needed to re-implement the enabling of that in Oomph's code. So maybe there is potential for re-use.
