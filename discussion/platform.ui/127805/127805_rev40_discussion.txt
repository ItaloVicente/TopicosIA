DESCRIPTION:

Bug 531748 - Add type parameters to databinding

Add type parameters to relevant classes and methods in the
org.eclipse.jface.databinding and org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans
bundles.

This mainly includes the uses of observable and property classes,
but also observable label and content providers.

A separate commit updates the examples and tests.

Thanks Jens, looks very good to me. Examples, e4 tools and tests still compile also the customer project compiles without issues. Test are still passing.

I merge this so that we can ask more people to test this. I plan to merge the update of the tests and examples tomorrow so that the nightly build has a chance to identify more issues. 

Again many thanks for this sisyphus work.

One thing I was meaning to do is to look over the code in the new property factory classes.

Since they no longer need to be backwards compatible with the old classes, maybe there are small adjustments and improvements that could be done to then.

But that would be only minor changes and it is not very important.

Please provide new Gerrits. I felt it was important to finally merge your work so that others can easily test it. If we merge your before M3, I see no issues with them.
