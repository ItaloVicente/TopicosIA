DESCRIPTION:

Bug 531748 - Add type parameters to databinding

Add type parameters to relevant classes and methods in the
org.eclipse.jface.databinding and org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans
bundles.

This mainly includes the uses of observable and property classes,
but also observable label and content providers.

All examples and most tests are also updated.

I see some patterns here which should be thought about:
- When you use additional type args for methods (e.g. "E2", "V2") where the class has already similar type args (E,V), I think it is likely that you would like to use these type args instead of introducing additional ones. I commented some places but there will be more.
- When you use type args for Class parameters/variables (Class<E>), it is likely that you would also allow for subtypes (=> Class<? extends E). Using a bound type might be too restrictive.

I really appreciate your effort here. Please take my notes only as to consider, there might be reasons that your changes are better. When you rethought them I'll try to take another look.

Jens, I also think the E2,V2,... looks a bit strange. Any reasons why this was done? if not, could you update the change?

Hello Karsten and Lars! Thanks for the review.

I really appreciate to have someone to discuss these changes with. I have probably missed a few things that we might discover. There are also some design decisions I have made, which could be made in another way, and which I think will benefit from being discussed.

I have answered many of the comments bellow. I get back to you about the rest of the in the future.
Line:40, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/beans/IBeanListProperty.java -> > Shouldn't this be IBeanListProperty<S, E> values(String propertyName)?

No.

The whole point of those methods (value, values, list etc) is that they return a property of a nested object. The returned property has the same source type, but another value type. 

These methods are analogous to the methods with the same names in the property super-interfaces (IValueProperty etc). Those methods take instead a property objects as argument, but they are the same in that they return a property with a new value type (or element type). 

Example:

  class Person {
      String name;
      List<Person> children;
  }
  
  IBeanListProperty<Person, Person> children = BeanProperties.list("children");
  // Here it is clear that the returned property object 
  // should have String as element type 
  IBeanListProperty<Person, String> childrenNames = children.values("name");
  List<String> names = childrenNames.getList(personObject);

A design decision is *which* new type should return. Should it be an unbound type parameter? Or Object? Or a wildcard? I settled on an unbound type parameter. I'll get back to you at a later time about this subject!

Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/beans/IBeanListProperty.java -> I intentionally choose E2 because I think it is a better name. 

* It signals that it is an element type.
* The name is clearly derived from the old element type.
* T is not conversional as the name of an element type.

I you have a strong preference for changing these names to T then I'll be happy to do it. Otherwise I'll instead submit a patch for changing the names in the super-interface.
