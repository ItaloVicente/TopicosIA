DESCRIPTION:

Bug 531748 - Add type parameters to databinding

Add type parameters to relevant classes and methods in the
org.eclipse.jface.databinding and org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans
bundles.

This mainly includes the uses of observable and property classes,
but also observable label and content providers.

All examples and most tests are also updated.

Jens, despite your API filters you added, I see API warnings for the version. 
Description	Path	Resource	Location	Type
The API problem filter for: 'The minor version should be the same for version 1.5.0, since no new APIs have been added since version 1.4.300' is no longer used	/org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans/META-INF	MANIFEST.MF	line 1	Unused API Problem Filter Problem

Do you see the same message? I had issues with the API tools in the past, so this might be a local issue for me.

Despite that, I played with your code and it looks really good to me. I also imported the generified code into a (prohibitory) customer project and the change did not create any compile error. As the change is super huge I think we should release it as fast as possible so that more customers and projects can test the changes.

Jens, are you available to work on follow-up issues this huge patch may cause?

Spoke to early. 

The change makes some code invalid. The example I see is in the platform.ui.tools repo. If I do not pull in your change AbstractNewClassPage gets a compile error because the following construct from line 287 is not valid anymore:

	final Binding bd1 = dbc.bindValue(WidgetProperties.text(SWT.Modify).observe(tClassPackage),
					BeanProperties.value(PACKAGE_FRAGMENT).observe(clazz),
					new UpdateValueStrategy<>().setConverter(new StringToPackageFragmentConverter(clazz)),
					new UpdateValueStrategy<>().setConverter(new PackageFragmentToStringConverter()));

I see more such examples if I revert the changes in the databinding snippets snippets. Breaking clients is nothing we are allowed to do.

Jens, do you see a chance to break the changes into smaller ones, e.g., a change only for databinding.beans if that is a "safe" change? This would make it easier to integrate it. Or is everything to dependent?

I can have a look at the various API warnings tomorrow evening.

Great!

That's also great!

Whether clients get compile errors depends on a couple of things: Have they generified other parts of the code (such as UpdateXXXStrategy), do they assign property objects to local variables before calling `observe`, do they guess correctly regarding the type when assigning a formerly raw property object to a local variable, do they pass the result of getClass() directly to bean type parameter.

> Jens, are you available to work on follow-up issues this huge patch may cause?

Yes, absolutely. I'll make it a priority to fix any urgent problems. And I'd be happy to work on additions that might be useful. For example, it might be a good idea to add something that makes it easier to cast properties to other types.

I don't think it's possible to break apart the changes in any meaningful way.

But I think there are a couple of things that could be done to preserve source compatibility.

The changed code basically fall into three categories:

* Support classes (ex: ObservableListContentProvider)
* Property and observable classes
* Property object factory classes (ex BeanProperties)

It should be almost only the property factory classes that causes problems. Because when a return value type of a method is changed to get type parameters, then the callers get to deal with a non-raw type, without opting into this by adding type parameters.

This is what happens in the example code that you showed, Lars.

So, one solution if we want to do this without causing any compile errors whatsoever for clients is this:

Leave all the property factory classes as they are, without adding any type parameters. And deprecate them.

Instead we add new versions of the factory classes which have type parameters on their return values. These new classes look exactly like the updated factory classes in this change. These new factory classes can have the same names as the old once, but be located in new packages.

For example: 

org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans.typed.BeanProperties

We do this for all the following classes:
BeanProperties
PojoProperties
WidgetProperties
ViewerProperties 

This is the only why I can think of to avoid compile errors.

This solution was discussed briefly in the comments on the bug report.

Sounds great, Jens. Could you update the Gerrit to introduce the new factories? To check for source compability, maybe you you could break done the change into two, one for the framework, one for the examples and tests?

This could be an option. I'm not sure if we should introduce other almost empty packages. For WidgetProperties, for example, the package is org.eclipse.jface.databinding.swt. A package 'org.eclipse.jface.databinding.swt.typed' with one class does not make sense to me.

For interface extensions and sometimes classes the suffix "2" is used. So adding this suffix for the typed equivalents might be a better option.

I would prefer another package compared to the *2 approach.

Will do.

I've previously considered the suffix `Typed` on the class name: `WidgetPropertiesTyped`.

I agree that it is a bit weird to have packages with only a single class in them. But I think that is the least weird option. I think it is more weird for clients to have to used a weird name such as `WidgetProperties2` over and over in their code.

I think this case is different from the case with interface extensions:

* The factory class names are used so often in client code so a weird name becomes more annoying.
* The new typed factory classes are not extension, which makes a subscript feel weird to me.
