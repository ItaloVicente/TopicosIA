DESCRIPTION:

Bug 567905 - [JFace] ActionContributionItem violates IAction API
contract for images

Currently ActionContributionItem uses the hover-image as default image
and ignores the default image then. This also leads to the situation
that there is no hover effect at all.
There is also an USE_COLOR_ICONS mode where hover effect is used, but
also in an inconsistent manner where it can happen that even though
USE_COLOR_ICONS=false still color images are shown.

This commit
- unifies the handling of images between the two modes
USE_COLOR_ICONS=true/false
- always use the default image if given as such
- always use the hover image if given for the hover effect

> The attached snippet made the case much clearer to reproduce, thanks for that. It would be great to have that snippet added as part of the change. I expect this to be added to org.eclipse.jface.tests. 

I'll try to add this as a test as recommended.

> I observed that if USE_COLOR_ICONS is false that the hover image is still colored, while the default image is grayscale then. I would expect that the hover image is grayscale then, too.

The idea seems to be that the toolbar is gray by default and only the hovered item is colorful but I have never heard/used that feature before so I can only guess from the original code+comments.

> I agree with Andrey that the commit message should be reworked. 

In the meanwhile I tried to adjust the commit message let me know if further improvements are desirable.
