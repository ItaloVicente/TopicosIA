DESCRIPTION:

Bug 567905 - [JFace] ActionContributionItem violates IAction API
contract for images

Currently ActionContributionItem uses the hover-image as default image
and ignores the default image then. This also leads to the situation
that there is no hover effect at all.
There is also an USE_COLOR_ICONS mode where hover effect is used, but
also in an inconsistent manner where it can happen that even though
USE_COLOR_ICONS=false still color images are shown.

This commit
- unifies the handling of images between the two modes
USE_COLOR_ICONS=true/false
- always use the default image if given as such
- use the hover image if given for the hover effect, in grayscale mode
use the default image as hover image if no hover image is given
- add a test to validate images are propagated from IAction to ToolItem
- add a test to check if images are gray in grayscale mode
- add a test to check that missing image is used in case of missing
default image
