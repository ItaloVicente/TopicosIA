Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I miss a meaningful description of the change: why the old code was bad, why the new one is better etc.

Beside documenting this for future maintainers, it simply makes the reviewers the life easier.

@Andrey thanks for reviewing, I have tried to describe this in the bugzilla ticket, is anything unclear there?

To summarize here:
- old code uses hover image not for hover
- old code does not ensure gray-scale toolbar items are gray even though static setter suggest this
- new code fixes this by merging the two code-pathes (GRAY_TOOLBAR vs non GRAY_TOOLBAR) and ensures that hover images are used for hovering state if given

A little example that illustrates the problem, given the following code:

		Action actionTest = new Action("TestMe") {
		};
		actionTest.setImageDescriptor(ImageDescriptor.createFromURL(new URL("/tmp/red.png")));
		actionTest.setHoverImageDescriptor(ImageDescriptor.createFromURL(new URL("/tmp/blue.png")));
		ToolBarManager tbm = new ToolBarManager();
		tbm.add(actionTest);

What will happen is:
- The Action will get a blue icon
- There is no visible hover effect at all

---------------------
Second Example (using setUseColorIconsInToolbars=false (!))
ActionContributionItem.setUseColorIconsInToolbars(false);
		Action actionTest = new Action("TestMe") {
		};
		actionTest.setImageDescriptor(ImageDescriptor.createFromURL(new URL("/tmp/red.png")));
		actionTest.setHoverImageDescriptor(ImageDescriptor.createFromURL(new URL("/tmp/blue.png")));
		ToolBarManager tbm = new ToolBarManager();
		tbm.add(actionTest);

What will happen is:
- The Action will get a red icon
- There is a blue hover effect

So there are probably gazillions of clients relying on that behavior.

I wonder what existing clients would need to do to make their code working with the new change. Is this change backwards compatible?

Regarding the commit message.

A bug may have multiple comments, most probably unrelated to the commit itself, and also there could be multiple commits for one bug. The gerrit is good, but for describing the process to get the final solution, not the final solution itself. 

The git commit message (and git database) is the right and most convenient source for describing the particular change. So please independently to bug description on bugzilla or here in gerrit comments, simply provide a reasonable commit message. That message will be forever in git history and git blame/history would help further maintainers to understand why this particular commit did that thing.

See also https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform/How_to_Contribute#Commit_Message_Conventions

Unfortunately, Nick with commit ea21b4a1f4b404a99ae3649ebdb878edfe6d06cf did not provided neither bug id nor meaningful explanation why he changed the code and how the "USE_COLOR_ICONS" case is supposed to work for ToolItems. So we are here and guessing that now. BTW, I see the history of this particular piece of code contains multiple changes - so you probably want to do some software archaeology to understand the current state before proposing a final solution.

And probably this feature was never used because it is broken ;-)

Yes we can only do guesses here, but from an API point of view the current implementation and any client relying on this behavior is plainly broken.

IAction.setHoverImageDescriptor(ImageDescriptor) javadoc states:
> Hover images will be used on platforms that support changing the image when the user hovers over the item.'

IAction.setImageDescriptor(ImageDescriptor) javadoc states:
> Sets the image for this action

There is no indication nor any hint that the descriptor is ignored (despite if the platform does not support hover images or images at all) or one overrides the other.

For existing code there are the following cases:
1) no hover image is used and thus nothing will change, I suspect this to be the 95% case as I literally never has seen any eclipse-plugin using hover images
2) There might be cases where a hover image is set but no "real" image, also here nothing would change
3) both images where set but one is never displayed
4) One might have enabled "NO COLORS" mode that was ignored (or case 2 applies here) and it will now be taken into account.

Any suggestion is welcome, the current state just makes it hard to write any modern looking UI as not the hover effect itself is missing but even the wrong icon (from the point of the programmer) is displayed.

Christoph, such discussion belongs to the bug, so people that listening to platform UI bugs can participate. On Gerrit we discuss concrete implementation details of the patch.

My proposal would be to: (comment on bug please): 

1) Explain on the bug how the current state works, how it evolved, what are benefits/drawbacks of the current state.
2) Explain how the proposed change would work, how it should be better / faster / whatever.
3) Provide clear explanation what incompatibilities may appear with the new implementation and what is the proposed way to deal with them.
4) Check existing clients for an idea of how many and how would be affected. We have enough clients in SDK itself, but also one could check if CDT/EMF etc could be affected (I've just arbitrary used two well known open source projects that may contribute some buttons).

ActionContributionItem is a very basic thing, changing anything here may affect a lot of existing clients, so just saying the new implementation would do the "right" thing is not enough. We must make sure the "right" thing doesn't kill existing clients relying on old "bad" implementation.

The patch does fix that the hover image is shown on hovering and does not hide the default image.

The attached snippet made the case much clearer to reproduce, thanks for that. It would be great to have that snippet added as part of the change. I expect this to be added to org.eclipse.jface.tests. However, it is a manual test and all tests in the test bundle are currently unit tests. I propose to follow the approach from org.eclipse.swt.tests and add a source folder "ManualTests", in there a package 'org.eclipse.jface.tests.manual' and use class name "Bug567905_ToolItem_hover_image". In the test class I think adding some documented flags at the beginning could be helpful that trigger the different test options (value for setUseColorIconsInToolbars, use default/hover image yes/no).

I observed that if USE_COLOR_ICONS is false that the hover image is still colored, while the default image is grayscale then. I would expect that the hover image is grayscale then, too.

I agree with Andrey that the commit message should be reworked. "strange behavior" is not a good header, better describe what changes / what is fixed. I'd expect also some more information about the change in the message body. You have described quite precise here in the change comments and in the bug ticket your reasoning. Part of that I'd expect in the commit message body.
