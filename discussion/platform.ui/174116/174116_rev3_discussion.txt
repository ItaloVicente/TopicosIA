Thanks, Cristoph. I think this will be useful.

I made some minor comments.

A pattern that I frequently use is, submitting something outside the UI thread with a callback to the ui thread.

For example: fetch a list of data outside the UI thread, then update the ui as soon as it is done.

Something like
 
Callable readData;
Callable updateTree;
UISync.background(readData).then(updateTree)
Line:78, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Why do we need this method?

Line:161, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> typo "in the a"

Line:163, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Is the result of the callable only returned if called outside the UI thread (..,otherwise..)?

Line:51, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/swt/DisplayUISynchronize.java -> Why is this protected?

Line:22, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/application/BogusUISynchronize.java -> Bogus? 😂 Isn't there a more accepted term for this? Like mock?

I'll add a helper method for this, even though depending on the trigger this can already be done with this change.

For example if you are in a handler, you can use UISync.busyCall + simply do your update afterwards.
If your outside the ui, you can simply compute the value and use UISync.syncExec
Line:78, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> This is used in conjunction with showBusyWhile, because there the UI Thread is blocked, to keep the UI running/responsive we need to handle the events ourself.

Line:163, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> The result is always returned, but the busy indicator is only shown if called from an UI thread. This most commonly is usefull for eventhandlers, e.g if one clicks on a button that loads an image that is afterwards displayed on a label:
 Button btn = ...;
 btn.addSelectionListener(
     Image img = sync.busyCall(()->loadImage("..."));
     btn.setImage(img)
 );

Line:51, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/swt/DisplayUISynchronize.java -> The user should use the high level methods busyCall/busyExec because the contract of showBusyWhile is rather strange/low-level as it requires the caller of the runnable to keep the UI-Events running.

Line:22, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/application/BogusUISynchronize.java -> You probably know https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort 😄
I think these are just used to have something in the context without any use but I should probably try if we can simply use the Display Implementation here instead.
