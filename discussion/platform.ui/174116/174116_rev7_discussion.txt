Hi, Christoph, 

Maybe we should just do the callable methods first and skip the compute and busywhile methods.
Line:57, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> We break binary compatability with the new unimplemented methods

Line:87, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> action.run()

Line:107, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> For symmetry, call this syncExec(Callable) ?

For symmetry, also create asyncExec(Callable) which returns a Future ?

Line:177, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Are you sure you should be dispatching the event queue while in busywhile? I think we can get in trouble when we dispatch the event queue outside the main loop. See [1] for an incident in another part of the platform.

must the compute method show a busy indicator?

[1] https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=549166

Line:204, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Maybe skip this for now. It looks complicated. Should we not do a CompletableFuture here?

I think we can skip compute as its pure helper-method but why busywhile? The problem is that busywhile can't be emulated easily due to the design of the SWT-BusyIndicator.
Line:57, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> The class is marked as @noextend so it shouldn't be an issue as client extensions are forbidden.

Line:107, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> I don't think this makes sense, as this is for making sure the action either takes place in the Ui thread either direct or in a blocking manner what would be the usecase for a Future?

I often use this for example if I need the value from a textfield or combo.

Line:177, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> I'm not sure how the bug relates here? From the design of the busy indicator in SWT it is supposed that the user is responsible for dispatching events (just take a look at the Javadoc example for BusyIndicator) while the busy action is running (so for example repaint events can happen or asyncExec calls). This pattern is also used for example to implement (caller blocking) dialogs. Of course these actions are not designed to run "forever" so sooner or later the call will return to the original "main-loop".

> must the compute method show a busy indicator?

It helps to improve the user experience if the user knows that something is going on in the background (e.g. an action that is to short for a progress bar but to long to take place in the UI directly).

Line:204, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> I don't see how CompletableFuture can make this easier and the implementation is relative straight forward.

In general I don't like to provide a complete UI processing framework here but supply users with basic building blocks to maybe create more advanced frameworks on top.

Sure, makes sense.
Line:57, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Ack

Line:87, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Sorry if I was not clear. exec(action) will loop, I think you mean action.run() here.

Line:107, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Yes, you are right. Skip asyncExec(Callable)

Line:177, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Ack

Line:204, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Ack
