Not sure about the creation of the composite in the FillLayoutFactory.

Nonetheless thanks for accelerating the factory implementation a bit.
Line:162, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/layout/FillLayoutFactory.java -> Not sure about this?
From the name I had no clue what it does (also if it was newChildFor) and I needed some seconds to understand this. Then I was confused why a Composite should be created in a FillLayout.
Is this really needed by many users of FillLayoutFactory or do you want to cover a - maybe - special use case? Is it just a shortcut which you personally often need?

I think the creation of a new Composite with a new FillLayout is one of the normal uses case. For exmaple, if I look into org.eclipse.ui.workbench I see lots of new Composite... followed by a setLayout call.

Does it hurt to have this method in? Maybe you can think of a better name?

No, it does not hurt. But for me it feels weird. It does not belong to the FillLayout(Factory) to create a composite. Hypothetically one could imagine other objects than a Composite which can get a layout. Would you add methods for these other objects as well?

With regards to separation of concerns and single responsibility principle I do not like it. But I'd give it a +1 one if others like it.

I got convinced by Marcus! Will remove this. I think it is better to use this new factory in combination with CompositeFactory.

Example: CompositeFactory.newComposite(SWT.NONE)
				.supplyLayoutData(FillLayoutFactory.fillDefaults().margins(0, 10)::create).create(parentComposite);

Ah, sorry that would be wrong. supplyLayoutData only supplies the layout data. Should be also have a supplyLayout method?

There is a layout(Layout layout) method in AbstractCompositeFactory. Is that sufficient?

For layout we have to methods. The supplyLayout method should be used if the factory is used to create several objects. This method ensures unique layout data. What about the layout. Shall it be unique as well or can one create several composites and assign the same layout data?
In the javadoc of GridData it says, that it should be unique. But in FillLayout, GridLayout or even Layout I don't find such a note.

AFAIK it must be unique. But if we had a supplyLayout we could use for example GridDataFactory.fillDefaults()::create

Sure. Will you create a separate bug for adding supplyLayout. Though I'm not sure whether the same instance can be used or not. But it sounds weird anyway to use the same instance.
