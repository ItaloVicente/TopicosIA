DESCRIPTION:

Bug 543746: Project Explorer should show explanatory text

Use a stack layout to switch between the "original" composite and an
additional composite given the user explanatory text. This text is
displayed when no projects are in the workspace. Once projects are
created a resource change listener switches back to the "original"
composite.

The explanatory text contains links to:
- project creation wizards according to the current perspective
- the "New Project Wizard" to allow creation of any type of project
If no perspective specific project creation wizards are found then a
simple text with a link to the "New Project Wizard" is shown.

A perspective listener takes care of re-freshing these links.

OK, just smaller issues now.

From my POV, if they are fixed, we could merge.

Question: do we plan to update Package Explorer (I hope yes, once we merge this one), and would the current patch allow to do so (also I hope yes, but would be nice if you could verify it)?
Line:77, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/helpers/EmptyWorkspaceHelper.java -> typo?

Line:137, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/helpers/EmptyWorkspaceHelper.java -> I would sleep better if we would "null" the references to actions and parent controls, to avoid unintended memory leaks up to workbench if "badly" disposed clients still have an instance of us after disposal.

Line:227, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/helpers/EmptyWorkspaceHelper.java -> should check for null before adding. Sorry, have overlooked before.

Line:301, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/helpers/EmptyWorkspaceHelper.java -> We should use PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay() or the display of the control we have, later however could be dangerous if the control is disposed already.

I at lease have provided a patch for that. See: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/135629/
It's up to the JDT committers to accept it.
