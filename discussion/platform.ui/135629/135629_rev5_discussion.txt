DESCRIPTION:

Bug 543746: Project Explorer should show explanatory text

Use a stack layout to switch between the "original" composite and an
additional composite given the user explanatory text. This text is
displayed when no projects are in the workspace. Once projects are
created a resource change listener switches back to the "original"
composite.

The explanatory text contains links to:
- project creation wizards according to the current perspective
- the "New Project Wizard" to allow creation of any type of project
- the "Import Existing Projects Wizard"
A perspective listener takes care of re-freshing these links.

I did with patchset 5. I am not sure about the name and also not about the plugin have put it in. What's your opinion?

This is for patch set 4.

Good first version. Some comments:
- The Project Explorer has been added to support more than just Java, so, having a special link to create a Java project is not good, unless it can be configured.

- I would add a newline between the two sentences.

- I would replace "Select" with "Click".

- The Import dialog is not correctly positioned (compare with using File > Import...)

This is dynamic based on the perspective.

There is one.

In patchset 5 I already re-worked the text based on user-feedback. The previous text was a bit too wordy.

I will check this.

Good!

I meant another one ;-)

The link 'Create a general project' should be 'Create a new project' or 'Open the New Project wizard'.

Have an empty line between the sentences. That would be easier to read.
