Line:944, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/part/PageBookView.java -> I think PDEMultiPageContentOutline should return the empty selection, client code can assume it is not null. This is like the other ISelectionProviders do it.

Line:944, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/part/PageBookView.java -> This is a regression coming from the fix in org.eclipse.ui.part.PageBookView.showPageRec(PageRec).

The API of org.eclipse.jface.viewers.ISelectionProvider.getSelection() does not say anything about null returns, so while this is not common, we could have other selection providers with "null returns".

Docs usually state that they might return null. Right, this way it is safer. But would you also initialize PDEMultiPageContentOutline#selection to EMPTY, please?

Just for clarification: If we do not say in the Javadoc that a method can return null, than null is not a legal value and client are not allowed to return null. Only if the Javadoc specifies null as valid return type, we are allowed to return null

Sure. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/112862

Karsten, since allowing the NPE would be "breaking" change (we never checked the selection before), I would like to merge the fix in M4. Objections?

I think the additional guard is fine in general to protect from misbehaving clients but we should also fix the root cause in our code base.

The misbehaving client was fixed. If it is invalid to return null by contract, is this change obsolete?

Karsten, we fixed one single client. There are gazillions of them, and the change will affect all of "bad" ones which were unaware that the null is bad.

So we did both now, PDE fix is merged, but there are for sure others around returning null selections. Previous code ignored this, new one can't, but I strongly recommend NOT to break the "old" behavior of ignoring null selection and to integrate this patch.
