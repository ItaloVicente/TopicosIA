DESCRIPTION:

Bug 563695 - Cancel on the Appearance preference page shouldn't trigger
CSS engine

The theme selector combo box shouldn't change the current
theme until Apply is pressed. Same goes for the Colors and Fonts theme
combo.

Fixed this :) Good catch!

Found something new. Applying change of "Color and Font" does not work.

But that might give you the opportunity to fix another small inconsistency. I noticed that the Apply button triggers a 'please restart' message if theme was changed but the 'Apply & Close' button does not.
Line:262, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewsPreferencePage.java -> I second detail I didn't noticed before: the buttons 'apply' and 'apply & close' trigger different methods and for this page the 'apply & close' would not apply the "Colors and Fonts" value.

Line:329, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewsPreferencePage.java -> If we do not apply the 'color and font' immediate on combobox select I expect this to be false all the time. Overall it now compares currentTheme against currentTheme.

Thanks for the review Paul.

The differences between the Apply and Apply and Close button are fixed in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/163836/ (not yet merged or reviewed). I added you as a reviewer just to make it easier for you to find it, but don't feel pressured to give a review :)

With regards to your other comment, I'll look into it next week :)
