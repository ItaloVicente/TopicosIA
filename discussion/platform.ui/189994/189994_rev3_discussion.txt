I think all the code review items are addressed. Will this be merged ?

I'm still unsure about this change being really correct for your use-case, and thus creating the correct API. Imagine that some other view would allow to see your marker, what action would you like to see happening on open?
I believe maybe we need something more explicitly defined for the marker type, such as allowing to customize the open action for each marker through the org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerSupport extension point and make the view use that?

I do not see a problem in opening up an internal class. it's still internal and not public api, so we are still free to change.
one could even add a  
* @noimplement This interface is not intended to be implemented by clients.
to the class javadoc.

As long as it helps someone --- why not?

We just have one customized problem view that sees the marker.
If there are other views that need to see the marker they can also implement their own open action.
Using the extension point to define the open action would be a more complex change. 
I am not sure it would be needed, at least for our use case.

@Jorg: Unfortunately the type hierarchy makes that the public or protected methods on this class become API as they're exposed via MarkersSupportView.

That sounds broken by design. Still - there is prior art of protected calls methods like getUndoContext() and i do not see it would break anything - and i do not know any good alternative to offer the requested feature any other more suitable way.

Enda can you please add a unit (dummy) "test" that just overloads the method - just to make sure a future refactor will not make it package private again.

Can you recommend a good place to add the test case ? I notice there is a class MarkerSupportTests but it doesn't seem to be part of any suit and If I try to run as a junit plugin test the test cases fail. Maybe there is something specific needed in the launch config to run it.

since i cant see a org.eclipse.ui.ide.test maybe in the org.eclipse.ui.ide.application.test plugin
like UriSchemeHandlerPreferencePageTest
