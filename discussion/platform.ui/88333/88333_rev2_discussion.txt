The last part of the changed method tries to show error for a job. This should be avoided if workbench is not running I guess.

That's the general issue in this class (and other places).  In what sense is isWorkbenchRunning() being used as a guard?  To protect against bad behavior during startup and/or shutdown? 

Certainly without job cleanup, as corrected by this patch, it's not possible to use this ProgressManager correctly without leaks/problems in any Eclipse application that does not start a workbench.

If the guards are really testing for "isWorkbenchShuttingDown" or "isWorkbenchNotYetStarted", then it would be better in general to have methods that test specifically for that. Because if "isWorkbenchApplication" is false (no workbench is created, was created or ever will be created), then should the guarded functionality, whatever it may be, still be guarded to never happen?

Also problematic in general are any places (not just in this method) that use the workbench just to get "the" display but don't in any way otherwise depend on actual workbench APIs. Of course is super problematic to consider what the behavior should really be on a case-by-case basis.  One would want a test case and then the work gets even bigger...

Abandoned

The -1 Code Review has been pending for more than a year without any reaction to resolve it. That's a sign this got actually abandoned.
Please reopen if you're still willing to work on this patch.
