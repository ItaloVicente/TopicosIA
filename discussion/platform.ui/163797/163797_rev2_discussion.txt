Great patch Amit!

I can confirm that this fixes the issue on the dark and light theme, as well as my own custom theme.

Unfortunately, I am still unable to merge (or give +/- 2).

Should I contact someone about this?

Great to hear that. Eclipse is becoming much more polished and 4.17 will be awesome. I am happy that these 13 chars patch made a difference too.
