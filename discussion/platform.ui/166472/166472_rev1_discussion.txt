DESCRIPTION:

Bug 563755 - WIP optimize files to be shorter and faster

A 1 byte iso encoding is faster to parse and unicode is not needed in
this use case. Besides there is no need to format xml files at least
not using spaces instead of tabs.

Open question:
There are lots of mistakes in the files. Either the reference to
http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema is wrong or the schema/xml file.
Backwards compatibility is the holy grail so might have to find a
different solution that does not involve changing the schema files.

The 1-byte 8859-1 encoding is not necessarily faster to parse than UTF-8; in fact, if a document contains ASCII characters only (i.e. <127) then they are identical. However, fast-paths for UTF-8 exist in many places which won't (necessarily) be the case for 8859-1, so this change doesn't have any technical merit with regards to parsing speed. I do not recommend we change the declaration of the encoding without reproducible benchmarks to show any advantages.

Removing blank lines will make the files smaller, but if we're doing that, we should remove all whitespace between tags.

So you say the recommendation at https://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/faq-performance.html
Is wrong?
I removed only the whitespace the do not change the xml file content. We can remove the others too but it means that we really change the content.

It was written a long time ago and observations about performance then will have not necessarily kept up with the performance that there are now. We have explicit charset encoders/decoders natively for UTF-8, and it is the default for XML files, so that path is highly optimised now. Furthermore the encoding for UTF-8 into compressed strings is a well tested path.

> I removed only the whitespace the do not change the xml file content. We can remove the others too but it means that we really change the content.

The fact is: either you converted the XML files properly (and checked if there were any multi-byte UTF-8 encoded sequences where necessary) or you just changed the declaration at the top without checking. Either no changes were needed because there were no multi-byte UTF-8 encoded sequences found, or there were and we potentially just broke the XML file. If we didn't break the XML file, it's because we were only using characters under 127, in which case the UTF-8 and 8859-1 parsing speed is the same.

So either the encoding change has no effect, or it broke something without testing.

Regarding whitespace; removing the whitespace will allow (slightly) faster processing but will mean changes to the source files will have extra noise in them. If we had a means to post-process all the exsd files to remove whitespace at build time, that would be a better approach, because source control would still be 'prettified' but the generated/built content could be minified.

May i ask if there is any prove that utf-8 and plain 1 byte encodings parsing speed is the same or is that something that you suspect?
I agree that automating the cleanup process would be the best but I currently have no hope that this will happen soon.
Regarding whitespace removing I tried to remove whitespaces where there is imho no excuse for keeping it in. Some of the files have not being changed for a long time. I did not remove formatting what would save even more space. In a few cases I removed newlines between attributes which might not be acceptable for some.

I personally feel the question why there are many files with errors like „appInfo“ instead of „appinfo“ much more interesting. Obviously xmlspy and eclipse have a different idea what is valid xml.

Let me turn this another way around: is there any proof that ISO-8859-1 parsing speed is any different from UTF-8 parsing speed? After all, you're introducing the change, I'm merely defending the status quo. If you have data to suggest that it's faster, great - or is it something that you suspect?

Possibly not, but I think it might be worth a bug for enhancing the build of XML-like files which could introduce either an auto-tidy or auto-compress as applicable.

Sure, I'm happy enough with the whitespace changes, just not with the arbitrary redefinition of charset encoding.

Yes, XML is case sensitive so those places are almost certainly erroneous. It's probably worth separating out the 'fix broken xml' and the other whitespace/charset encodings though, so they can be reviewed and merged independently.

Hey Alex, you claim that the official documentation how to take care about xml performance is wrong - not me. But ok, I understand your point.

We have that already it is https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=563755

arbitrary is not the word I would use trying to be compliant with an official documentation.
Maybe it would be a good idea to document such deviation in the eclipse wiki. I mean you could be right and the next one will not know that this documentation is for whatever reasons invalid for eclipse.

There are not only such errors. There are a lot of others as well and I did not fix all of them.
So some of the files are still broken.

Well, it's official documentation for Xerces, rather than formally XML, but if you take a look at the Wayback machine that advice is exactly what was said in 2006. At best, the information is 14 years old at this point :)

https://web.archive.org/web/20061023113233/https://xerces.apache.org/xerces2-j/faq-performance.html

There have been many changes in the way that Java handles encodings since then. This was even before NIO/2 was added (and frankly, having been involved in XML/Xerces/Apache for a while, I think the advice was probably in place before NIO came out in Java 1.4.

Anyway, the point is - it's worth gathering data to determine what the current performance profiles are in modern JVMs and not rely on information on a web page that is well over a decade old.
