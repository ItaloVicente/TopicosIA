Looks better from OSGi perspective. 
My only concern is the exact place to do the switch between different approaches to listen for log changes. 
May be it should be done somewhere near Platform class? In other words what will happen with other clients of "static" log listening?

Line:190, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> This is bad since it only works if the service is there on creatin of part-control, but you will never know if its gone, updated or replaced.
A ServiceTracker with a customizer updating atomicReferences would be the right choice here

I understand the remark and from a plain OSGi perspective you are totally right. I personally think it is a quite big shot as in the IDE I neither think the LogReaderService is not available at any time and also does not come and go dynamically. But yes, considering to be a good OSGi citizen it makes sense.

I have pushed an update with the use of a ServiceTracker. But unfortunately it created a new change in Gerrit. Not sure why. I checked out the Gerrit branch and updated that.

Gerrit is a mess... you have always AMEND the previous commit or it fails to assotiate the patchset.
