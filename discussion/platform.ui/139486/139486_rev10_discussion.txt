DESCRIPTION:

Bug 545790 - Link handler for URI scheme cannot be added if
"eclipse.launcher" property is not set

* Move fallback for determining the eclipse launcher path from
  RegistryWriter to RegistrationWindows.
  This resolves the TODO in RegistryWriter. RegistryWriter now gets the
  launcher path passed in via the addScheme() method and does have to
  deal with the path determination itself. Path determination only
  happens in RegistrationWindows now.

* Change fallback determination code using eclipse.home.location
  property:
  - Simplify code by using URL instead of URI. URL is more relaxed and
    can handle the malformed URIs of eclipse.home.location better.
  - Remove fallback which searches parent directories of
    eclipse.home.location. This doesn't really make sense, as it is
    fragile and could pick up binaries that do not belong to eclipse
    at all.

* Add unit tests for the fallback scenario.
