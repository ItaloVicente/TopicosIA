DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573221 - ListSelectionDialog: Improve usability and extend its API

Improve the usability of org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.ListSelectionDialog
(which is used e.g. in the "Save Resources" dialog: see bug 572939) and
extend its API in the following ways:

(a) Enabling/Disabling of the "Select All" and the "Deselect All"
buttons
Actual: Both buttons are always enabled.
Expected:
- When all elements are selected, the "Select All" button should be
disabled, otherwise enabled.
- When no elements are selected, the "Deselect All" button should be
disabled, otherwise enabled.

(b) Shorten button labels: "Select All" => "All" and "Deselect All" =>
"None"
Shortening labels is a tradeoff between better readability (shorter and
more distinguishable) and that button labels should be verbs. The
shortening leads to the following new mnemonics:
- Alt+S for "Select All" => Alt+A for "All"
- Alt+D for "Deselect All" => Alt+N for "None"

(c) Extend API
The class is marked as "@noextend This class is not intended to be
subclassed by clients.", but internally, it is extended several times
for different purposes. The goal is that subclassing should no longer be
necessary for customizations, to achieve more consistency and avoid
duplicate code, and to give clients the same capabilities as the dialogs
used internally.
The extended API should provide following additional possibilities:
- Dialog title: to avoid that it will be missed, even the title can also
be set via setTitle()
- OK button label:
  - When nothing is selected: For example, "Launch without Saving"
  - When one or more elements are selected: With {0} as placeholder for
the current selected elements and with {1} for the total number of
elements; for example, "Save {0} of {1} and Launch"
- Whether the dialog can be canceled (via Cancel button or by closing
the dialog window)
- Whether to use SWT#SHEET (modal dialog that is attached to a parent
window)
- Optional checkbox:
  - Label
  - Default value
The existing constructor should be marked as deprecated in favor of the
new API.
