DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573221 - ListSelectionDialog: Improve usability and extend its API

Improve the usability of org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.ListSelectionDialog
(which is used e.g. in the "Save Resources" dialog: see bug 572939) and
extend its API in the following ways:

(a) Enabling/Disabling of the "Select All" and the "Deselect All"
buttons
Actual: Both buttons are always enabled.
Expected:
- When all elements are selected, the "Select All" button should be
disabled, otherwise enabled.
- When no elements are selected, the "Deselect All" button should be
disabled, otherwise enabled.

(b) Shorten button labels: "Select All" => "All" and "Deselect All" =>
"None"
Shortening labels is a tradeoff between better readability (shorter and
more distinguishable) and that button labels should be verbs. The
shortening leads to the following new mnemonics:
- Alt+S for "Select All" => Alt+A for "All"
- Alt+D for "Deselect All" => Alt+N for "None"

(c) Extend API
The class is marked as "@noextend This class is not intended to be
subclassed by clients.", but internally, it is extended several times
for different purposes. The goal is that subclassing should no longer be
necessary for customizations, to achieve more consistency and avoid
duplicate code, and to give clients the same capabilities as the dialogs
used internally.
The extended API should provide following additional possibilities:
- Dialog title: to avoid that it will be missed, even the title can also
be set via setTitle()
- OK button label:
  - When nothing is selected: For example, "Launch without Saving"
  - When one or more elements are selected: With {0} as placeholder for
the current selected elements and with {1} for the total number of
elements; for example, "Save {0} of {1} and Launch"
- Whether the dialog can be canceled (via Cancel button or by closing
the dialog window)
- Whether to use SWT#SHEET (modal dialog that is attached to a parent
window)
- Optional checkbox:
  - Label
  - Default value
The existing constructor should be marked as deprecated in favor of the
new API.

Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

Like the idea of improvement.

But I'm not sure about two things.
1. Do we really need to disable buttons like select all and deselect all. Haven't seen this elsewhere and if this should become a new pattern we maybe need to discuss it in a separate bug.
2. The shortening of the button labels. Also everywhere else the say "Select All" and "Deselect All". And if I'm new to the dialog it takes some seconds for me to understand what is meant by "All" instead of "Select all". Also I think some might wonder whether this means to "Save All" or to "Select All". Which is a huge difference with different consequences.

The button disablement improves usability by making it clearer what options you have, or more accurately, what option you don't have, so less to read and more feedback (when you hit the button, it becomes deactivated, indicating that the operation has been performed, and that pressing it more than one time does not make any sense). This pattern is a common pattern and should be used everywhere in Eclipse to improve usability.

I agree that shortening of "Select All" to "All" is a bit of a trade-off. What I don't like about "Select All" is that it introduces an indirection. For example, when used as a "Save Resources" dialog, the dialog should ask the user directly which resources to save, rather than asking the user to add the resources to save to a selection and then confirm the selection to save any resources contained within. As a nice side effect, Alt+A would become the shortcut to select all (which is similar to Strg+A), and Alt+S can then be used in the "Save Resources" dialog for the "Save" button (which is similar to Strg+S).

Whatever, what exactly needs to be done for this change to become acceptable?

I would suggest to keep "Select All" in this change and open a new bug to shorten the text so that we can handle these changes independently. I like the disablement so unless Marcus disagrees strongly, we can keep this in my opinion.

+2
I see two topics. Discuss the shortening on separate bug and also discuss the improvement for the save resources dialog. I also see a lot of improvement for this dialog but I'm afraid shortening labels does not solve the root cause. Would you please create these two bugs? thanks
