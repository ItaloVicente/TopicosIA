DESCRIPTION:

Bug 562801 - Cache parent node's hierarchy

Adds a cache based on WeakHashMap that maps a Node to its parent's
hierarchy. Several Nodes share the same parent, which results in equal
computation of the hierarchy. The cache's key is the parent node, if
any, which can be evicted when the nodes are dereferenced.

This change also includes a micro optimization of the initial size of
the 'styleDeclarations' list. This takes into account that the average
capacity of the resulting lists during styling with the dark theme was
measured with slightly less than 5. Since the lists are frequently
created and grow on first addition to 10, this will avoid a bit garbage.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The code looks legit. What i do not see: 
a) how to reproduce the "issue" (usecase)? 
b) is at really a speed improvement (measurement)?
c) how much memory does it need? - worth the time?

and
... at least the tests have to succeed!

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> a) When I wrote this I was debugging the CSS engine (with the dark theme).
b) Agree, this has to be measured. I won't come soon to this, so I likely should park the change locally and abandon it for now.

The test failures look unrelated. Would need to trigger another build to see if this is the case.

Abandoned

I have conserved the change and might put it to GH when the repo is migrated. But no time yet.
