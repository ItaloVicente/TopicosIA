DESCRIPTION:

Bug 562801 - Cache parent node's hierarchy

Adds a cache based on WeakHashMap that maps a Node to its parent's
hierarchy. Several Nodes share the same parent, which results in equal
computation of the hierarchy. The cache's key is the parent node, if
any, which can be evicted when the nodes are dereferenced.

This change also includes a micro optimization of the initial size of
the 'styleDeclarations' list. This takes into account that the average
capacity of the resulting lists during styling with the dark theme was
measured with slightly less than 5. Since the lists are frequently
created and grow on first addition to 10, this will avoid a bit garbage.
