@Lars: IIRC you were involved in this topic. Would you also be able to review this patch?

I'm a bit reluctant to give a + on this because the changes to StringMatcher are big and this class is used by other clients too.

At this point I would prefer to revert bug 203792 which worked just fine for at lesat the last 6 years.

@Dani: Are there some specific parts of this code which are making you reluctant and I could adapt to have this change less worrying to you, or this is the general idea you dislike?
About the real payload of the change, it's actually relatively small. Most of the diff comes from whitespace changes and method extracted/moved, but there are only a few lines that change some logic. And tests validate the former logic is not broken.

The change to StringMatcher is the problem and the fact that it is used by others.

Patch Set 7:

To be accurate, the StringMatcher behavior did change by M4 with bug 203792, in a breaking way. And this patch mostly restores the usual use-case back in its initial state while still enabling the feature of bug 203792.
So this change per se is less changing the behavior than what we've had for several monthes.

Not sure it's a sufficient justification to convince you it's okget this patch in, but at least I try ;)

Not at RC2. I could be convinced to revert the original fix though. Maybe Lars gives you the +.

Looks fine to me. Fixes the reported issue from the bug and the new unit test should also ensure stable behavior.
