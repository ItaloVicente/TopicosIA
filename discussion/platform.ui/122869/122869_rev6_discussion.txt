Looking for reviewers to have it in RC2.
As the code is fairly complex, I has to make a pass of refactoring before being able to identify the issue and fix this bug. Sorry for the many lines involved; but it's all internal.
Also, I did consolidate the testing of the PatternFilter with more cases to make sure we know better what's expected to be filtered and not. The existing tests were already good (although they're placed on a higher layer) and did spot some regressions with previous patches, which is a very good thing as it highlights that this feature is already decently covered on some other tests, increasing the trust you may place in this patch.

Line:39, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/misc/StringMatcher.java -> In order to reduce chances for late surprises I would keep this public. Esp. considering there are protected fields from this type.
