DESCRIPTION:

Bug 547754 - Slow loading "org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.css.theme" when using
shared drive as workspace directory

Currently we go through all the bundles for Css Theme contributions.
Instead it would be better if we get the contributions to the Extention
point "org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme" and get the plugins that these
contributions belong to and only search in these plugins for the theme
related information. This patch implements the above idea.

Pls add a test that verifies that all needed extensions are still loaded.

Besides the tests, what are the exact steps so that I can verify the performance improvement?

The way to test the patch is to use a shared network drive as the workspace location.

Steps to test the patch:
1) Create run Configuration with workspace location set as the shared network drive.
2) Run with this patch and without this patch.
You will observe the difference in the time taken for eclipse to launch.

Note : Network latency for the shared network drive affects the time for load directly.

Sounds great. Can you share your numbers? How much faster does the IDE start for you?

Please find the details below

(latency) 220 milliseconds ->  (load time) 215~220 seconds. (without patch)
(latency) 220 milliseconds ->  (load time) 60~65 seconds. (with patch)
(latency) 220 milliseconds ->  (load time) 55~60 seconds. (without patch and with '-cssTheme none' set)

Awesome. Looking forward to the merge of this patch

Line:1478, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/swt/PartRenderingEngine.java -> In some case, include extension for "org.eclipse.ui.theme" be required (so, my proposed code includes both ui.theme and ui.css.swt.theme).
"org.eclipse.ui.theme" provides color and font appearance preferences entry, which CSS may override. 

For example, "org.eclipse.wst.dtd.ui" plugin provides extension for "org.eclipse.ui.theme" to define color/font for some texts, but not provide extension for "org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme" itself, thus this logic ignores the "org.eclipse.wst.dtd.ui" plugin.
Then, if anyone create a theme extension plugin "separately" (e.g. "org.eclipse.wst.dtd.ui.themes") and create a css to overrides the color/font preference for "org.eclipse.wst.dtd.ui" plugin elements (e.g /org.eclipse.wst.dtd.ui/dtdKeyword preference value), this logic fails to pickup the preference of org.eclipse.wst.dtd.ui plugins.
