Agree with the removal (the squiggle is barely visible at all on my Mac, default light theme). How's it look on Windows?

But please do unrelated changes in separate commits.

The commit message should also be improved; this change doesn't remove _all_ custom drawing from PerspectiveSwitcher. Explaining in the commit message body what exactly is removed makes it easier to understand what's being done when just looking at a git log.
Line:528, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> This is an unrelated change? If so, please do that in a separate commit.

Line:538, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> Why the code duplication? Just call widgetSelected(e)?

Line:770, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/addons/perspectiveswitcher/PerspectiveSwitcher.java -> Maybe something to consider for a future change: why is this perspective switcher not just a simple toolbar? Why the custom drawing here with a custom gradient? I see it in your Linux screenshots, but I don't see it on my Mac at all and had never even noticed until now. Is there some semantics attached to this special background? What should it tell me as a user?

@Thomas see ticket for a hint how it look on Windows. The new screenshot might also answer your question why there was a custom gradient.

Thanks Thomas and everyone for the feedback.

The unrelated changes will vanish as soon as I rebase this patch. Currently looking into removing the other drawing operation.
