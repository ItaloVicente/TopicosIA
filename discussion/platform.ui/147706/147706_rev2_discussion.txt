DESCRIPTION:

Bug 549966 - Import wizard browses twice on directory field Enter key

When hitting enter in the Import Existing Projects wizards directory or
archive fields, the list of projects that are to be imported is
retrieved from that location. During this operation, the SWT page
control is disabled, leading to a focus lost event on the same directory
or archive field. This then triggers a second browsing of the directory
or archive.

This change ensures the focus lost event is ignored, while an Enter key
event is being processed. With this, the second traversal of the import
location is avoided.

I've put breakpoint at org.eclipse.ui.internal.wizards.datatransfer.WizardProjectsImportPage.updateProjectsList(String) and I see lot of calls to it during "ENTER" or just changing focus from "directory" to "archive" field and vice versa.

So for me this sounds still buggy.

Is work done twice though?

I think this code in "org.eclipse.ui.internal.wizards.datatransfer.WizardProjectsImportPage.updateProjectsList(String, boolean)" normally prevents this:

final File directory = new File(path);
if (path.equals(lastPath) && !forceUpdate) {
    // unchanged; lastPath is updated here and in the refresh
    return;
}

Only in the bug case (hit enter), there is nested execution in this method. So the line at which "lastPath" is set (at the end of the method) is not reached before the 2nd call is initiated.

See the 2nd stack traces from the description of: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=549966

I'm wondering why there is a focus lost handler at all. The list needs to be refreshed if the radiobutton selection changes or if the currently enabled text field input changes. Anyone with a good reason?

If not, just removing the focus lost handlers should fix the issue better than trying to manually filter some of the events.

If I type in the field, and it browses on changes, wouldn't this mean every letter triggers file browsing? I thought the focus lost listener is so that the browsing is done only after the user is done with their input.

My fault. I just looked at the smart import, when checking the behavior. You are of course right.

OK, Andrey found another problem, which is the same. Clicking on the radio buttons causes the same nested execution. Possibly on the browse button as well. Will check again.
