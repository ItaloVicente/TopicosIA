Thanks for the fix Christoph!

There are a few more implementations of IObservableCollection, other that AbstractObservableList and AbstractObservableSet. Those should also be fixed!

These are the ones that I found:

* DecoratingObservableCollection
* ObservableList
* ObservableSet

(There are also EmptyObservableList and EmptyObservableSet but inconsequentially none of those use getterCalled right now should those should be left out.)
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> The bug reference in the title is wrong. Please fix it!

Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> This fix is not about SideEffectFactory specifically, even if there's where the problem first manifested. So I think you should remove "SideEffectFactory" from the commit message.

Thanks for the hint, I'll update the patch to include the other implementations as well.
Just wondering: Is there any reason why ObservableList/Set does not extend AbstractObservableList/Set instead of AbstractObservable?

EmptyObservableList/Set seems to be sepcialized (singelton) classes that represent an empty and unmodified set that never changes so I think thats fine then.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> I'm not sure what this means, the Bug number if the one of the bugzilla bug or did you mean something different?

> Just wondering: Is there any reason why `ObservableList/Set` does not extend `AbstractObservableList/Set` instead of `AbstractObservable`?

No, I don't know. It seems weird to me too.

> EmptyObservableList/Set seems to be sepcialized (singelton) classes that represent an empty and unmodified set that never changes so I think thats fine then.

Ah, of course, you're right, I didn't think about that.

I think you have to increase the minor version number in MANIFEST.MF to 1.11.0 to fix the build problem.

An if you're feeling ambitious it would also be nice with tests for this in [Abstract]Observable(List|Set)Test!
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes, I mean the Bugzilla ticket. This position in the commit message should contain the Bugzilla ticket number.

When I check the Bugzilla for that ticket number I don't find any ticket:

About Bugzilla number: There is currently a bug so you can only see some bugs when you are logged in.

I'll see if I can add a test too.

I have checked this and ObservableSet/List are wrappers around another collection but don't allow modifications, I must confess that I find these semantics extremely confusing... anyways that means that whenever the underlying collection was modified one must call setStale but gettercalled is stil required.

Ah, you have to be logged in! Now I see the ticket. I didn't know that. Sorry!

Great!

@Jens: I have investigated a little further an wonder how much we can refactor these classes?

Current inconsitencies: 
- AbstractObservableSet is read-only by default while AbstractObservableList is read/write
- ObservableSet (what is an abstract class!) is read-only as-well and duplicates most of AbstractObservableSet instead of the constructor and the ElementType addition
- ObservableList (what is an abstract class!) is in contrast read-only and duplicates most of AbstractObservableList instead of the constructor and the ElementType addition
- AbstractObservableSet has a method getWrappedSet() and delegates to this, AbstractObservableList extends AbstractList and delegate to super-methods
- ObservableSet has a setWrappedSet but does not fire a change event, ObservableList has a updateWrappedList and does fire change events
- AbstractObservableList does currently not implement getSubList(int,int)

To make this more consistent and reduce maintainance-cost for future changes I would propose the following changes:

- there should be an AbstractCollection where AbstractObservableSet/List can inherit from most methods
- AbstractObservableSet/List simply delegates all calls to getWrappedSet/List() regardless for read/write (if someone need the read-only behaviour he simply can return an unmodifiable Collection)
- ObservableSet/List extends their abstract counterparts instead of duplicate all the code and do offer updateWrappedList/Set that does update and fire events, also both classes should become non abstract (they both don't declare any abstract methods...)

sadly this is not really back-ward compatible so would require a major increase, the good part would be that a major increase would allow to remove deprecated classes/methods also.

What I just forget: Theres are also DecoratingObservableCollection/List/Set that mostly behaves like modifiable ObservableList/Set but are modifiable and delegate ti underlying collections duplicating much of the code again.

And then there is WritableList/Set that also duplicates code from DecoratingObservableList/Set again but extends ObservableList/Set and not the abstract ones...

So to keep the semantics it might be that ObservableList/Set by default wraps the underlying collection into an unmodifiable version and WritableList/Set not, while DecoratingObservableCollection/List/Set becomes obsolete.

Hm... I agree that the design would be better if it were the way you describe.

But... My initial feeling is that it wouldn't be worth the cost of breaking backwards compatibility and doing a major version increase.

If you really feel that you would like to do this then please open a Bugzilla ticket for it and we can discuss more!

Okay I'll create some tickets about that topic and try to fix this issue in the existing code-duplication style :-)
