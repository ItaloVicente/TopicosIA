This change is ready for review.
Line:647, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> Rolf, I really have no clue what all this crazy code does starting with this line.
I see a lot of bugs around, like bug 388617 that introduced the if below but caused bug 416235 etc. 

I would appreciate if you could propose some minimal working draft with some explanation why all this dancing here is needed. Unfortunately we can't reproduce CCE yet, so I can't provide a steps to verify. 

Common on this bugs was perspective switch during debugging.

Andrey, I was already typing a message before I got yours. I noticed that it is still confusing.

I will try to free up some time and look into this. Cannot give any guarantees on time to delivery.
Line:647, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> I can understand the confusion. The PartServiceImpl as a whole seems overly complex with all kind of mixed responsibilities, on which many (partial) patches were introduced for all kind of corner cases. Not many test cases either. I think that I can draft a test-case that will trigger the CCE.

Line:661, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/PartServiceImpl.java -> Not exactly what I meant here, but I understand the confusion. 

What i tried to say was, that when there is not newActivePart, this case would be the same as the case on line 633. What I would do is switch the cases for when a newActivePart is found and when not. In case the active part is valid (this whole code block), then call activate(newActivePart, ...)
After that handle the case that newActivePart is not found, in that case have the code block from line 633 to 645.

However, calling activate(null, ...) in case of no active part might make sense in the 633-645 case too. Way too many corner cases here with only a few test in EPartServiceTest.
