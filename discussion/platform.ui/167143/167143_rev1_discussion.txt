Line:111, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/SashLayout.java -> This looks like a really nice solution. It's very similar to my own but also different in a few ways. My solution performs some basic state tracking and event filtering since I decided that the invisible sash should intercept the mouse events, and not allow them to propagate through.  I seem to recall a strong motivation to filter.

Line:121, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/SashLayout.java -> This is what my mouseFilter looked like:

public void mouseMoveFilter(Event e) {
	if(!host.isVisible()) {
		return;
	}

	Widget w = e.widget;
	if(!(w instanceof Control)) {
		return;
	}

	Control c = (Control) w;
	if(!draggingSashes && c.getShell() != host.getShell()) {
		return;
	}
		
	Point location = e.display.map(c, host, new Point(e.x, e.y));
	if(mouseMoved(location.x, location.y)) {
		//We are in on of 'our' regions, so filter out the event.
		e.type = SWT.None;
	}
}

I think the biggest difference is probably ensuring that the shells match in both the mouse down and the mouse move.  I noticed that if I opened dialogs, my filters were taking precedence.  

I also don't think I noticed any filtering going on in your patch, I worry with not filtering.  But I also worry with filtering in Platform.  In our product I determined that it was better to apply filtering to the events that were intercepted by the invisible sash, and I called it a part of doing business with the view.  I never really had any touch areas within 3px of the border anyways since it's usually padding of some sort.

Thanks for taking a look and sharing your thoughts, Mike! I've added a shell equality check as you suggested.

As far as the filtering is concerned, I must admit that I'm not fully across all the details. My naive approach is "let's listen to mouse events on all the display but not modify them, simply react to the ones that come near a sash", but I've got little SWT experience to strongly back my idea :)
