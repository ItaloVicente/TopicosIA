I just commented out the filtering in my solution to refresh my memory and I can say that it's better to have it than not to have it.  For example, on the right hand view, select the second tab, then try to resize the view by selecting the sash near the first tab... the first tab will become selected and it's not really the expected behavior.

Even worse than being selected, that first tab may even think you are trying to drag and drop it onto another view part.
