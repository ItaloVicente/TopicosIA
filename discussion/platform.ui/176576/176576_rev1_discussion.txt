DESCRIPTION:

Bug 571372 - WorkbenchPage#getActivePart() returns null for next
instance of E4 part

Use secondary identifiers for parts that are isAllowMultiple. Such that
different instances can be identified in the workbench, e.g. view
references are created correctly.

Note that this change is not heavily tested. I can imagine that it can cause regression, never know where the ID/secondary ID has impact.

Thanks for looking at this, Rolf.
Line:1100, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelServiceImpl.java -> Some thoughts: The lookup of such parts will now fail because of the changed Id, right? If so, it might break existing clients. An explicit tag could be introduced based on which this code is executed? 

Alternatively, we could require a key "secondary" with an int value to be available in the descriptor and being used as the secondary counter? This probably requires added logic to maintain it between instances, so that is unwanted.

The secondary id is a commonly used part, for instance the view reference was fixed in bug 401709 (line 1148 in WorkbenchPage, and findViewReference methods). Also in PartServiceImpl#createSharedPart the secondary id is considered.

I worry more about existing implementations that already provide the secondary id, will this not be broken here.

The secondary ID could also be provided as a second argument to the createPart method. I also thought about keeping track of the instances made from a descriptor, to see if a view is created already.
I have not looked how it is currently implemented for views in an extension point, i.e. when a view is added in an extension point it is also specified that multiple instances are may be used.
One place that I know that uses the secondary ID is the properties view, for each non-first instance the ID is set. See org.eclipse.ui.views.properties.NewPropertySheetHandler.findPropertySheet(ExecutionEvent, PropertyShowInContext)

This is some E3 code that we use to create secondary views. There is a showView method that has the secondary Id


 private static ResultsView bringToFront(final String viewID) {                                                             
   IWorkbenchWindow window = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getActiveWorkbenchWindow();                                        
	try {                                                                                                              
	  IWorkbenchPage page = window.getActivePage();                                                                  
	  ResultsView view = (ResultsView) page.findView(viewID);                                                    
	  if (view == null) {                                                                                        
		return (ResultsView) page.showView(viewID);                                                            
	  }   
          ...some other testing...                                                                                                       
          return (ResultsView) page.showView(viewID, SID + fCounter++, IWorkbenchPage.VIEW_ACTIVATE);                                                                                                                   
	} catch (PartInitException e) {...}

I like this idea.
