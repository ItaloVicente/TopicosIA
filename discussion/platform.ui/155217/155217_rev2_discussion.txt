DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 374568 - Part menu is not rendered correctly after removing
menu items

Attempt at adding support for removing items. Still many option issues.

Mayor problem is still how legacy items are reconciled. There should be
a one-to-one mapping between legacy items and model items, but this is
broken for SubContributionItems.

Rolf, what is the status here? Just stumpled over the comment:	// Bug 467000: Avoid repeatedly updating menu managers in MenuManagerRenderer which lead to this bug as one of the root issues.

The compatibility between E3 and E4 is seriously broken for Menus and Toolbars. The choice to directly use the E4 MenuManager in E3 results in many inconsistencies which cannot be resolved in general.
e.g. consider the case where an E4 menuitem is not rendered (and thus also not in the MenuManager) and E3 adds an menuitem, this consists in a non-trival merge (if possible at all).

I have been trying to get a full compatibility layer in, but haven't had much time to work on it lately. It does require a few weeks of full time effort.
w.r.t. other bugs, we might need to re-consider the dependencies and consider other workaround, as this one will take some time.
