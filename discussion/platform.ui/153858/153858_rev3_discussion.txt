Line:729, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/AbstractTreeViewer.java -> 1. This comment should be on the method below, line 749.

2. Missing <p></p> tags.

Line:1605, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/AbstractTreeViewer.java -> Lars, my point was that this method does NOT do this. This comment is misleading. Misleading comments are worse than no comment at all since someone looking at the code in the future can never be sure whether the comment or the code is wrong.

If you must, you could add something here to say that this method is called by the framework with redraws turned off if collapseToLevel() has not been overridden. But if it has been overridden, then we don't even know that.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1605, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/AbstractTreeViewer.java -> Make sense. Initially I was also surprised to find this comment here but decided to "keep the old documentation" logic. Thank you for reminding me that this is not how we should develop.

Thanks again Thomas, your feedback is highly appreciated.
