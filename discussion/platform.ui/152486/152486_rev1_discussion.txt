DESCRIPTION:

Bug 552714 - limit computed resource elements

Only return resources that begin with the given query to avoid long
sorting times in non-trivial workspaces.

Also filter out derived resources and switch to IResourceProxyVisitor
for better performance.

With this limitation the open resource computer is reasonably fast on my workspace, even for common files like manifest.mf.

The startsWith filter is obviously less powerful than the quick access matcher, but I don't how that can be improved without an API change.

I think we need to refine the condition to include (ie treat query as a regexp), and it would be a good improvement.
However, I'm still curious: isn't there a way to directly query the underlying resource index instead of crawling the tree?
Line:52, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/OpenResourceQuickAccessComputer.java -> I don't think this fit, as the query can have wildcards.

Line:54, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/OpenResourceQuickAccessComputer.java -> Isn't the ResourceElement type missing?

That's what IResourceProxyVisitor does, it's surprisingly fast - open resource dialog has more or less the same implementation.

How about using the same SearchPattern as in open resource for consistency?

Line:52, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/OpenResourceQuickAccessComputer.java -> Something like org.eclipse.text.quicksearch.internal.core.QuickTextQuery.createMatcher(String, boolean) ?

I don't see "query" used anywhere else, or I can't find it.
There is also org.eclipse.ui.internal.quickaccess.QuickAccessMatcher that seem to be used *after* elements are computed

That'd be great, if package structure allow it.

I've tried org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.SearchPattern. The matching is nice... but it's slow again. Still better than before, but queries like "resu*" take ~2s.

I guess we need to make a performance/quality trade off here. For full-featured matching there is always open resource, but quick access needs to be quick - even though we renamed it ;)

There's obviously something weird going on, as the computer limits itself to a 200ms timeout. Some more debugging shows that it's invoked 21 times with the same query.
