I had a quick look, but there is at least one possible issue I see in the code.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Revert-Revert, doesn't make sense

Consider pushing this as bug fix for Bug 440030, and marking 546777 as a duplicate

Line:368, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> I am not sure that references between between model references are handled correctly here. Pretty sure that this code can result in dangling references in the model fragments.

Maybe you could add a testcase for that?

Line:368, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> I assume you mean "cross references between model elements"!?

And I agree, this case is not handled, good catch.

A concrete use case would be, if the fragment contains a command and a handler and the handler references the command. Now if:
the command is marked with "noexist" and already merged
the handler is marked with always

=> we need to make sure, that the handler after merging is referencing the command which was already merged. Similar things are happening while merging related to resolving imports. @Stefan: could you add test cases for this?

Yes, but as Rolf pointed out, there might be other elements within the same fragment, which have a reference to the element you remove from the fragment, e.g. the handler having reference to the command in the example I mentioned above

The apply policy is for the entire fragment, not just for single UI elements. So if I remove an element only because it is already in the model. If I added a new Handler to the fragment referencing an existing command will not lose its ref. 
Or do I miss something here?

@Jonas Could you add two fragment.xmi files to the issue. the first one simulating the stored model, and the second the fragment that is merges only if notexists?

We have to look at EMF semantics here. I assume that the fragment is validated and all EMF-references are resolved. By just removing the elements from the fragment, all references to this element or any child of the element remains in tact. That is, there is a reference from the model fragment to the now removed element. This reference must be re-routed to the application for the remaining fragment to be applied correctly, and to result in a valid application model.

I don't think that removing the element with EMF helper classes (EcoreUtil) will result in valid behavior, only the element will be removed more thoroughly.

What would be possible is to replace all references to the removed elements with EMF Proxies. A call to resolve-all would then ensure that the merged in elements point to the already existing model elements. 
Something similar is accomplished by the 'import' statements in a model fragment. So it might also be possible to replace the removed elements by import elements.

I attached a manual test case (haven't tried it with your fix though), which simulates the case discussed above. Would be good to turn this into an automated test case. Pleae let me know, if this helps!

Revert of revert that stays for years without attention is smth not worth investigating even.
