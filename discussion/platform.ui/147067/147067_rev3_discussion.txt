Line:26, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/commands/CommandsTestSuite.java -> I would add comment *why* do we disable tests ("disabled on transition to Eclipse 4.x" or something similar), and move all the disabled tests to the end

Line:26, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/commands/CommandsTestSuite.java -> The tests were disabled in this commit:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/plugins/gitiles/platform/eclipse.platform.ui/+/328d2f9ad8a06f4c7519c305ae43d008e7c628a0%5E%21/

To be honest I don't understand the reasoning behind that commit. It says "enable more tests", but actually comments out tests.

Maybe the tests were already broken at that time? (a different test suite was linked in the XML)

So I did not want to put an unfounded reason in a comment here.

Seeing "transition to 4.x" here would actually confuse me.

How about a generic "// Currently broken / needs fixing"?

Line:26, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/commands/CommandsTestSuite.java -> The "full" UI tests were disabled after 3.x to 4.x transition (e4), only subset (ApiTestSuite) was running. In order to "enable more tests" Paul moved test execution from ApiTestSuite to UiTestSuite and commented out tests in UiTestSuite that were still failing.

So what we fight with is the debt left from e4 transition.

Therefore comment can say that tests were disabled during e4 transition and need to be adopted to pass with the new e4 API/ behavior.
