DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 543609 - Call saveState when a view closes

See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=543609#c2

Note that I needed to modify WorkingSetTest to make
testDeletedAndRecreated and testMissingProjectsInWorkingSet pass again.
They contained seemingly needless calls to DisplayHelper.runEventLoop,
which allowed the asyncExec lambda scheduled
in WorkingSetActionProvider.restoreState to execute. This messed up the
viewer input. The primary cause for the test failures was the
implicit assumption that saveState will not be called on the tested
navigator view. This assumption was wrong anyway because of the
workbench auto-save job, but calling saveState when the view is closed
in NavigatorTestBase.tearDown() made the tests fail predictably.

I'm still not sure whether we should call saveState when a view closes (as the updated patch does), or go another route and ensure that init(IViewState, IMemento) is called with a non-null memento only on restoration of an open view from the previous session. Either way, there is a risk of breaking existing clients. I'm sorry to say that, given the amount of time I have invested in it, but yet another way might be just to preserve the status quo...
