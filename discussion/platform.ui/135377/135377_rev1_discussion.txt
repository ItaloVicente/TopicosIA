Vladimir, can you please add a test for it? Some dummy part should be opened and closed. increment some counter, persist it on close and read back in the test, validate the counter is incremented.

Andrey, I'm currently looking at how things are done in the existing test suite to find a way to integrate the new test; it will take some time, as I'm completely new to this project. Meanwhile, we already have at least one failing test: IEditorPartTest.testOpenAndCloseWithNoMemento, which explicitly checks that saveState is *not* called on part close. I wonder, why? And what to do with that?

The name of the test insinuates with "no momento". Are there situations possible when there is no memento available? This would mean a situation where there is no backing store.

Yes, sometimes saveState may not be called on the editor (see the cases in EditorReference.getEditorState() where null is returned). But in this case, it seems just that before the patch, saveState was never called on part close and now it is called. I can see no other difference. Honestly, I don't quite understand what that test attempts to accomplish.
