I wonder whether persisting the *editor* state on part close makes much sense at all, since the workbench does not call restoreState(IMemento) when an editor with the same input and id as the closed one is (re)opened, as the failing test Bug543609Test.testEditorWithState demonstrates.

It seems that the workbench already provides the necessary API (IWorkbenchPage.getEditorState(..)/openEditors(.., IMemento[], ..)) if one needs to restore the editor state "manually", and an "automatic" approach that works fine for views just does not make sense for editors.

Perhaps the patch should be restricted to views only; i.e., call saveState on view close, but not on editor close. Of course, that would create an asymmetry of another kind...

Please check the bug linked to the test. I believe it was about saving cursor position.

Andrey, a failing test that I have just written (please see Bug543609Test.testEditorWithState in the updated patch set) questions the whole purpose of automatically saving state on editor close, as noted above. If we restrict the "save on close" behavior to views only, IEditorPartTest.testOpenAndCloseWithNoMemento will pass again.

Is the workbench calling the savestate in editors on save intervals?

Yes, and it makes sense; provided that an "auto-saved" editor is not closed by the user in the current session, its state will be restored upon workbench restart, even if a crash occurs. A closed editor cannot be restored.
