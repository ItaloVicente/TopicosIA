DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 543609 - Call saveState when a view closes

See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=543609#c2

Note that I needed to modify WorkingSetTest to make
testDeletedAndRecreated and testMissingProjectsInWorkingSet pass again.
They contained seemingly needless calls to DisplayHelper.runEventLoop,
which allowed the asyncExec lambda scheduled
in WorkingSetActionProvider.restoreState to execute. This messed up the
viewer input. The primary cause for the test failures was the
implicit assumption that saveState will not be called on the tested
navigator view. This assumption was wrong anyway because of the
workbench auto-save job, but calling saveState when the view is closed
in NavigatorTestBase.tearDown() made the tests fail predictably.

Yes. I believe we are done. Please finalize the commit message.
