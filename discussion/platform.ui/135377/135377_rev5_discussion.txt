DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 543609 - Call saveState when a view closes

See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=543609#c2

Note that I needed to modify WorkingSetTest to make
testDeletedAndRecreated and testMissingProjectsInWorkingSet pass again.
They contained seemingly needless calls to DisplayHelper.runEventLoop,
which allowed the asyncExec lambda scheduled
in WorkingSetActionProvider.restoreState to execute. This messed up the
viewer input. The primary cause for the test failures was the
implicit assumption that saveState will not be called on the tested
navigator view. This assumption was wrong anyway because of the
workbench auto-save job, but calling saveState when the view is closed
in NavigatorTestBase.tearDown() made the tests fail predictably.

Thanks Wim! This is just another attempt at a green build. Silly me. I wondered why API Tools did not catch it initially, but then realised that I had Eclipse SDK 4.10 set as API baseline, which, of course, did not include test bundles.

Sounds good. Few commit message issues.
File Comment: /COMMIT_MSG -> Please give an explanation for the main change. Most of the commit message right now is only about the test fix, which is not the main change.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please remove this prefix

Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> The bug is referenced above already.

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> Better just say: 

Modified WorkingSetTest ...

Now the change is only for CompatibilityPart. What about e4 pure parts?

Andrey, thanks for your comments! Unfortunately, this is still WIP and is not intended to be merged at this point.

I think a better understanding is needed of what exactly needs to be done in this area. There are basically three ways how to deal with the current situation regarding view state management, and this patch is just exploring the first one. Risking to repeat myself, I'm still not sure whether we should call saveState when a view closes (as the updated patch does), or go another route and ensure that init(IViewState, IMemento) is called with a non-null memento only on restoration of an open view from the previous session. Either way, there is a risk of breaking existing clients. And yet another way might be just to preserve the status quo.

Please see my comments on bug 543609 for more context. Thanks again!

Thinking about this, this could/should all be handled by @predestroy and friends right?

Wim, I'm afraid I know little about e4 pure parts to answer this question. Can they implement IViewPart? I have searched and found a class named E4PartWrapper, which extends ViewPart, but it does not override init or saveState.

Line:56, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ViewReference.java -> It had to be made public. But I don't think it is a new API. ViewReference is a class in an "internal" package.

I have searched for callers of IViewPart.init(IViewSite, IMemento) and found only ViewReference.initialize, which is called only from CompatibilityPart *or* WorkbenchPage.getWorkbenchPage(MPart). The latter returns either CompatibilityPart.getPart() or an E4PartWrapper, which, as noted above, does not override init or saveState.

Since this bug is about fixing the asymmetry in the workbench calling init/saveState, it thus seems that all the relevant cases have been covered, if I understand it correctly.
