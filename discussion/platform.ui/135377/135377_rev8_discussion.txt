DESCRIPTION:

Bug 543609 - Call saveState when a view part closes

Fixed the asymmetry in the workbench calling IViewPart.init(IViewSite,
IMemento) when a view part opens, but not calling saveState(IMemento)
when the view part closes within the running workbench session.

Modified WorkingSetTest to make testDeletedAndRecreated and
testMissingProjectsInWorkingSet pass again. They contained seemingly
needless calls to DisplayHelper.runEventLoop, which allowed the
asyncExec lambda scheduled in WorkingSetActionProvider.restoreState to
execute. This messed up the viewer input. The primary cause for the test
failures was the implicit assumption that saveState will not be called
on the tested navigator view. This assumption was wrong anyway because
of the workbench auto-save job, but calling saveState when the view is
closed in NavigatorTestBase.tearDown() made the tests fail predictably.

Validimir, I don't get how @PersistState and workbench save work together. Can you explain?

When is @PersistState executed and why does the workbench save not use this mechanism?

Wim, as far as I can see, Workbench.persist() saves the state in a specific order: first, open editors; then, workbench state; last, open views. Probably, that's why Workbench.persist() explicitly calls EditorReference.persist() and ViewReference.persist() to update the saved state of the editors and views, rather than uses the @PersistState mechanism.

A method annotated with @PersistState is called whenever a part is disposed (it is called from PartRenderingEngine.safeRemoveGui), either when a part itself is closed or when the containing workbench window or the workbench is closed. When the workbench closes, Workbench.persist() has already been called before a @PersistState method is called. Hence, to avoid calling ViewReference.persist twice in the row, we check in CompatibilityView.persistState() that the workbench is not closing.

This breaks an important scenario. I added a test case for it to the bug report.
