As a professional pessimist I expect there exist a view out there which use those events to do some importent stuff required even if hidden. Making it opt-in would probably miss many views which can profit from this change but we might require some opt-out so a view can still receive events when hidden.

Apart from that I already read the bug report and think this can be a good improvement.

See, the failed test support my fear. :D

Now it's the question if those tested hidden updates which fail now are really necessary.

I agree, we must provide a way for views to opt-out or opt-in depending on the upcoming from other people. Wim, maybe we can use the application model for that and define new tags?

Android has this notion of a strict mode which you can turn on during development. This will crash the application if you are doing something stupid, e.g., network access from the main thread.

Maybe we could build in something like that to check for views which do updates in the background.

If you look at the code of the PropertiesView, the opt-out kind of exists. But every view must check if it not visible, and change behavior accordingly. Though for the PropertiesView listening to all selection events used to be very important. After my last change it might be less important. I will comment in the bug report

The idea to optimize is good in general, but there should be a way to turn this new check off. Otherwise our users may be very surprised by this optimization.

Moreover, it slightly violates the subscription contract: it is the responsibility of subscriber to filter out the event or/and to declare the filter during subscription.
