Not sure that this does what is expected to do, though I did not test the code.

As usual, if you can provide test cases that would be wonderful.
Line:145, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ControlContribution.java -> It is more common in code to let update() call update(null), instead of this way.

Line:326, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ToolBarManager.java -> Effectively this variable is not used

Line:338, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ToolBarManager.java -> Shouldn't you just call src.update() here? Maybe conditional (only when force?).

Line:373, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ToolBarManager.java -> At this point, all visible items from getItems should be in the clean list, does this code do anything?

Giving it some more thought, I really wonder what the control flow should be here. 
You have extended ControlContribution, that one changes size. Wouldn't it be most efficient that the ControlContribution calls parent.update(CHILD_SIZE_CHANGED) or something like that? That is you don't call update(force) on the menu manager, but your custom update() for the ControlContribution.

Then again, if you call update(force) this might need to trigger update of widget sizes on all contribution items as well.

Thanks Rolf for taking a deeper look, I must confess I found the code confusing here with all the index stuff and at first tried to find a minimal change that solves my isse, but Sebastian then mention (what is right IMO) that the problem should be solved more generic for other contributions as well, so I'm tried to solve it in a more generic way.

If you have idea to solve this in an even better way thats fine, the main problem I see here is that in most cases it is not possible for an element to know it must change size, as SWT/JFace does not offer a mechanism as Swing where a model can post changes to the attached UI-Elements in a straight way.

So the obvious way for me was, that when the underlying model changes, I call the update(force) on the Toolbarmanager to reflect the changes, so I don'T need to find out what individual elemnt needs to be updated.

I'll try to fix the issues you mentioned and will check if there is a test for ToolbarManager I can extend with this one.
Line:145, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ControlContribution.java -> I checked the javadoc of that method and it is not clear about if it is legal to call update(null)
