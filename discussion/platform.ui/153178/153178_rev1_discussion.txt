DESCRIPTION:

Bug 553353 - Project Explorer hides contributed projects (EmptyWorkspaceHelper)

This commit separates the detection of emptiness from all the code that
updates the UI accordingly. For the ProjectExplorer it implements an
EmptinessDetector that uses the logical model of the actually
contributed NavigatorContentExtensions. For the ResourceNavigator it
implements a WorkspaceEmptinessDetector that uses the same logic as
before.

I had to change the order of some calls, namely the ones to
registerListeners() and to switchTopControl(). I've added respective
source code comments to explain the background.

I must admit that my solution is a little less than ideal because it
creates a subclass of CommonViewer in order to override the methods
refresh(), add(), and remove(). This is currently needed because I
couldn't find any events in SWT, JFace, or CNF, that I could listen for
to be notified about model changes. I believe such events do not exist,
but I stand corrected.

I carefully tested that all possible combinations of virtual projects
and physical workspace projects work correctly in both the
ProjectExplorer and the ResourceNavigator,  after additions, after
removals, and after restarts.

I think it would be great if we can keep it all on the UI level (without strategies to deal with different models), as suggested in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/153169/ .
However, as mentioned in your comment, there doesn't seem to be an event to listen for addition of a TreeItem. So maybe we should request it to SWT ?

I think that would be useful in quite a few scenarios. Have you thought about VIRTUAL viewers? Not sure if that is possible with CNF; the Project Explorer isn't VIRTUAL, is it?

I've sent a mail to platform-dev@eclipse.org asking for more help.
I've tried hacking with the VIRTUAL and SetData stuff, unsuccessfully so far. Maybe I didn't use it correctly, but it seems to me SetData isn't sent for root elements in a VIRTUAL tree (because the root ones always need to be already resolved).

As mentioned in other discussion, I think this should instead be relying on the actual Tree widget state, maybe even made a JFace EmptyTreeHelper utility that could be leveraged in many places.

Abandoned

The -1 Code Review has been pending for more than a year without any reaction to resolve it. That's a sign this got actually abandoned.
Please reopen if you're still willing to work on this patch.
