DESCRIPTION:

Bug 558807 - Separate plugin org.eclipse.urischeme.win32

Move win32 implementation of URI scheme operating system registration
to separate plugin.

* Add new org.eclipse.urischeme.registration.impl package containing
  re-use code for implementations and consume it in win32 bundle.

* Make Scheme class visible in .impl package and re-use in tests.

* FileProviderMock was copied (necessary parts only) to new win32 test
  fragment. Re-use of existing implementation would require moving it
  to a 3rd separate plugin. Referencing the other test fragment is not
  a feasible option, because it would require a p2.inf and
  'Eclipse-ExtensibleAPI: true' in the host plugin, but that would then
  lead to a

    Project has only main sources but depends on project 'org.eclipse.tests.urischeme' which has only test sources.

  error in org.eclipse.urischeme.win32 (bug 541008). This is not worth
  the effort for saving ~100 lines of stub code.

What specifically does require to extract this code to a dedicated plugin? Wouldn't it be simpler to keep it in the current bundle and just "guard" the classloading against non-matching OS with a static initializer?

The idea is to only bundle the new JNA dependency in the win32 feature.

Therefore we need to extract the win32 urischeme consumer. Otherwise we would run into build failures, wouldn't we?

Is it really worth the effort (adding extension point, splitting bundles...) ? I have the impression that adding depedency on JNA for all OSs wouldn't be too bad and would make things much simpler.

I agree. I would be fine in adding it everywhere. I asked in the bug again for objections.

we'll keep all code in one bundle and simply require JNA everywhere
