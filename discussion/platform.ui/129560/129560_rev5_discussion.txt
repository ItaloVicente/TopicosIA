We are early 4.10 so we still can do this if we identify a scenario in which this makes sense. Even with this change, we call the enablement around 7-18 times.

The number of times you still call it is not important. The TIME when you call it is the thing that is most important. 

It might be that the 19 call would change the state, ... but anyhow go ahead

We cure here one of the sources. This patch will ensure that the runandtrack will not request the handler evaluation multiple times. I think your comment fits better to https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/129271/. If you really think this is not one of the sources, please explain.

This was the number of calls during a part switch. UI gets again active after this switch.

Lars, such kind of issues are very hard to trace down to *this* patch and impossible to the end user to verify if this is this regression.

However, if we can point to the property and ask - does your Eclipse work with "-Dbug_536308.disable.throttling", we will get immediate feedback.

Also from my experience the worst regressions are found usually too late :-)

So I still -1 on this patch without a property disabling it. If this patch survives 4.10, we can remove the property in 4.11.

This is a better explanation than "sleeping" better. I will add this property. 

Btw. Andrey, if we could reduce the number of calls to 1 I assume we will have the snappiest UI ever, CSS performance overhead will be nothing compared to this one. At the moment ALL enablement methods in our visible handlers are called ~20-30 times.
