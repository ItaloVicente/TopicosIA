DESCRIPTION:

Bug 553353 - EmptyWorkspaceHelper hides non-empty tree

Instead of checking projects, EmptyNavigatorTreeHelper now
checks for actual tree content to decide whether to override
it with an Empty*Helper or not.

Thanks Matthias for the review.
Did you test it or only reviewed the code? If the former, on which OS (I'm not 100% confident listener on parent's Paint event works everywhere)?

I just tested on macOS with your change.

I found one problem with the "Package Explorer". It is empty on a workspace without any project. But it showed the "Useful links" before this change.

The cause the the rename-ing:

JDT requires an additional patch.
Did you have the opportunity to try the Project Explorer? If this works on all OSs, then we can consider adopting it and providing the patch for JDT then.

Even after changing back the renamed to file to "EmptyWorkspaceHelper" I get a NPE:

!ENTRY org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench 4 0 2019-11-26 14:27:19.324

java.lang.NullPointerException

	at org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.packageview.PackageExplorerPart.createPartControl(PackageExplorerPart.java:499)

Remark: I don't have the JDT project in my workspace. I only have the projects in my workspace which where affected by this change.

I just tested with both Project Explorer and "Navigator" open next to each other.
I then created a java project by press a link in the "Project Explorer". The "Project Explorer" is refeshed once the project is created. The "Navigator" is not refreshed. It is just refreshed once I click inside of this view. With the old implementation both views where updated automatically.

All tests performed on macOS

strangely: Deleting the last project in the workspace updates both views correctly.

Not so strange: there are events to listen to for removal of elements, but I didn't find anything suitable for addition, so the way it tries to detect creation of new elements is not so good...

Laurent suggested a workaround for detection of element creation: Have a thread or a job that monitors for tree content every second as soon as the tree is empty.

Sorry for the delay, I've been busy.
This issue is not in my personal priority and I don't plan to work on it anytime soom.
This patch can be interpreted as obsolete (although it does contain a part of the solution by looking at tree content instead of resources), and I think the best solution at the moment, until we have listeners on Tree to be notified of addition/deletion of visible root items, is to implement in the EmptyNavigatorTreeHelper a thread that monitors the tree content, as mentioned in my earlier comment.
So I'm abandoning it to clarify that.
