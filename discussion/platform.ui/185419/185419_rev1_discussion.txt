DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574639 - Avoid initialization of OS editors for compatibility.editor

OS Editor IDs get a magic prefix. Only IDs starting with the prefix will
be treated as external Editors.

Downside: upgrading old Eclipse Instances will lose the System Editor
associations.

I prefer to let Mickael and Andrey answer this. I personally do not care a lot about loosing this association during an update, as I rarely use System Editors.

I would prefer not to break existing workspaces. Compatibility breaks are always not nice, and should happen only if there is a good reason to do so.

The only thing we gain here is logging of possible issues - but so far (and from experience) there are no known issues with that concrete code, which is for decades there, and only reported errors were valid use cases. 

Since even a potential issue wouldn't cause much harm anyway, that doesn't justify a compatibility break for me.

So I would simply mute the log for non-debug use case:

no no, thats a missunderstanding. This patch prevents the unwanted unnecessary delay upon eclipse start due to wrong IDs. - while your patch only hides the warning about that.
Its a breaking change - yes. But its only once in the lifetime for this topic. 

And: finally this solves all problems around forever. (hoping eclipse will stand for longer) 
You could for example mislead eclipse by installing a "org.eclipse.pde.ui.manifestEditor" (or alike) app on your OS which could break eclipses internal editors.
