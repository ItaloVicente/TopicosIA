DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574639 - Avoid initialization of OS editors for compatibility.editor

OS Editor IDs get a magic prefix. Only IDs starting with the prefix will
be treated as external Editors.

Downside: upgrading old Eclipse Instances will lose the System Editor
associations.

Do we have a place where the old settings could be migrated? If yes, we could have something similar to:

		boolean migrated = PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getService(MApplication.class).getTags()
				.contains("externaleditormigrated"); //$NON-NLS-1$
		if (!migrated) {
			// TODO do migration
			PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getService(MApplication.class).getTags().add("externaleditormigrated"); //$NON-NLS-1$

		}

The getOSEditor method is not called for me at startup time. Is this change still about startup time? Bug 574639 says so.

As far as i understand it depends on which Editors you have left open.
When you restart Eclipse you normally start with the old Editors. If the editor is bad behaving you suffer from it at startup.

Yes, and that's why I think effort should be focused on finding out why would such editors be bad behaving, and why we'd store in the memento a bad editor. Working on the root issue is always more profitable.

I recently opened a svg file from Eclipse with an external editor (Inkscape) and since then Eclipse starts in slow motion mode (I would guess ~2x or 3x slower). I have to confirm that in a runtime Eclipse but if that is the case, we definitely should remove that from the startup code.
