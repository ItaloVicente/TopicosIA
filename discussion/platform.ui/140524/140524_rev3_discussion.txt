Patch Set 3: Code-Review+2

(1 comment)
Line:25, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding/pom.xml -> Please avoid changes regarding formatting, cleaning whitespace etc. since those make reviewing harder. if you feel those should be done for a good reason, then it is often helpful to split everything into 2 commits: one with functional changes, one with cleanup/whitespace/etc. changes, such that reviewers can have an intense review of the functional change and "just merge" the cleanup.

Be aware that sometimes files in the repository are not in sync with the formatter settings of the project, so even just editing a single line in a .java file may create hundreds of formatting changes due to auto-save. In that case you can hit Undo once after saving, and that will only undo the formatting changes, not your manual changes.

(and congrats to your first contribution, I read that on twitter, right?)

Thank you so much for the tips and the careful review. I didn't even notice the formatting changes. I will pay more attention next.

Yes, I shared it on twitter! Very excited to contribute. In fact, these changes are being made automatically by a tool that I'm working on. I hope to submit more changes that you folks find valuable.

If you are working on a tool for such changes, you may want to have a look at refaster: http://errorprone.info/docs/refaster

I've used it in private projects, but not in Eclipse projects.

Nice! I didn't know about refaster. I will surely look more into it, seems that it can do some transformations very easily. I'm guessing that it will complement what I currently have very nicely.

Thank you again! Very helpful.
