DESCRIPTION:

Bug 546820 - Mark deprecated observable factory classes for deletion

The observable factory classes have been obsolete since the databinding
framework was transitioned to work with property classes in 2014.

* This change marks those classes for deletion
* It also deprecates some classes that was overlooked in 2014
* Minor version of the affected bundles are updated
* API problem filters for the resulting build issues are added

It would be nice if these are accompanied by using the Java 9+ @Deprecated(forRemoval=true). This would require moving the bundle to Java 11 but this is fine for the September release.

Truth!? Nice! I'm going to put `var` everywhere! Databinding has a lot to win on `var` to avoid repeating the long types for observables and properties.

I will add `forRemoval` also.

Using var would be cool

Note that when bumping bree one has to bump the minor version too. Regarding var - please keep it for separate patch after this one :).

On a second though, I'd rather abstain from adding forRemoval to this change for now if that is okay.

There are so many steps to this removal process already and I'd rather not complicate it further with updated Java versions.

Fine with me. I'm just spreading the message that people can use new features :).
