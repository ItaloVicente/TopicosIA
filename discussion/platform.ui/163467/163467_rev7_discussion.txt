DESCRIPTION:

Bug 546820 - Mark deprecated observable factory classes for deletion

The observable factory classes have been obsolete since the databinding
framework was transitioned to work with property classes in 2014.

* This change marks those classes for deletion
* It also deprecates some classes that was overlooked in 2014
* Minor version of the affected bundles are updated
* API problem filters for the resulting build issues are added
