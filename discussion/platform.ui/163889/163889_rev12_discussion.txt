DESCRIPTION:

Bug 477391 - Provide a deferred way to create ImageDescriptors in JFace

Since a majority of images are not used at any one time, calculating the
URL necessary for the image is an expensive (in terms of I/O) operation.
By using a Supplier<URL> instead, we can defer the lookup of the image's
URL until the image data is actually requested (which should be when the
image is displayed on screen).

Code that uses ImageDescriptor.createFromURL(expensiveURL) can be
refactored into ImageDescripor.createFromURLSupplier(()->expensiveURL)
to see performance gains.

Since this is new API, only callers that have been updated to use the
new method will see the benefit.

Just two minor questions below before publishing this change.
Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/DeferredImageDescriptor.java -> Should it be final?

Line:50, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/DeferredImageDescriptor.java -> Should it be package-private?

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/DeferredImageDescriptor.java -> I was following the pattern of other image descriptors here, some of which aren't final. However, I don't see any harm in making it final, since I don't think there's much sense in allowing it to be subclassed.

Line:50, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/DeferredImageDescriptor.java -> Could be.

This one is good to go now; there were some other comments on one of the dependent changes which can be addressed later if needed.
