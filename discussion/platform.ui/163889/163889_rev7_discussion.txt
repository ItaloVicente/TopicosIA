DESCRIPTION:

Bug 477391 - Provide a deferred way to create ImageDescriptors in JFace

Since a majority of images are not used at any one time, calculating the
URL necessary for the image is an expensive (in terms of I/O) operation.
By using a Supplier<URL> instead, we can defer the lookup of the image's
URL until the image data is actually requested (which should be when the
image is displayed on screen).

Code that uses ImageDescriptor.createFromURL(expensiveURL) can be
refactored into ImageDescripor.createFromURLSupplier(()->expensiveURL)
to see performance gains.

Since this is new API, only callers that have been updated to use the
new method will see the benefit.

JFace has already been bumped up to 3.20 and hasn't yet been released. Do we need to do that again for this release cycle?
