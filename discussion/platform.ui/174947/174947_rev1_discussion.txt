DESCRIPTION:

Bug 570424 - Create JFace/SWT Factory to prevent resource leaks

WIP

This is a proposed class to manage "one-off" resource creation. With
"one-off" I mean a resource that does not need to be cached and can be
disposed when the accompanying control is disposed.

It will reduce a lot of boiler plate code, especially in the "graphics"
area like GC, Path, Region, etc.. But also anywhere else (see example)

Ideally this class should go into SWT but I am incubating it here and
maybe it stays here. IMO SWT is the best place because then the javadoc
of the various resources can point to this Factory.

If this is something we want I will add all constructors for all
resources, Image, Font, Path, Color, GC, etc..

Shouldn't this be in SWT itself?
Also SwtFactory, not just "Factory", and may be with Supplier<Resource>?

Line:33, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/Factory.java -> Name is way to vague, especially for an API proposal.
It also look like this would make more sense in SWT itself.
Overall I'm unsure this is worth the maintenance cost (adding an API is expensive on long term), and it should come with a clear example leveraging it in Platform.

Line:19, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/FactoryExampleWillBeRemoved.java -> Use examples/org.eclipse.jface.snippets for that.

Factory could be fine if found in the correct package. See other comment about the name. I'm fine with changing but it should not be long.
Line:33, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/Factory.java -> Name: Yes, I expected this comment. Reason why I try persuade reviewers to accept naming it "Factory" is:

It is in the resource package, package is part of the name.
ResourceFactory name is too long. It will clutter the code.

If you have a good short name suggestion, let me know. I'm afraid we are stuck with at least *Factory. Alternatively, I could make it a singleton so that we can use a short instance variable name.

SWT: Agreed, I will make a patch there

Platform leveraging: Sure, I think that will not be hard.

Sorry, I don't buy any arguments that assume that a shorter name is better, this is IMO not a safe assumption to rely on. Practically, let's more think about users: how will they find such Factory? I don't think they'll ever type "Factory" in search type, I also actually think that most people will simply not look for a utility class in that case.
To be honest, I'm not convinced that adding a lot of convenience APIs for relatively simple tasks is usually a good thing for the project as there is certainly a maintenance cost that comes with it while their is no clear value (unless we make the API really easy to discover and much more convenient to use).
For this case, I imagine the best discoverable and useful approach would be actually new constructors for Image and Font, taking as input a "parentWidget".

Line:33, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/Factory.java -> Name: Ok, point taken. 

It's a good idea to make it accessible from the main classes. I will work with that.

Ok based on Mickael's input it is now this:

	protected void createContents() {

		// With Factory
		compFactory.setBackgroundImage(Image.create(compFactory, getInputStream()));

		// Manual
		Image image = new Image(getDisplay(), getInputStream());
		addDisposeListener(e -> image.dispose());
		compManual.setBackgroundImage(image);

	}
