I updated your commit message after I moved you to a new bug.

The full bug link was well-meant but is unusual and in most places the bug number is automatically rendered as link.

In general the change looks good only with a small problem.

The "hide existing" option does not work. If you import a project from a directory and enable "hide existing" and then reopen the import dialog for the same directory the "hide existing" checkbox is selected but the already imported project is still shown.


And nice that you fixed the raw type warnings but in general it is better to provide such unrelated changes as separate gerrit. For such small cases it is not necessary to provide a separate bug.
Line:350, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> better named hideConflictingProjectsCheckbox like the other similar "Buttons"

Line:798, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> typo

Two more notes.

1. To your notice I opened https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=549155. Just in case you stumble over the same problem.

2. Did you notice that the "close imported" option does not work for archive imports? It's not your fault since it was this way before.

Hi Paul,
thanks for reviewing and cleaning up the bugzilla/gerrit mess ;)
Just added a patch set for the hide existing issue, you are totally correct, the ViewerFilter was not added according to the button selection!
