I'm also not sure.

I have no real authority in this question and to specific knowledge about the architecture, but here is my impression anyway:

SectionFactory should stay in o.e.ui.forms. It is fine for it to be located there, because Forms is already kind of a "utilities" bundle. It is not a basic building block like SWT.

SectionFactory should absolutely not go in JFace. JFace is a more basic component than Forms, and should have no dependency on Forms. Forms should be regarded as a 3:rd party componentent as far as JFace is concerned.

This situation will be interesting for the Widget Factory project:

You have to design a way in which the factories can be extended by 3:rd party components. Remember that every thing that you publish to such components is no longer an internal implementation detail, but is frozen for ever to avoid breaking client code!
