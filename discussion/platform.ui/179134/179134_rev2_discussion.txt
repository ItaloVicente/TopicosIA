This is yet another instance of the main problem in our build system when using build-individual-bundles - it builds against the I-builds bundle not from the maven reactor.

Alex, I can't understand that, I'm not Maven user.
The build fails now because of ... what?
What exactly the problem is with maven?
On Gerrit it seem to use some other version of the code that it should actually compile, why?
Can we just merge that patch, or same issue will also happen on official build?

I've misunderstood the compiler error. Now it was the opposite because the old dependency was used due missing version update. Now it should work, with the next patch
