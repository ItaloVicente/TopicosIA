DESCRIPTION:

Bug 537967 - [Quick Access] Commands not matched by description

Use new getMatchLabel() to get the text to match elements against.

With the changes for preference pages, previous getLabel() and
getSortLabel() had a target conflict regarding matching vs sorting vs
display. The cleanest way to match against not displayed text seems to
be to make the match string explicit instead of reusing these methods.

The patch looks good.
However, this is the kind of change that's very visible in UI and that we should protect against future regression. Do you think you can add a few test cases about this bug?

Already on it. I'm currently struggling a bit with the test project's dependencies, but will try my luck with the Oomph setup and hope it works that way.
