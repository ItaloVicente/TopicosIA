This code actually brings in a lot of new dependencies to the Activator for logging. To be honest, I am not 100% sure about the tracing mechanism, but didn't we want to remove Activator related code and replace it with more general things? E.g. the OSGi R7 logging? But of course than we loose the .options stuff if my understanding is correct.

Anyhow it can not be merged as of now, and I wonder about the bundle version sind new public constants are introduced.

Which dependencies? I don't see any new.

Not in this task :-)

Yep. I can't use logger because it will ignore any tracing option specified in .options.

Why?

All the code is internal, no API is changed here.

Okay, since the Activator still exists and is in use, it is not going worse. But the commit says you need to rebase as it can not be merged. ;)
