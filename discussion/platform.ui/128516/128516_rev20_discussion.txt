DESCRIPTION:

Bug 538480 - Offer code completion for selecting the directory in
the workspace selection dialog

ReopenableContentProposalAdapter extends ContentProposalAdapter
instead of ContentAssistCommandAdapter as the latter expects
a WorkBench to be loaded.
This also forces ReopenableContentProposalAdapter to reimplement the
FieldDecoration logic in ContentAssistCommandAdapter.

No, you where right, the changes where missing. Sorry about that.
I managed to make a mess with Git that day.

Line:39, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/DirectoryProposalContentAssistTestCase.java -> Not sure what I'm missing but the pop-up is not reliably open after waiting for it with this method..

Line:100, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/DirectoryProposalContentAssistTestCase.java -> This seems rather silly. There should be a better way?
