DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574639 - Lazy initialize external Editors

To speed up Eclipse startup:
EditorRegistry now has distinct map for OS Editors.
Map of OS Editors is only initialized if internal Editor is not found.

Also caches the OS Editors which speeds up repeated start of the Dialog:
"Preferences/General/Editors/File Associations/Add.../External programs"

This assumes OS Editor never changes.
You now need to restart Eclipse after adding a new OS Editor if you need
to add it in Eclipse. Like before the EditorRegistry does not know of
newly created OS Editors anyway.

Build and test are OK, but Eclipse project is currently in a code freeze period.
Please wait for end of code freeze period before merging.

It would be good if you could split this into several patches: 1 about splitting the map of editors, another about caching OS editors and so on.
Line:154, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> Such pattern are a bit tricky to understand and maintain IMO.
Wouldn't it be more readable to create a dedicated Supplier<Map<String, IEditorDescriptor>> that would take core of caching/computing when necessary?

Line:331, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> Is it the topic of this bug?

Line:492, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> Is this the topic of this bug? Display.syncExec() can usually be a cause of deadlocks, so we should avoid it as much as possible.

I can do. Its just much more complicated to do so since it will create additional changes which will be undone with the second patch.

And the are not orthogonal - you can only rollback them in the reverse order submited. The "problem" is that previously the initalization was not always in static methods.
Line:154, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> well i do not want to overcomplicate things. and everbody can google "Initialization-on-demand holder idiom" before changing something here.

Line:331, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> absolutely! if the INTERNAL editor was not found use (and initialize) LazyOSEditorsHolder.... Thats the essence of this change.

Line:492, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> I do not like it too. Therefore i requested bug 575550. Until we agree to solve 575550 this is needed (copied from eclipse.ui):
Already before we implicitly required that Program.getPrograms() was called in UI thread. And luckyly it was done in that way by eclipse.ui. 
If now someone else would calls the lazy initialisation by findEditor() and is not in the UI thread (+ 575550 not solved + he is on linux) he would get an Error where he did not get one before.
In Eclipse IDE the lazy initialization still happens only in the UI thread - so syncExec runs in fact in the same thread. I added this just in case a 3rd party would make the first call to findEditor from a non-UI thread.
I do not see how a deadlock would be possible as Program.getPrograms() does not lock anything.

Line:154, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> If the getter are only used by suppliers to initialize content, then they'd better be in the suppliers directly.
Something like

  Supplier<IEditorDescriptor[]> lazySortedEditorsFromOSHolder = new Supplier<>() {
     private IEditorDescriptor[] value = null;
     @Override public IEditorDescriptor[] get() {
       if (value != null) {
         return value;
       }
       synchronized (this) {
         if (value == null) {
           value = getStaticSortedEditorsFromOS();
         }
       }
       return value;
     }

     public static IEditorDescriptor[] getStaticSortedEditorsFromOS() {
        //...
     }
  };

Sure, it's more verbose (that's why Guava has a Suppliers.memorize()), but it better separates the initialization out of the consuming class and as it's more explicit, it is much easier to understand and maintain without have to Google.

Line:154, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> "if (value != null) {
         return value;
       }" 
is not threadsafe. You better google "Initialization-on-demand holder idiom" :-)

And it is not THAT simple to have a Supplier, as the class would need also a reset() like function which would. Please see the change in addExternalEditorsToEditorMap() in the follow up patch:

Line:154, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> I think using a pattern that one has to run a search to understand as it relies on deep internal of the language execution is actually overcomplating things, compared to using a Supplier that anyone can understand without deep knowledge of VM internals.

Line:154, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> Well you need any double check pattern to solve the. There are only two "Initialization-on-demand holder idiom" and "synchronize". You need to understand both anyway if you want proper multithreading.
I do not mind much which w use but "Initialization-on-demand holder idiom" is in general the better one.
If you look in the newest Patch you will find "getter" methods for both instances which are the suppliers you have asked for. and The holders are only one possible implementation of them.
If you still do not like it please make a concrete suggestion how it would be better.

Line:331, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> It would be interesting to investigate first why this is triggered at startup before we merge it, to hopefully identify a root cause. Maybe there is a simpler patch that can be find somewhere else that would benefit to other pieces of code.

Line:331, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> But couldn't the case of "org.eclipse.e4.ui.compatibility.editor" be a separate commit, independently of lazy loading? I don't really get what it has to appear now and why it has to be part of the same change as lazy loading.

Line:331, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> I can't either; but I don't like the idea of merging potential workarounds here, while the rest of the patch is same.
So it would be great if you could move this particular piece of code to a separate commit, that we can discuss separately, so we could move forward with merging the latest patch set that just separates internal/external editors (and then later patch set about caching them) when 4.22 is open for business.

Line:331, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/registry/EditorRegistry.java -> I wish it would be like that. Unfortunatly this whole patch does not make sense if during eclipse startup the Lazy initialisation is triggered. But - up to my debugging - it IS unfortunatly triggered because findEditor("org.eclipse.e4.ui.compatibility.editor") IS called during startup (and returns null). I do not have the time to figure out why it is called.

Good thing is that now starts RC phase for some time, so we can maybe focus on bug 575550 in the meantime so we don't have to keep the workaround here.
