DESCRIPTION:

Bug 540280 - Reverts "Bug 380555 - do not allow InjectionException fly
through in
execute()"

The fix for Bug 380555 prevents exceptions to be visible on the command
line.
This breaks all reporting for errors in handlers and hence leaves the
customer no information what went wrong.

Reverted to fix this regression.

This reverts commit ec184d7d60500ceac26b9e0c76514d34dc0029ca.

Sorry Andrey, but this regression is critical for several of my customers. This needs to be reverted and new approaches can be tested via new bugs.

Lars, can you please look at https://git.eclipse.org/r/131156? It is not the right solution to let exceptions be handled by swt event table.

Sorry Andrey, this is critical and nothing we should review around 22:00. I have customers with production issues due to this regression. Please open a new bug with your patch and we can test and review without pressure. The old approach was used for years and we know it is working.

Why should we open a new bug if the right solution for this bug is already there? If you wish, you can merge this patch and tomorrow I will revert it and apply patch https://git.eclipse.org/r/131156 because this will be the right solution. But do we really want to do this? What is the reason to have it today? If your customer need an urgent fix, they should build SDK, they can patch whatever they want and wait for 4.10 with the right patch. You don't want your customer run 4.10 nightly build, or do you?

It is not customer it is really "customers" like in plural which are affects by this. This regression cost me a significant time and cause signifcant stress for several people during the last days and I will not have the time to test this properly in the next hours or days. Once we have a fixed I-Build they can use this during development and after EclipseCon I should have time to test and review the new patch. If this involves a revert for the original fix I do not see anything bad in this.
