DESCRIPTION:

Bug 417255 - Race Condition in DecorationScheduler

Decoration requests that were scheduled in quick succession could result
in requests getting lost, because scheduling attempts were ignored if
the previous decoration request had not yet been updated to the UI.

Test case added in this commit and Bugzilla document the scenarios in
more detail.

To solve this, the collection of decoration results was made thread-safe
and some detection logic was added for whether it is the update job or
other logic checking that a decoration is ready before scheduling the
request. Also adding the same decoration context to an existing
decoration request multiple times is prevented to simplify result
caching.

Thanks for the javadoc!

To summarize; every label update will cause a new decoration except if it was triggered synchronously by the change event, right?
Line:609, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> this is always called on the UI, so I would replace the threadlocal with a simple boolean

File Comment: tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/tests/navigator/Bug417255Test.java -> please replace the bug id in java code with a functional name (e.g. DecorationSchedulerRaceConditionTest)
Line:144, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/tests/navigator/Bug417255Test.java -> the test itself seems to have a race condition. It runs green most of the time even if I revert isDecorationReady()

Again thanks for your valuable comments, Julian.
Sorry I was a bit taken up by other more pressing issues, but I have now managed to address your findings.
Line:609, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> Done

File Comment: tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/tests/navigator/Bug417255Test.java -> Done
Line:144, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/tests/navigator/Bug417255Test.java -> Yes you are right, the test case did not use enough synchronization points with the decoration scheduler thread so we still had some parts of the code executed in parallel. That is fixed now (makes the test case more complex and difficult to understand, unfortunately ... :-( )
