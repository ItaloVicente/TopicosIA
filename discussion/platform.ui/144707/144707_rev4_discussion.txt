DESCRIPTION:

Bug 417255 - Race Condition in DecorationScheduler

Decoration requests that were scheduled in quick succession could result
in requests getting lost, because scheduling attempts were ignored if
the previous decoration request had not yet been updated to the UI.

Test case added in this commit and Bugzilla document the scenarios in
more detail.

To solve this, the collection of decoration results was made thread-safe
and some detection logic was added for whether it is the update job or
other logic checking that a decoration is ready before scheduling the
request. Also adding the same decoration context to an existing
decoration request multiple times is prevented to simplify result
caching.

Some minor comments, I haven't understood the change in isDecorationReady yet and leave that for tomorrow...

In any case; this needs a second reviewer, because I don't know that code. Seems like no one has touched its functionality for years - Lars, suggestions?
Line:40, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationReference.java -> can be final

Line:322, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> why was this removed?

Line:92, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> shorter: ThreadLocal.withInitial

Line:513, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/tests/navigator/LabelProviderTest.java -> can you extract your additions in a new test class?

Line:575, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/tests/navigator/LabelProviderTest.java -> you can use a JobChangeAdapter here

Line:618, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/tests/navigator/LabelProviderTest.java -> commit should be obsolete with your fix, right?

I have updated the changeset and also added JavaDoc to DecorationScheduler which explains a bit better how it works (at least to my understanding after reading and debugging the existing code)
Line:40, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationReference.java -> Done

Line:322, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> Because of the race condition:
If the element has been processed earlier, it is contained in the resultCache.
Let's assume that, while the decorator job is still running, a decoration request is enqueued for the same element again, because some base data changes.
The decoration job would call ensureResultCached again for the element, but this check would result in the decoration not being recalculated. Thus the decoration request is lost.

The original check was there most likely, because DecorationReference did not check for identical contexts in addContext(), so multiple calls to addContext with the same element and context would lead to multiple calls to ensureResultCached in the loop in line 299 and this would lead to unnecessary performance drops because the same decoration would be calculated over and over again.

Therefore, I removed the check for the result being already cached here, and instead made sure that identical contexts can only be added once in DecorationReference.

Line:92, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> Done
