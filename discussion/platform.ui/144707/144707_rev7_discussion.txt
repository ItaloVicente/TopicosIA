DESCRIPTION:

Bug 417255 - Race Condition in DecorationScheduler

Decoration requests that were scheduled in quick succession could result
in requests getting lost, because scheduling attempts were ignored if
the previous decoration request had not yet been updated to the UI.

Test case added in this commit and Bugzilla document the scenarios in
more detail.

To solve this, the collection of decoration results was made thread-safe
and some detection logic was added for whether it is the update job or
other logic checking that a decoration is ready before scheduling the
request. Also adding the same decoration context to an existing
decoration request multiple times is prevented to simplify result
caching.

I can't completely judge if this 100% correct, but from looking at the test cases and the great docs this looks fine to me.
Just some minors to consider.
Line:31, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationReference.java -> Although used only internal, the typical notion of empty arrays uses the type. "ARRAY" is a bit generic.
I propose to use "EMPTY_DECORATION_CONTEXTS".

Line:95, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> remove "is"
=> the call originates from

Line:96, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> in => from

Line:107, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> great explanation! +1

Line:115, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/decorators/DecorationScheduler.java -> The type here could just be map, i.e. 
   Map<IDecorationContext, ConcurrentHashMap<Object, DecorationResult>>

Do you think the concrete type is better here?

You could make this private when you are already on it.

Line:84, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/tests/navigator/extension/DecorationSchedulerRaceConditionTestDecorator.java -> I prefer to guard and fast return to avoid long indented if blocks, i.e. 

if (!(element instanceof IProject)) {
  return;
}


WDYT?
