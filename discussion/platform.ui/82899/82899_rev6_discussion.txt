DESCRIPTION:

Bug 264404 - Problem decorators on Resources Project Explorer

This adds the problem marker decoration to resources, via the Resource
CNF extension.
Some performance should have been improved by avoiding multiple refresh
operations on same "branch" in the tree (only refreshing the highest
one).
The patch also include the possibility for JFace's DecorationOverlayIcon
to take an ImageDescriptor as input.

Works as expected, but changes to DecorationOverlayIcon should be tracked by another bug. JDT can also decorate without those changes.

Please see comments in code.
File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/DecorationOverlayIcon.java -> This is definitely a better version, and as Dani pointed out, it would be better in a different commit (if needed at all).

Small style issue: please check how new lines are used - they seem to be randomly added, I see no system.
Line:64, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/DecorationOverlayIcon.java -> new line?

Line:72, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/DecorationOverlayIcon.java -> new line?

Line:127, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/DecorationOverlayIcon.java -> overlayDescriptor

Line:136, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/DecorationOverlayIcon.java -> extra new line?

Line:147, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/workbench/ResourceExtensionContentProvider.java -> and -> add

Line:93, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/workbench/ResourceExtensionLabelProvider.java -> I would mute this error, because it will most likely pop up if the resource or marker was deleted diring the decorator run.

Thanks for the review.
I'm not sure I properly understand the comment. So I should open a new bug for OverlayDescriptorIcon, and mark it as a requirement for this one?
JDT has a JavaUILabelProvider which allows decorators to deal with it. I believe using similar approach would require changing much more code than the proposal.
