Many files seem to be formatted with 80 characters line length while I have 120 characters what seems to be eclipse default. That is why there are some discrepancies. A complete reformat of all files within a project needs only a few seconds and would safe us from wasting a lot of time on formating issues as you can repeat that step then. Do you think it would be possible to reformat everything?

I know the auto-formatting issue is a nuisance. But I think re-formatting all code would be kind of a large undertaking, and that we have to learn to handle working with incorrectly formatted code anyway.

Here are a few techniques to prevent the auto-formatting feature from adding a lot of unrelated formatting changes:

* Be vigilant when saving files. If you notice any unwanted formatting changes on save, hit Ctrl+Z. Only the auto-format changes will get undone.

* Check the diff when you are finished with a file, and remove unwanted formatting changes right away.

* When using `git gui` it is easy to add just parts of a file to Git, or remove just some changes to a file from a commit. Using this feature you can easily remove accidentally formatted lines before pushing. (Maybe there is some way to do this with the Eclipse EGit tools also.)

@Lars Vogel:

Are there some kind of code reviewer norm for how to handle changes with unrelated formatting changes?

Should we demand that all such changes are removed from the Gerrit change?

Or is it acceptable, although undesirable, with unrelated formatting changes?

Thanks Carsten! The code looks so much better when it's updated with new for-loops!
Line:236, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.databinding/src/org/eclipse/jface/internal/databinding/viewers/ViewerElementMap.java -> Removing this changes the behaviour a tiny bit, but that's okay.

Why did they copy the collection to an array it the original code anyway? To handle concurrent modifications? That's a poor way to achieve that.

Preferably formatting changes should go in separate Gerrits. You can do a mass format for a project via the Source menu but most committers prefer not to for at files if they are not affected by changes to keep Fit blame functionality easy. So if certain files require reformating for such changes -> +1, reformating just for the fun-> -1

Need manual rebase, most likely due to the requested reformat of MenuManager. Carsten, please update, this should be good to do.
