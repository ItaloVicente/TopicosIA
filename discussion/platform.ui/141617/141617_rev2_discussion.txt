Jens, another one from Carsten which touches databinding. In case you have time, please review. This is not urgent.

We you want I can to the whole lot of "Use jdk 5 for loop" changes.

They are simple, and they have many of the same issues. (Some  indentation with spaces, some weird loop variable names.)

@Carsten Hammer:

Thanks for your contribution!

Ḯ'll look at this in detail when you have addressed the issues I mentioned on the other Gerrit change:

I see a few style issues with the patches that are repeating, both in one and the others. I think you should fix them in all of the patches before other reviewers look at them.

* Many loop variables have poor names. Look through them and update them to something better.

Example: Rename `retainAll1` to `elem` or `e` or `toRetainElem`.

* There is new indentation that uses spaces instead of tabs. It should be all tabs.

* Minor thing: The languages construct is called the "for-each loop". It's better to use this term in the commit message, instead of "jdk 5 for loop"..

Carsten, I see you pushing similar Gerrits for Equinox. We typically prefer that a contributor finish fixing the issues already identified in existing reviews instead of pushing new similar Gerrits.

Can you fix the reported problems so that we can start merging your requests?

Hi Lars,
sorry but first I need a working and reliable way to work on the issues.
I prefer a step by step approach and now checked if I can create a patch set that is basically conformant to the requirements.
I tried different approaches to create and edit the gerrits and it seems some of these are basically unusable. You have seen that on push of an update on one gerrit suddenly I get old versions in another, files suddenly reappearing, fixes in the formatting suddenly reverted and so on. I do not understand all problems... This way I can only work on a single patch at a time until it is merged. 
And before you ask: not a single line has commited or reviewed using netbeans - it is all 100% the last version of eclipse for commiters that I use.  
It is extremly time consuming to find a file and a position mentioned in the gerrit review in the projects within eclipse. And after you edit the formatting you do barely see the difference. 
Maybe if Mylyn would be working, I don't know but currently I first have to do research for a "modus operandi"..

Especially in this case, focus on one change, fix it and after it was merged do the next. No use to fill up our review queue with bad Gerrits

Right, maybe better to close the worst gerrits now. I can do it most probably better now but maybe it would make sense to wait until I found a way to edit them in a reliable way. Should I close them or do you want to make a choose?
Sorry for that..

Carsten, let me assure you that I love cleanup and code improvement patches.

I suggest you focus on this one to fix all the remaining issues. During this process you will most like learn more about Gerrit and Eclipse. Once is has been merge you can use this knowledge to fix your other Gerrits.

Thanks for helping the Eclipse IDE with your patch, it would be great if you can finish what you started.

I understand that you are confused about working with Git, Gerrit and the Eclipse tools. I was too when I started working with this!

But these things don't have to be complicated. You just have to come up with good ways to do them. Different people  prefer to do things in different ways. Here are a few pointers about how I do things:

> It is extremly time consuming to find a file and a position mentioned in the gerrit review in the projects within eclipse.

You can use the Open Type command (Ctrl+Shift+T) in Eclipse to open the right class, then use Go to Line (Ctrl+L).

You can also open a file from the terminal by typing `eclipse <filename>`.

> I tried different approaches to create and edit the gerrits

I prefer to use terminal Git most of the time, instead of using the Git tools in Eclipse. I find that this makes it clearer to me exactly what is being changed. That way it is easy to keep every change on their own branch. Of course, you have to learn some Git for that.

Even if you push your change using Eclipse I think it's easier to inspect the state of the code with the standard Git tools.

Try navigating to a project root and use these commands:

git gui

gitk --all

>  And after you edit the formatting you do barely see the difference. 

Try setting Eclipse to show whitespace characters:

Preferences > General > Text Editors > Show whitespace characters

> fixes in the formatting suddenly reverted and so on.

Maybe things are getting changed because files are getting auto-formatted when they are saved? That's a thing to watch out for. To cancel to auto-formatting, do an undo (Ctrl+Z) right after saving. It's a good thing to do a Git diff after saving (for example using `git gui`) to watch for accidental formatting changes.
