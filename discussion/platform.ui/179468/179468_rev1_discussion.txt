DESCRIPTION:

Bug 572939 - Save Resources dialog: Improve usability

In the "Save Resources" dialog improve usability by better buttons
labeling and enablement.

If more than one editor is dirty, the "Save Resources" dialog is shown
when exiting (File > Exit) or when closing all editors (Ctrl+Shift+W):

(a) In order not to save files/resources, you must first click on
"Deselect All" and then on "Save Selected". It feels wrong to me when I
have to click "Save Selected" for don't save.
=> OK button: "Don't Save" when no resource is selected, otherwise "Save
<n> of <m>" (<n> number of selected resources; <m> total number of
resources)

(b) The "Select All" button is enabled even when all resources are
selected and the "Deselect All" button is enabled even when no resource
is selected. Hitting the button in such a case will have no effect.
=> Disable the corresponding button in such cases

(c) The button labels "Select All" and "Deselect All" make the concept
of the selection explicit to the user: the resources to be saved must be
added to the selection which then has to be confirmed. When asked which
resources to save, I just want to say "All" or "None" instead of
explicitly putting the resources into a selection that can then be
submitted for saving.
=> Shorten "Select All" to "All" and "Deselect All" to "None"

I find "Don't Save" is probably not explicit enough and remains confusing besides "Cancel". I think "Continue without saving" and "Save & Continue" would be more explicit.

I would prefer "Discard Changes" (since as a user I actively delete all my changes by clicking on the button, even if it is technically only skipping the save action), but "Don't Save" is what is currently displayed for a single resource. Maybe we could do that in a separate change. It would also be nice if the dialog title would be the name of the action/command, i.e. "Exit" or "Close All Editors".

"Discard changes" is IMO incorrect in general: changes do remain, they're not saved (this dialog is also shown in case of eg launches, not only when closing some editors).
This dialog is usually 1 step of bigger workflows, the buttons need to capture the difference between "Cancel" (stopping the workflow) and "Don't Save" (continuing the workflow).
Actually, I think "Continue" and "Cancel" are good labels in all cases.

I would rather avoiding changing that in a separate further change, but instead splitting this one into smaller chunks (eg buttons activation, all/none labels, dialog title...) would probably make sense.

Having the dialog title reminding the "calling" action would probably make a lot of sense, for the same reason mentioned above.

"Don't Save" is used in the dialog for a single dirty editor. Here, in the dialog for more than one dirty editor, the same wording has to be used to not break internal consistency. If the wording should be changed, then it should be discussed and done for both dialogs, the dialog for one and the dialog for multiple resources, as a separate change. (I have not yet understood what you mean by "changes do remain, they're not saved". IMHO and according to what I have learned and been teached about usability, the dialog title should be the name of the bigger workflow. Otherwise, it would be unclear what "Cancel" cancels. The dialog gives me the option to either take a step in the bigger workflow or cancel the bigger workflow. Preferably, instead of "OK", the non-"Cancel" buttons should name the step. Closing the dialog and continuing in the bigger workflow is implicit.)

The commit message lists three things. (a) is the main thing I would like to change and which is based on (b). For (b) and (c), patcheset 1 extends the org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.ListSelectionDialog which is public API that can also be used by others. If this change should be split into smaller chunks, please tell me how the API should look like. Doing it as one change (at least (b) and (c)) would have the advantage of having to add only one more constructor or method. It would also be good if it would be possible to set the title in the extended API, which is not the case so far (nor in the current API nor via the second ListSelectionDialog constructor added by patchset 1). What do you think? How should the API look like?

OK, I see.
I think this is still better than current state and is worth merging.
However, the discussion has highlighted that the main issue is more often the dialog title than the buttons; and that the button label would probably need to be reworked when we have better integration of the workspace in the bigger workflow (so button would become "Don't Save and Launch" or "Save 2 of 4 and Exit") and so on.

Patch Set 1:

Now I got it. When the dialog is displayed when launching an application, "Discard Changes" would be wrong since the dirty editors will not be closed in contrast to when "Close All Editors" or to when "Exit". I agree, "Launch without Saving" (or even better "Run", "Debug", etc. instead of "Launch") and "Save 2 of 4 and Launch" would be nice in this case. For "Exit", I would prefer "Discard Changes and Exit"/"Save 2 of 4 and Exit", whereas for "Close All Editors" just "Discard Changes"/"Save 2 of 4".

How about doing it in two chunks/changes? First the extension of the API of org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.ListSelectionDialog and then using the new API in the "Save Resource" dialog. Using the old API would not change the behavior. When using the new API, the "Select/Deselect All" would be enabled/disabled based on the current selection and the labels of the buttons would be shorten to "All" and "None" (for consistency, the new API should not provide parameters not to do so). In the new API there would be a parameter for the title adn two parameters for the OK button label, one for an empty and one for a non-empty selection. There might be additional optional parameters for common optional use cases like an additional checkbox or for the SWT.SHEET style flag.

Alternatively, this change could also be made without extending the API. In patchset 1 I did not find any other way than to extend the API to access/listen to the "Select/Deselect All" buttons. But after looking at other clients, I guess it's possible via getButton(IDialogConstants.SELECT_ALL_ID).addSelectionListener(listener) without extending the API.

I would like implement the alternative first and create a bug for extending ListSelectionDialog. Okay?

I'm actually unsure that "All" or "None" are good labels for buttons, as buttons usually call for verbs and trigger "major" actions. But All and None are good labels. I'm wondering whether it would be better to have them as links as they don't directly have impact on the workflow.

I'd like to avoid any form of API or enablement flag for that: we should assume that what we're doing with this dialog, which is API, is best for all consumers and push improvements without having to opt-in. So the change we make to the dialog automatically cascade to added value for all consumers.

PS: See https://ci.eclipse.org/platform/job/eclipse.platform.ui-Gerrit/24694/consoleFull and please try setting up an API baseline in your IDE. The version must become x.y+1.0 because of API additions.

Bug 573221 created to general improve ListSelectionDialog, not only the "Save Resources" dialog that  subclasses ListSelectionDialog.
