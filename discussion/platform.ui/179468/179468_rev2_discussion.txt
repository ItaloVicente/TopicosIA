DESCRIPTION:

Bug 572939 - Save Resources dialog: Improve usability

In the "Save Resources" dialog improve usability by better buttons
labeling and enablement.

If more than one editor is dirty, the "Save Resources" dialog is shown
when exiting (File > Exit) or when closing all editors (Ctrl+Shift+W):

(a) In order not to save files/resources, you must first click on
"Deselect All" and then on "Save Selected". It feels wrong to me when I
have to click "Save Selected" for don't save.
=> OK button: "Don't Save" when no resource is selected, otherwise "Save
<n> of <m>" (<n> number of selected resources; <m> total number of
resources)

(b) The "Select All" button is enabled even when all resources are
selected and the "Deselect All" button is enabled even when no resource
is selected. Hitting the button in such a case will have no effect.
=> Disable the corresponding button in such cases

(c) The button labels "Select All" and "Deselect All" make the concept
of the selection explicit to the user: the resources to be saved must be
added to the selection which then has to be confirmed. When asked which
resources to save, I just want to say "All" or "None" instead of
explicitly putting the resources into a selection that can then be
submitted for saving.
=> Shorten "Select All" to "All" and "Deselect All" to "None"

This change is waiting/depends on change 179930:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui/+/179930

Based on the following Mickael's feedback (see above):
> ...
> I'd like to avoid any form of API or enablement flag for that: we should assume that what we're doing with this dialog, which is API, is best for all consumers and push improvements without having to opt-in. So the change we make to the dialog automatically cascade to added value for all consumers.
> ...
change 179930 has been created to do it more generally in ListSelectionDialog (e.g. "Select/Deselect All" button enablement) and make it easier for clients (providing a new API so that ListSelectionDialog does not need to be extended).
