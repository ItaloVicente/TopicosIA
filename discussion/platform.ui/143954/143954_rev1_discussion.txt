Is anything missing here? 

For some reason there are a couple of other open gerrits each fixing the same warning in a couple of files.

There are still a lot more open raw type warnings after this change. I made my change a few weeks ago and then was (as so often) to lazy to finalize and upload it immediately.

The other open gerrits coincidentally doing the same but (to my observation) most do not conflict with this one.

But I saw you found at least one conflicting change.

So please rebase and push so we get rid of these things ASAP.
