DESCRIPTION:

Bug 485167 Bring UI Test Suite launch target in line with Tycho
configuration

When the UI Test Suite is launched from Tycho, the test plug-in
dependencies are used for resolving the plug-ins that are included in
the launch target. When the Eclipse launch target is used, all plug-ins
in the current workspace are used. As a result of the different test
environments some test cases fail when run with the Eclipse launch
target: ProgressViewTests, ObjectContributionTest, among others.

This commit changes the Eclipse launch target to be in line with the
Tycho behavior. A new feature is introduced to define the the test
runtime platform configuration. The launch target uses only this feature
to determine the runtime platform.

For me on macOS the new launch config does not start properly. Shortly a shell comes up, but then it is closed again. The JUnit view does not show executed tests. When I replace the launch file with master it works again. Not sure yet what is missing here.
Line:2, features/org.eclipse.ui.tests.feature/feature.properties -> You work for Altran, right? Then you should mention it here.

Line:12, features/org.eclipse.ui.tests.feature/feature.properties -> remove this line

Line:32, features/org.eclipse.ui.tests.feature/feature.properties -> Altran

Line:42, features/org.eclipse.ui.tests.feature/feature.properties -> remove line

The patch includes a new feature, make sure that is included in your workspace before starting the test. If you add '-consoleLog' to the launch config you will notice that it complains about a missing bundle. Note however that it does *not* complain about the missing feature.
Line:2, features/org.eclipse.ui.tests.feature/feature.properties -> Yes, I work for Altran, but I do this work on my personal time/title.
