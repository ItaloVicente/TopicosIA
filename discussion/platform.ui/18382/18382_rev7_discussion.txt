I like the direction this is going.  But I'd like to avoid using the VolatileResource pattern.  I'll put my suggestions on the bug.
Line:29, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> The emf import package doesn't do anything, should be removed.

Line:75, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/helpers/CSSSWTColorHelper.java -> Since this item would be disposed on the first widget re-processed, there would be other widgets out there with the disposed font.

Line:230, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/helpers/CSSSWTFontHelper.java -> The IColorAndFontProvider is back by a 3.x ITheme and its ColorRegistry and FontRegistry.  If a rule is setting the font family to a font definition, we should get the Font from the IColorAndFontProvider.  Then we are not responsible for disposing it.

Line:251, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/helpers/CSSSWTFontHelper.java -> The first time we hit this there will be other widgets that are still set to the now disposed font.

Line:63, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/css2/CSSPropertyFontSWTHandler.java -> Why does this only update the font if it is not already set?

Line:31, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/resources/FontByDefinition.java -> Isn't this derived from the font that was passed in?

Line:28, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/resources/VolatileResource.java -> setResource should probably do a setValid for free, so it doesn't have to be done elsewhere.

Line:791, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/WBWRenderer.java -> Is there more than one CSSEngine for the application?  I thought there was only one, so we would only want to do one invalidate and re-apply (not one per workbench window).
