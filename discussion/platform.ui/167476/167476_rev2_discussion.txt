DESCRIPTION:

Bug 565951 - CTabFolder content can use default BG instead of tab color

By default, the background color is now used to print the tab content
background in CTabRendering.
This can be overridden and re-enabled by accessing a new setter in
ICTabRendering, or by customizing the
swt-draw-custom-tab-content-background CSS property.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:30, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/light/e4-light_tabstyle.css -> It is actually related, because without such padding, then there is a useless delimiter drawn between the tab and the composite under it, which makes the UI heavier and less clear.
And padding: 0px actually works for me. Can you please elaborate in which way it's not supported? It's not very clear from the bug report you linked, and I didn't really see any issue with it so far, only benefits (less lines visible, a few pixels saved...).  I understand that Mike has to tweak padding in his case of specific SashLayout, which is not the default case of Platform. The padding is the distance between the "outer" CTabFolder and the content of the CTab (eg the workspace tree), setting it from 2 to 0 doesn't impact how view layout one relatively to the other, it only has effect inside the view.
