Patch Set 6: Code-Review-1

(2 comments)

I did not do any testing, just reviewing code, so my conclusions might be premature. But I think that this change causes regressions w.r.t. the (stored) defaults of the wizard.
Line:763, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> Additional whiteline

Line:1522, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> Isn't this the only place where the problem occurs? (from just reviewing the code)
If so, it might be sufficient to change the check to include archive files, which imply copyFiles.

How can I test this? Do you mean when switching between import directory to import archive and then back? In this case both checkboxes stay ticked. Didn't know if the original state should be restored or not.
Line:1522, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> copyFiles is also used in the import process itself. Not sure if this get activated. My fix mostly came from the observation that depending on what I had clicked before switching to import achieve the behavior is different. Also how should the nestedProjects flag be treated then. As both checkboxes are marked active when switching to import from archive, I thought both flags should be set as well.

First concern here is that the state will also be saved in persistent settings, however the change for Bug 549155 will prevent this (lines 1656).
But this should also not happen when just switching between directory and archive.


The main issue you have in your bug report is that conflicting project names are not detected correctly. This check could be done on line 1509, to include archives.
Also, it would be really helpful to add a testcase to ImportExistingProjectsWizardTest to prevent regressions.
Line:849, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> Here the previous state of the options is restored to be in line with the nestedProjects/copyFiles as stored. Note that these options are also stored in STORE_COPY_PROJECT_ID around line 1656 and restored around line 1573.
