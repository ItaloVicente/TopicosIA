Patch Set 3:

Are you planning to merge an API addition today or tomorrow? If not, why did you increase the minor version to 10? This is now causing an API Tools error in the workspace and a warning in our official build:

If my merge window was not stolen from me time after time, I would have pushed the change already. My plan was to push it directly after this commit. However every time before my rebased build was finished another patch was pushed in.
If development says busy like this, we need some way to manage this.

It would be good to mention the related/triggering change in the commit message, especially since this change here is not connected to a bug report.
So, do you plan to merge that change today? ;-)

If this happens to me and I have several Success builds and the new changes are not in the same area, I simply merge. While this is a little, little risk, waiting for a clean merge window is difficult after such a LOOOOONG ;-) release freeze with so many pending patches.
