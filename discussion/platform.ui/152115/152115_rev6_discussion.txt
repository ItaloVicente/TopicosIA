DESCRIPTION:

Bug 552691 - [Dark theme] Rename dialog has white artifacts

We need to keep the Shell selector as it otherwise also styles the
Composite in an editor. A future enhancement might be to target the
Composite in the editor with a special rule so that we can ensure all
elements in a Component are styled.
