DESCRIPTION:

Bug 572598 - Toolbar of a View not created / visible

The widgets of a perspective are recursively disposed when reseting the
perspective. This even disposes shared widgets. To prevent this
disposing, first recursively close the elements that will be removed.

Also cleanup of obsolete code that was leftover of previous toolbar
rendering changes.

Rolf, I must confess, I've tried to grok over this again, but failed again, and I have no time to read through that code to understand how it is supposed to work. One thing: could you separate the fix from cleanup please (just push another commit with the cleanup)? I have no idea what is what :-)

If you are confident, please merge.
Note: fails are unrelated, reported https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=573393.

Hi, I will clean up, in fact that cleanup causes a regression too... I have been digging around the renderers some more to see if this is indeed the correct solution. I am fairly confident that it will work, will do some more testing. My general feeling now is that over time many responsibilities between the engine different renderers are entangled, which makes the code hard to understand.

Also this change doesn't directly address the bug, but adds behavior that should be called when elements get hidden anyhow. And child elements are first hidden before un-rendered. The side-effect of this is that in this case the child elements are not pre-maturely disposed. I will try to update the commit message too, to better reflect what is really going on.
