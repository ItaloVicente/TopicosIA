Stream are useless without generic support in StructuredSelection in 1st place. It's relatively easy and standard for people who need stream to so Arrays.stream(selection.toArray()).cast(TheirClass.class::cast). No need for extra API in Platform to take care of that.

This adds generic support to the selection that will otherwise never be possible to implement without breaking backward compatibility.

Beside from helping people to avoid boilerplate over and over again it allows implementations of IStructuredSelection(s) to choose more efficient approaches. also your example
> Arrays.stream(selection.toArray()).cast(TheirClass.class::cast)
suffers from the fact that its prone to class cast exceptions.

I even included a use-case where platform code can use this new feature an is simplified with less warnings/supression required.

I even included a

Please bring the case to Eclipse PMC here.
I support the idea that adding APIs adds technical debt and maintenance cost  and that unless an API is proven as being really helping users, new APIs should be avoided. More is not better, and shorter doesn't mean clearer.
Standard java has very good ways to deal with streams in that case, and adding ways to unexplicitly cast objects is improper: casting is a design issue, a dangerous operation, it should remain consumers responsibility to do it. This proposal here hides a part of it.
