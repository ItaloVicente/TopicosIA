I do like the convenience on IStructuredSelection though I'm no convinced by the changes to ISelection. My gut feeling is that it's a false assumption that the subtypes of ISelection, that are not IStructuredSelection, will want to stream Strings.
Line:30, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ISelection.java -> I second this. The generification of ISelection should not be part of this change set.

Line:48, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ISelection.java -> Should be Stream<? extends Object> instead.

Line:77, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/IStructuredSelection.java -> Not sure if Collections.checkedList does really here since it does not check on #get

Line:81, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/IStructuredSelection.java -> Should probably be Stream<? extends Object>

Patch Set 3 must not be merged (see comments inline)
Line:48, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ISelection.java -> I don't think this does fit in this generic ISelection, as such selection can totally be a single element and stream be an undesired operation for extenders to implement if it doesn't fit the selection meaning.
Also, we should avoid such default methods that return "wrong" values if not implemented: consumers who see that will assume this method is working and will start relying on it. But if the provider of the selection has not implemented it (eg untouched code), then the consumer gets a faulty result and gets an impression the selection doesn't respect the contract.
So this basically can introduce bugs in some existing ISelection implementations. This is not desirable.

@Sebastion: Where do you think it states it will stream String? a selection can stream any Type that seems reasonable including Object.
Line:30, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ISelection.java -> I'll split this once there is general agreement if this change can happen.

Line:48, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/ISelection.java -> If its a single selection then one can simply return a single element. Implementors can still chose to not stream anything if the think its not useful/meaningfull, such selections can the not be used in a generic way without knowing the concrete subtype but that's nothing special as its todays state.
And that's another place of boilerplate, everyone checks for structured selection first, then cast, or even worse write code that do not get the selection from the event because its easier to query the viewer again. Or even more worse, call #getStructuredSelection() that state it will trow exception if its not compatible just for convinience.

I think its not an option to completely rework the jface.selection API so we need to get the best out of it.

This is what I deduced from https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/platform/eclipse.platform.text/+/175249/
So effectively the filtered stream would only ever contain a fixed set of well known types - String in the current draft. Most of the meaningful consumers will need more information, though. In that sense, the added API to ISelection does not help or it doesn't carry its weight.

I feel like we could get the best cost / benefit ration from the changes to IStructuredSelection - altering ISelection is not helping here in my opinion.

The reference is from platform.text, so it seems natural that it is dedicated to text/string :-)
Another implementer of the API I'm aware of is Nebula Grid, where such an implementation would for example stream a list of selected cells.

But the vast majority of use cases would be the Viewer API of JFace where as today one needs the following boilerplate a hundred and thousands of times:

 viewer.addSelectionChangedListener(event -> { 
   ISelection selection = event.getSelection(); // I know there's event.getStructuredSelection()
                                        // but that will possibly throw exception, just another
                                        // workaround/helper method :-\
   if (selection instanceof IStructuredSelection) {
      IStructuredSelection structuredSelection = (IStructuredSelection) selection;
      for (Object object : structuredSelection) {
         if (object instanceof MyObject) {
            MyObject myObject = (MyObject) object;
            // do something with the target object
         }
      }
   }
 });

and now with the proposed API:

 viewer.addSelectionChangedListener(event -> {
    event.getSelection().filteredStream(MyObject.class).forEach(object->{
        // do something with the target object
     });
 });

Transitioning from current code to this one assumes the retrieved ISelection has the method implemented. And this is not right to assume because it's a public API that won't mandate consumers to implement new methods.
In reality, there are some ISelection implements we don't own in Platform and that won't adopt the new APIs. That means that if someone does switch the code as you mentions and as the API proposal now kind of recommends, they'll face a bug because their selection will basically not be processed.
OK, we'd save a few lines of code here and there; but the risk of reducing quality by introducing bugs is higher and more important than saving lines here.
On the other hand, as the proposed default methods can have a correct implemntation for IStructuredSelection (or even StructuredSelection), there is no such risk in here.
Default methods returning wrong/bugged values are to be avoided.

As its today, everyone has to "assume" what objects are there and what kind of selection is there. Still it makes coding much more clean in that cases where one only want to work together with such selections.

> And this is not right to assume because it's a public API that won't mandate consumers to implement new methods.

Its right under the given perquisites. I happily would make these methods not default implemented in which case no one can use it as its an API interface and we can't extend --> it will never be resolved. That's the root-cause why there's no progress in ages in this area since Java 1.4

> In reality, there are some ISelection implements we don't own in Platform and that won't adopt the new APIs.

That jsut means one either needs to check for concrete implementation (as its today) or convince the project to adopt to the new API, so it can only become better...

> OK, we'd save a few lines of code here and there; but the risk of reducing quality by introducing bugs is higher and more important than saving lines here.

And here we are stuck for another 10 years...

I'm open to any suggestion that passes API-Tools / Eclipse progress and user-ranting...

Yes, and they take responsibility over their assumption, the Platform code doesn't misguide them towards using APIs that return faulty values.

Indeed, we cannot just break users like that. It's not something that can change all of a sudden, no arguing can change that. It's deep and has to be discussed generally and not specifically to 1 issue, ideally on the mailing-list.

the "just" (was "jsut") is not at all as small as you think. Platform cannot just break its extenders without a deprecation phase, Platform cannot introduce APIs that will lead to bugs, Platform cannot put extra work on its adopters just because some new API is there and is useful internally. Some projects have been untouched for years and need to keep working for years being untouched.
It's sad, it's difficult, but it's how this Platform has survived for years. When it come to APIs, it's never "just" a small change in Platform, it's a change we mandate many plugins to adopt, and some of them will just miss that and we have to deal with it. If we don't then many plugins will start failing of having bugs, and users rarely make the difference between a plugin and the Platform: if we merge this change and next release has bugs because of some plugins that didn't implement the new methods, the people will say bad thing about the Eclipse IDE and just move away if they're too annoyed.

> And here we are stuck for another 10 years...

Maybe.

> I'm open to any suggestion that passes API-Tools / Eclipse progress and user-ranting...

There is no such change usually. The game is to find the one that will minimize user-ranting.
IMO, if you want to go towards generic, just reopen https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=414057 , or let's get back to patch set 1.

The point is, this does not "break" anything and it does not introduce "magic" bugs nor it is useful "internally" its for the every day developer of any jface/platform related plugin.

There is always a relation between the producer and the consumer of a selection, no one exspects that a component written for X magically wok with Y. And if I'm interfacing "old" code I obivous can't use new APIs, so I either use old APIs or update the code.


> Some projects have been untouched for years and need to keep working for years being untouched.
Nothing will change for them!

> It's sad, it's difficult, but it's how this Platform has survived for years.

So most probably we have to wait until Platform dies? Or wait until everyone has migrate to IntelliJ/... whatever?

I would be really happy if we can laeve the "whythis can't work" battleground and switch over to "how can we make it happen"... referencing bugs that are even harder to archive (no progress for > 5 years) does not help. I don't want to change the big-picture I just want to improve things in small steps that helps right away.

So if your unhappy with default implemented method, make a suggestion what can be used as an alternative here.

OK, no API linkage error at compile-time nor runtime

Yes, it can really introduce magic bugs because this is adding to consumers (whoever) some methods that are not returning correct values unless producer has invested in supporting them. Since we cannot assume that all consumers will check all producers to decide whether to rely on these methods or not, this is a place for consumers to easily face/author new bugs.

> There is always a relation between the producer and the consumer of a selection, no one exspects that a component written for X magically wok with Y.

That's not true. Everyone expects isEmpty for X to return proper value to whichever Y. It's the typical API contract that methods are expected to return proper values to any consumer. It has to remain that way.

> So most probably we have to wait until Platform dies? Or wait until everyone has migrate to IntelliJ/... whatever?

We have to keep doing our the best we can like it has been the case for many years with a decent success.

> I would be really happy if we can laeve the "whythis can't work" battleground and switch over to "how can we make it happen"... referencing bugs that are even harder to archive (no progress for > 5 years) does not help.

Sorry, but we need to fix the issues where they belong, even if it's in 5-years-old-without-progress bugs. Every release, a few bugs that are 10+ years old get fixed, age is no a reason to ignore an issue and go for incorrect solutions instead.
IMO, generifying IStructuredSelection makes much more sense and has much more chances of being successful than generifying ISelection as you suggest.
And I'm sorry if you find we focus on "why this can't work", but it's a key step of the quality enforcement. If there are technical reasons why something is considered as not working or incorrect, then this has to be said and code cannot be merged in.

Now, about "how can we make it happen", I suggest you get back to the initial proposal or -better yet harder- revive the bug about generifying IStructuredSelection and make a proposal there.

> I don't want to change the big-picture I just want to improve things in small steps that helps right away.

Sure, small steps may be welcome; as long as they don't show technical concerns.

> So if your unhappy with default implemented method, make a suggestion what can be used as an alternative here.

Default methods to get a stream in ISelection and anything genericizing ISelection is just plain wrong to me. This is something that would be better in IStructuredSelection, just like toList(), as you suggested in patch set #1. I know I expressed against it, but I would bend to the masses as there is huge interest from others because it's technically correct (low risk of broken API and almost no risk of unexpected behavior for consumers).
But this current patch set #3 doesn't meet the quality criteria to go into the code base.

No code would ever be able to reliably call that method.

Personally I think that adding the new methods to IStructuredSelection is already a step forward. Would it make sense to reduce the scope of this change here to that improvement and move the discussion about ISelection itself to bugzilla again?
