DESCRIPTION:

Bug 494789 - org.eclipse.ui.trim.command2 failing to display on right
side during first startup

An applied similar solution like Bug 528890.

The basic trimbar controls are being created after the extension
contributors are added. So, added in default e4 template to create
earlier than creating programmatically in this method.
org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchWindow.populateTopTrimContributions()

Is this also needed in org.eclipse.platform/LegacyIDE.e4xmi?

Yes, that's the code fix. As per the comment https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=528890#c27, I added for "org.eclipse.ui.workbench/LegacyIDE.e4xmi" also.

I'm sorry I've missed your answer, so too late with my feedback.

Not sure you understand my question above, or not sure I understood your answer.

Let re-starte.

The change *here* is done only in the "workbench" version of LegacyIDE.e4xmi.
There is no such part in the "platform version" yet, and it is also not added in this patch.

So don't we need this change in the "platform version" of of LegacyIDE.e4xmi?
If not - why? If yes - please add.

@Andrey: as far as I know, Lakhsminarayana isn't working on Eclipse related stuff any more. Do you think this patch is worth being merged as it? ie is it an improvement?

I simply have no time to review this. If you can, just try to reproduce the problem and check if the patch fixes that. I believe it will, but as said - no time.
