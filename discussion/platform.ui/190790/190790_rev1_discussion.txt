Simeon, this does not solve the issue entirely, but at least this protects the code from being used in wrong thread / allows jobs to compute the id from non UI thread and pass "prompt" id to later UI execution.

Line:3137, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> Looks like a dirty hack to me.

Also if we "already know" we are supposed to prompt the user, I don't think the code below should ask again the handler about which editor to use.

Line:267, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/LargeFileLimitsPreferenceHandler.java -> I'll check what other code is being called by SourceLookupFacility, I'm guessing I changed the wrong code. There should be a UI thread call somewhere, that leads to opening the editor. Likely we have to change *that* code. Instead of SourceLookupFacility.

From my POV we shouldn't change code here, if the user wants a prompt they should get one *here and now*. We shouldn't transfer some "secret value" through who knows what code (and who knows what is being done with the ID) before it lands at the WorkbenchPage code.
