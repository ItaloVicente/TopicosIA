DESCRIPTION:

Bug 90292: Extension to select how to handle unknown file types

Extension point to plug strategies on how to handle unassociated file
types. The default one would remain the current "System editor", this
page provide 2 alternatives, based on various user opinion reported in
related bugs: "Text editor" and "Ask user via pop-up" (that last one
mimics the "Open With..." behavior.
Another possible strategy, still in the state of an idea and not
contributed here would be something like "Poll a remote
suggestion/discovery service".
The choice between the strategy is managed as a preference, that
RCP providers could set via plugin_customization.ini and/or API; and
that user could set via the File/Editor association preference page.

Last patch set fixes smaller issues (compiler warnings, error reporting problems, javadocs here and there etc) and also makes sure that the list of strategy id's is not randomly sorted but appears always in the same order as defined in the xml.

@Mickael: if you are fine with that, I would merge this then.
