This looks as a dirty hack. I'm not sure if this could be solved more elegant. I'd like to have an opinion by someone who is more deeper in this topic.

Why do you think it is a dirty-hack?

Sorry, should not be offending.

The introduced tag is defined in a different bundle to where it is actually used. Clients of IPresentationEngine might wonder what the expected behavior of 'disabling the listeners' should be and why they might gonna need it.

Would it be possible to add a test case that would trigger the switch?

Just wanted to know the reason behind it so no worries.
I noticed that most (maybe all?) tags of the MinMax addon are defined in the IPresentationEngine (I assume so they could be used in code without reference MinMax directly) but maybe there is a better place for this? 
I also won't mind to define this as a rather rare case and thus better embedd the string inti MinMaxAddon directly (if one want to use it he still can copy the literal, as this is required also in the model editor/e4xmi)

I think I would feel better with that. I'd like to have a second opinion, I'm no expert in that area.

I think this one is too narrow. Better to allow disabling the hole Min-Max addon so that you can write your own custom logic. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=394231#c12

This effectively disables the min-/max on the Container via a tag, should this not satisfy the requirement on the bug?
Maybe someone more familiar with MinMax Addon could provide a more smart way, I'm just not sure if Min/Max could be installed/unistalled on the fly?

If you move the constant to MinMaxAddon, we can release. Addons are optional and we do not want to add to much addon logic into IPresentationEngine.
