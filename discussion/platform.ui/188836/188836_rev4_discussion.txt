DESCRIPTION:

Bug 571844 - made TreeViewer::add idempotent

To prevent duplicate TreeItems, search not only forward but
also backward while trying to find an equal element as the initial
indexInItems will point to the middle element of three equal (equal by
the comparator) elements after binary search.

I am not familiar with this topic. however this looks like a O(n^2) loop. Shouldn't it be a "merge-join"? i.e. would be faster to have both lists sorted O(n log(n)) before merging them - in only one direction?

Yes, that algorithm can be O(m*n*log(n)) in the worst-case. I used 
- m-> element count to be added 
- n -> tree size. 

As an explanation, lets have a look at two scenarios:
- Worst case: The tree contains only elements for which 'comparator.compare(o0, o1)==0 && !o1.equals(o2)' is true:
  - iterates over the elements to insert -> m
  - calculates the index for insertion (binary search) -> log n  
  - walks forwards and backwards from the insertionIndex to search for potential duplicates (the while loop). As all elements compare to each other with '0', all elements are visited -> n

-> The algorithm is =(m*n*log(n)) in the worst case


- Best case: The tree contains only elements for which 'comparator.compare(o0, o1)!=0' is true:
  - iterates over the elements to insert -> m
  - calculates the index for insertion (binary search) -> log n  
  - walks forwards and backwards from the insertionIndex to search for potential duplicates. The while loop does only two steps in all cases, as all elements compare to each other with '1' or '-1". -> No effect for the O() calculation.

-> The algorithm is O(m log n) in the best (and the more realistic) case.

Both lists are already sorted at this point, but I do not see how this helps to to build the add algorithm in O(n log n) as we we need a duplication detection (only possible in O(n) for the worst case) and the insertion itself is already implemented in O(m log n).

ok, i understood that now. thanks for explaining. 
I wonder why AbstractTreeViewer.add() does not describe that equal Elements are not inserted but updated. Also is see in the javadoc of AbstractTreeViewer: "As of 3.2, AbstractTreeViewer supports multiple equal elements" which contradicts skipping equal elements. I don't know what is supposed to happen but the javadoc seems to be wrong at some place
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> AbstractTreeViewer

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> wording: Updating a node is not really "idempotent".

That's a good point. I think the javadoc of the AbstractTreeViewer.add()/AbstractTreeViewer.createAddedElements() should mention that 'refresh only' behaviour.

This is only a contradiction at first glance: The java doc describes that the AbstractTreeViewer supports multiple equal elements with !different! parent chains. There is no contradiction to the duplicate detection in this code, as the duplicates are only searched within the items[] containing all Items with the same parent:
 Item[] items = getChildren(widget);

items[] does not contain all objects shown in the whole tree.
