DESCRIPTION:

Bug 571844 - made TreeViewer::add idempotent

To prevent duplicate TreeItems, search not only forward but
also backward while trying to find an equal element as the initial
indexInItems will point to the middle element of three equal (equal by
the comparator) elements after binary search.

Line:400, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/AbstractTreeViewer.java -> this seem to ne copy from the block below, but without comments. I would add them back and make it more clear that two blocks are identical except search direction.

I wonder if they could be refactored to a method?

Line:307, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/AbstractTreeViewerTest.java -> just wondering if one also should check with child2 and child3. Your change could invert the bug :)

Line:30, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/TestElement.java -> why this? So there will be no equal elements allowed in the set? why it is needed? 
This is not clear and must be explained in code

A method is not possible without making the code realy complex as the while loops produce multiple results:
  - insertIndexInItems is used after the while loop
  - continue elementloop references loop outside the mentioned code

I refactored the code to reduce it to a single while loop which changes the direction internally. I think the resulting code is more readable than the initial version.

Line:307, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/AbstractTreeViewerTest.java -> That's a good hint, I added the checks with child2 and child3

Line:30, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers/TestElement.java -> The idea was that we don't allow duplicates in our model used as input for the viewer but i decided to revert this change as it is not necessary for the added test/fixed bug.
In addition the nobody ensures that the input of a TreeViewer has no duplicates in real life, so this change was factually wrong.
