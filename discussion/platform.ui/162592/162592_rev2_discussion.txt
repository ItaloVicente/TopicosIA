DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 562892 - Calling toBeRendered on a view toolbar breaks UI

Not sure if the all changes are done at the correct place, this might break custom renderers.
The toolbars in the stack should be created lazily too.
There is still an issue with isVisible, when it is toggled and the toolbar is wrapped, the toolbar is drawn over the other widgets. Toggeling toBeRenderd seems to work fine.

The part is null if called by PerspectiveStackRenderer
Line:457, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> This should also mention the toolbar after this change.

Line:472, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> While we are here, I suggest to add brackets to the if statement

Line:475, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> I know this is an existing name but I suggest to rename this variable to part to make it easier to read the following code.

Line:476, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Why do we need other variable? Looks to me that we can already use element (or part if you agree with the variable rename)

Line:477, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> IIRC I have seen this weird "try to get parent for part or placeholder" logic in multiple places. Maybe the following is easier to read?

if (element.getCurSharedRef() != null) {
			parentElement = element.getCurSharedRef().getParent();
		} else {
			parentElement = element.getParent();
		}
if (parentElement == null) {
			return;
		}
Maybe we should add a method to get the parent for a part (or placeholder) to the EModelService. Rolf, WDYT?

Line:492, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Looks to me that we also want to leave if the parentElement is not a MPartStack.

if (parentElement == null || !(parentElement instanceof MPartStack)) {
			return;
		}

Line:812, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Unrelated to this change, but I don't understand why this is needed. Would that not move the view menu below all other widgets and hence make it invisible if other widgets are present?

Line:849, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Unrelated to this change but we call pack again in line 857 so I believe this is unnecessary

I think the logic should be changed, patch change will follow soon.

In general, I think that the PartRenderingEngine takes too much responsibilities of the different renderers. If the engine did not trigger rendering on the original model, it should also not respond to changes in the model on items it did not trigger on. (like changing rendering, visibility, and removing gui.) But this would be context of another bug.
Line:457, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Done; Changed the description to the real behavior (changes in sub-items are not considered. Maybe they should be too..

Line:475, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> I did not rename. With the old current name the following remarks can be fixed easier.

Line:476, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Done

Line:477, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Done

Line:492, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Done

Line:812, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Apparently that does not happen (maybe it does when having a toolbar in which all items become invisible). Somehow it ensures that this is the last element in the toolbar which is kind of very important to this implementation.
Personally I wonder why the view menu is not on the Toolbar directly, that would require less of this kind of magic.

Line:849, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Done
