DESCRIPTION:

Bug 562892 - Calling toBeRendered on a view toolbar breaks UI

Giving full control to the StackRenderer over the appearance of the toolbar on stacks. This allows to StackRendere to prevent toolbars to pop up for parts that are not on top. And request proper layout.
Furthermore, not use the model to hide toolbars that are not top, but directly put them on the limbo shell.

Is there any design documentation on the E4 model, besides the (outdated) wiki pages? See my issue below.
Line:777, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> Now I really wonder if we should be using the setVisible method here, or move it manually to the limbo shell. What is the design philosophy for the E4 model here?

The setVisible might be the intended use [1], i.e. the toolbar is not visible if the part is not on top. Maybe we should just flip back the visibility if somebody manually tries to change it (like me while testing this features).

AFAIK the limbo shell was used as workaround as some model elements could not made invisible. So if visible works, we should use that.
This is a bit of guessing as I was also not present during the design discussions (this was before me active time).
Line:459, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/StackRenderer.java -> " the view menu" looks like a copy / paste error

Rolf, can you update this one? AFAICS this is "almost" done.

Depends on how you define "almost", or how ugly the solution can be to get a (somewhat) working behavior.

The current version of the patch does not use setVisible on the Toolbar when switching tabs. If I am correct, it was intended that this visibility was used to hide non visible elements in the model. So in that sense, this solution is incorrect.

Then thinks get complicated and ugly. The responsibilities between PartRenderingEngine and its Renderers is not well defined. Creation of gui child elements that are not part of the childer feature, is orchastrated from the renderers, while destruction of the gui is orchestrated by the engine. And when visibility/isRendered is toggled, the engine unconditionally kicks in, randomly throwing widgets on the screen.

In the StackRenderer it is not clear who is responsible for showing/hiding toolbars when switching tabs, it is now coded in the adjustTopRight method but that is also called when toggling visible/toBeRendered.

I will probably open a bug to rethink the responsibilities between the Engine and the different Renderers.

w.r.t this patch, what would be acceptable? The current patch bypassing the visible setting, or some layout issues when a toolbar is set visible for a part that is not on top?

I think so too.

IMHO we should try to move to use the visibility property more which feels like the desired solution.
