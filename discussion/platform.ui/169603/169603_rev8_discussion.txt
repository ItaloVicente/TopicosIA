I have implemented a propagation mechanism for exceptions thrown by the suppliers. See the comment below, though.
Line:212, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> I have to think about whether it is wise to re-throw exceptions like this. Maybe it would be better to always wrap them. The problem is that it is not visible to users that the exceptions where caught and re-thrown, which is probably confusing.

Related example: Future#get throws ExecutionException instead of re-throwing exceptions.

Line:212, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> Future#get is mostly constrained by the Callable<> interface that throws Exception. As a user, I really don't care about the internal of wheter the function was executed syncronous (I get "real exception" or asyncronous (I get a somehow wrapped one...).

Line:212, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> Hm. I think users do care about this. Or rather, that the extra information in a wrapping exception is useful for understanding what's going on.

When you try to understand why you got some exception you will look at the stack trace and wonder why neither the current method nor execAndGet is present there.

I'm leaning towards the solution where we wrap everything in RuntimeException.

Line:212, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> This simply forces one to use a lot of boilerplate code for no gain.

Just a simple example:

If a Method can trow a "NumberFormatException" and I catch this to handle this case, I don't want to get a generic runtime exception just because it was executed asyncronous, to acompany for this I have to catch the exception and examine the cause (or cause of cause of... because its wrapped somewhere else again)...

Thats what I originally had in mind with the ticket was that the caller do not need to know that the realm might execute async.

Line:212, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> Well, I agree with the "a lot of boilerplate" part, but not the "no gain" part. Often issues have multiple sides to them. Maybe the annoying boilerplate for some cases is something we have to live with to avoid more important problems.

If exceptions are simply re-thrown then in a lot of cases there is no entry in the stack trace about where the call to `execAndGet` actually happened. (Only lambdas that are created directly as arguments leave an entry in the stack trace for the right position. (For the ECJ at least.))

Often those stack traces will end up in a log and someone will have to figure out what has happened after the fact. In those cases it is very unfortunate if there is no way to find out where `execAndGet` was called.

I think the best solution in cases where an exception is expected, as in your NumberFormatException example, is to catch the exception in the supplier and then return something appropriate, like an Optional.

Sometimes we have to sacrifice some convenience when developing to have more convenience when debugging.

Line:212, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> If you think we should go this way IMO then not Supplier<T> but Callable<T> should be used with the exceptions thrown by Future<>#get  InterruptedException, ExecutionException, this would then be compatible to a change I recently proposed for UISynchronize here https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=563459

@Jens: I'm not sure how the status is here, should we try to get this done e.g. as suggested using Callable and simply bubble up executionExceptions/Interuption as a first step?)

Hello again,

I've been having the flu and have not been able to think about this for a while. Maybe in a short while I can spend some time on it again.

This turned out to be much more complicated then I anticipated when exceptions where taken into account... I just wanted to make a simple and lightweight convenience method...

It seems very intrusive to me to use ExecutionExceptions here since they are checked. I'm leaning towards using RuntimeException.

It would be better with a more specific exception of course. But there doesn't seem to be a suitable one available in the standard library, and it seems excessive to define a special purpose exception type just for this.

Hi Jens, I hope your getting better now.

I have played around with different alternatives and it seems the following seems the most appropriate one adding a method to Realm of the following kind

	public <T> CompletableFuture<T> call(Callable<T> function) {

		CompletableFuture<T> future = new CompletableFuture<>();
		if (isCurrent()) {
			try {
				future.complete(function.call());
			} catch (Exception e) {
				future.completeExceptionally(e);
			}
		}
		asyncExec(new Runnable() {

			@Override
			public void run() {

				try {
					future.complete(function.call());
				} catch (Exception e) {
					future.completeExceptionally(e);
				}
			}
		});
		return future;
	}

What do you think?

Hi, Christoph!

> What do you think?

After only a quick look this seems like a great solution to me! It is much simpler than the previous alternative, and gives clients more power too, by using components from the standard library. 

Unfortunately I don't have the time or energy to help with review during this period. So you'll have to find other committer for that. Maybe you

WIP for more than a year. This is cleaning platform.ui clean before migration to Github. Please open PR if/when you finish the change and migration is complete.
