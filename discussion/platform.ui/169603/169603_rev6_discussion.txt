Find some comment below.
Line:197, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> What about simply name the method "exec" then?

Line:200, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> I think we should call the supplier here directly to not imlpy additional overhead and have proper exception handling.

Line:202, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> We should check here first if the supplier is != null

Line:221, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> I don't think it is a good idea to log exceptions here as the caller will then get a null result and might has the follwoing problems:
- null might be an illegal return value for this method and the caller won't be aware to get null values
- null might be a valid value and the caller might assume a "succesfull" call and proceeds

This problem also arises for the other (sync)exec methods (just another quirk of the current implementation) so people are forced to wrap everything in SafeRunnables if the like proper exception handling...

I think the exception should be recored and then rethrown if it is a RTE and wrapped otherwhise in a RTE and thrown otherwise.

Thanks for the suggestions Christoph. I really hadn't thought the exception handling through enough.

I will implement a mechanism for propagating exceptions to the caller instead of relying on ISafeRunnable.
Line:197, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> I don't want to name the method `exec` because there is already a method named `exec`, and method overloading is a tricky thing. Especially in a context where lambdas will be used to to determine which overload that will be used.

My rule of thumb regarding method overloading is this: Only use it when the overloads do exactly the same thing, except some simple type conversion.

Line:200, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> Yes, you're right, I missed the fact that we need proper exception handling for this method, see more below.

Line:202, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> You're right, thanks, done.

Line:221, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> Right, good observation, thanks. I didn't think about the return value after an exception is thrown by the supplier. I should have had a unit test for that!

I think you're right, the exception should be recorded and rethrown. Even if this problem arise also for the other exec methods it is particularly sever for this method because the purpose of this method is to return a value. 

But we don't have to worry about non-RTEs, right? Because Supplier does not declare that it throws any such exceptions.

Line:221, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/Realm.java -> Yes RTE should be enough, but you probably will get to a point where it is not clear that only RTE are thrown in the sync Exec case...
