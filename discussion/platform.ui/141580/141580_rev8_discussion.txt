DESCRIPTION:

Check for nulls in converter constructors

Add guards to check numberFormat and type arguments to constructors
for null. This prevents failures with NPE later when the field is
used.

I added checks for the other constructor arguments also. I would be a bit weird to only check one of them.

On a second though...

These classes are non-final. There might have sub-classes out there that handles the case when `numberFormat` is null. Such sub-classes would break with this change.

Given that fact, and also the fact that this change only brings a sight improvement in the common case, I think it is best not to merge this change.

This is theoretically, but how is the chance? Why should you subclass here? Please take in mind:
1) The constructors are private. Instances can only be created using the factory methods.
2) Subclasses won't be able to access the private constructor
3) Subclasses would have to to deal with null numberFormat by overriding the convert() method

From what I read I don't think null numberFormat is a real use case "out there".

Oh yes, you're right! I didn't think about that!

In that case there is no real risk of breaking any code.

I'll merge.
