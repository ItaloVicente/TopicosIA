DESCRIPTION:

Bug 492252 - Ensure JobInfo are created with FinishedJobs instance

JobInfo instances were created with a null reference for FinishedJobs in
JobInfoFactory. This change makes the FinishedJobs reference in
ProgressManager non optional, and the JobInfoFactory takes the
ProgressManager's FinishedJobs instance for creation of JobInfos.

This required that FinishedJobs does not require a ProgressManager for
its construction. This was needed to register an
IJobProgressManagerListener to the ProgressManager. The FinishedJobs
class now directly implements the listener interface, and
ProgressManager can now register the FinishedJobs it gets as listener.
This resolves the circular dependency between both classes.
