DESCRIPTION:

Bug 563121 - StringMatcher / SearchPattern /
FilteredItemsSelectionDialog behave differently since removal of icu

Stop using BreakIterator at all. According to comment it's been
introduced for J2ME compatibility and it's just string.split("\\w")

Sorry, not really, since I have no clue why this word-splitting was introduced in the first place, or what the expected behavior should be.

One problem with \W that might occur is that it is defined as [^\w], and \w is [a-zA-Z_0-9]. So this might split strangely for non-ASCII text?

BreakIterator has locale-dependent word rules. Perhaps splitting on Unicode whitespace might be more appropriate: (\h|\v)+ . Or just simple whitespace \s+ , as for the pattern?

The BreakIterator was introduced in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/122869/ . No idea where the code for getWords() came from; the comment mentioning \W appears to be wrong: previous versions of this class didn't use that. Copied from somewhere? Perhaps Mickael can give some more insights.

Mickael, would you please give some clue here? Also is there good test suite we can use for validation?

The referenced bug 90579 has to do with no results being shown for some Unicode input via IME (DBCS = double byte character set). Bug 90579 comment 12 already pointed out that \W probably would be wrong.

See also the screenshot attached there: text to be searched is Japanese.

Given that background I would suggest to split on Unicode whitespace. (Or can \b help?)

Or perhaps

  Pattern nonWord = Pattern.compile("\\W+", Pattern.UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS);
  String[] words = nonWord.split(text, 0);

But as I said originally, I don't know what the exact requirements are here. (Also don't know what Unicode \W+ would do with combining characters.)

I can't really help with this code, but the most relevant testSuite (that we used with Lucas when tweaking that) was PatternFilterTest IIRC.
I don't know how good are those tests that said. As far as I can see, they don't cover encoding, which may be a problematic corner case.

In that case I'd say the best bet is the Unicode \W Pattern.compile("\\W+", Pattern.UNICODE_CHARACTER_CLASS);. I'd go with that.

The PatternFilterTest looks *very* basic.

Alexander, could you add at least the test case mentioned in the bug report (foobar_123 etc.) somewhere, please?

A few tests with German Umlauts, French accents, or Cyrillic script would be good, too, but the word splitting rules are about the same as in English (punctuation and whitespace) AFAIK, so this won't really test the corner cases.

Of course, if there's a Chinese, Arabic, Japanese or Korean speaker at RedHat or IBM who could help do at least a few basic tests for some of those languages, that'd be even better.

There's also bug 563123 which seems to have the same root cause.
