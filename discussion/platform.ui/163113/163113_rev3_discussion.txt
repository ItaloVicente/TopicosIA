DESCRIPTION:

Bug 563121 - StringMatcher / SearchPattern /
FilteredItemsSelectionDialog behave differently since removal of icu

Stop using BreakIterator at all. According to comment it's been
introduced for J2ME compatibility and it's just regex split "\\w".

I didn't manage to add any meaningful test to PatternFilterTest. Its behavior is more complicated than StringMatcher

So it's time to have a dedicated StringMatcherTest with unit tests for this class.

Apparently the idea is that I can enter several patterns, separated by whitespace, and then either: the whole thing matches the whole text, or the whole thing matches a single word from the text, or all of the individual patterns match on a word of the text. 

Should be possible to write at least a few tests for this? Certainly the ones from the bug report. A test that should fail if \W is the plain ASCII version is

  assertTrue(new StringMatcher("huhn h?hner", false, false).match("hahn henne hühner küken huhn"));

(succeeds with the Unicode \W, and also with the BreakIterator).
Line:488, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/misc/StringMatcher.java -> Why compile every time? nonWord could be private static final.
