DESCRIPTION:

Bug 563121 - StringMatcher / SearchPattern /
FilteredItemsSelectionDialog behave differently since removal of icu

Stop using BreakIterator at all. According to comment it's been
introduced for J2ME compatibility and it's just regex split "\\w".
Not optimal to have the StringMatcher test sneaked into
PatternFilterTest but having dedicated test class would be confusing as
we have many StringMatcher classes and unfortunately tests don't follow
any package structure to match the code.
