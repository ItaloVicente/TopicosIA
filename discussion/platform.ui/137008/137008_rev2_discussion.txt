DESCRIPTION:

Bug 544493 - Simplify ProgressIndicator implementation

ProgressIndicator currently creates two ProgressBar and a StackLayout to
manage if it shows infinite or deterministic progress.

As a ProgressIndicator can either show infinit or finit progress we can
avoid unnecessary object creation by just managing one ProgressBar.

Julian, can you review this one? Patchset 1 contains some check code to ensure that only finite or infinite is used.

Any idea why it had been implemented that way? Aside from maybe performance, I don't see any reason to maintain two progress bars.
Line:38, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/ProgressIndicator.java -> can be final

Line:83, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/ProgressIndicator.java -> Could this cause a performance issue with misbehaved code that calls beginTask frequently? To be safe, you could check if the current progressBar has the correct style and omit the recreation & requestLayout completely.

Line:99, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/ProgressIndicator.java -> Is it correct that the progress bar disappears on done()? Did layout.topControl = null affect the same?

Line:140, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/ProgressIndicator.java -> Any access of progressBar before begin*() and after done() will now fail. Something like showError(); beginTask(x); would have worked before.

To restore the previous behavior, you would have to memorize the state when disposed and apply it after creation. worked() calls could be ignored since begin() starts from zero anyway.

no I don't know. Maybe it was considered as easier?
Line:38, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/ProgressIndicator.java -> Done

Line:83, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/ProgressIndicator.java -> style cannot change AFAICS. But I add a check for null and dispose;

Line:99, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/ProgressIndicator.java -> I think it is the correct behaviour.

Line:140, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/ProgressIndicator.java -> With the upcoming patchset the ProgressBar is not disposed anymore at done.
