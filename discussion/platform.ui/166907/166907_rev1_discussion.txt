Would you mind if we set it to a lighter colour?
Line:20, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_default_mac.css -> I found when both colours were set to D6D6D6 that it was a bit too dark and didn't fit in well with the colour scheme as it was. However, setting both colours to F6F6F6 removes the gradient and ends up with a lighter colour, which I think works better as the current settings.

Generally there are some colour improvements we could make to a number of places to bring it more in line with macOS stule, but I can probably tackle that as a separate bug.

Alex, please update the Gerrit directly. AFAIK Andrew has no Mac system to test.

That's totally fine with me - Lars is correct, I don't have a Mac so I don't have too strong of an opinion on using a ligher color (looking at the picture you posted on BZ, I agree a lighter color would probably look best).

WRT improving the styling to fit macOS style, I would recommend checking Bug 565556

I can update this before we merge it as it seems to make things worst looking based on the screenshot you posted.
Line:20, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_default_mac.css -> I noticed a new gradient appeared in the picture you posted (using the darker D6D6D6). I'm ok with updating this to F6F6F6 before this gets merged, as it'll probably look a lot better.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hi Aleks, currently I think this should probably be abandoned, though if I get the time I'll update it as Alex had requested. 

Alex, if you have the time feel free to submit an updated patch with the correct color F6F6F6
