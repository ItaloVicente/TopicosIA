DESCRIPTION:

Bug 511802 - Using requestLayout in SashLayout

SWT Windows requires currently a synchronous layout call to update its
user interface. Linux renders fine and Mac also (needs to be retested
with latest patch).

Note:
The updateLayoutInProgress variable was removed, as the layout
call is synchronous, IMHO we cannot have two layout calls at the same
time.
Also the instanceOf check was removed, as it was not necessary, layout
is defined on Composite

I think the layout call be necessary but not sure about layoutUpdateInProgress flag.

I re-tested with Patchset 8. Works fine on macOS. I don't see a difference to how it worked before this change.

I changed the Windows part to be exact as before. This code is in an astonishing equilibrium where any apparently trivial change made things worse.

Good for Mac. Thanks for testing. I did not changed the code run on Mac so no need for retesting.

It is even not so much the layout call. Because of still known reasons any other combination as the current brings significant rendering problems to Windows. (which makes searching the root cause even more interesting)
You are probably right on the no layout while layout part (I wouldn't bet on it; surprising things can happen while layouting). But the adjustWeights triggers the subscribeTopicSashWeightChanged which triggers the forcedLayout so the flag is necessary for now.
I would not try to change this for now. Give me some time to search for the root bug on Windows. Commonly while fixing one complex bug I find and fix some other related bugs on my way.
