DESCRIPTION:

Bug 511802 - Using requestLayout in SashLayout

SWT Windows requires currently a synchronous layout call to update its
user interface. Linux renders fine and Mac also (needs to be retested
with latest patch).

Not sure if sync layout call is also needed on Windows. Needs to be
tested. The updateLayoutInProgress should not be helpful, as the layout
call is synchronous, IMHO we cannot have two layout calls at the same
time.

I wouldn't go so far and say this flag make sense. But it is indeed still necessary on Windows.
With layoutUpdateInProgress: https://ppazderski.de/stuff/sash-resize-before.gif
Without flag: https://ppazderski.de/stuff/sash-resize-after.gif
See especially the right 'not moving' part.
