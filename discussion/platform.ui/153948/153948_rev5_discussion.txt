Thanks Rolf, impressive how vested you are with our open bugs, I remembered that Stefan worked on it in the past but I did not find this bug. 

One workaround would be to do the force layout only on Windows if only windows SWT is broken.

Matthias, can you test this patch on Mac and see if it still renders correctly?

Pull in the patch and resize the sash in different directions. If it works like on Linux, you should not see cheese. See the video in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=511802 for what I mean by cheese.

Tested on macOS. I don't see "cheese". Moving the sash looks fine. Also moving around parts still works.

SashLayout still contains the host.update() to wait for painting which is now done before layouting. Should be removed and retested.
On Windows it will not work regardless of this update() call.
On Linux it should work because of bug 354762. Afair I tested this variant.
On Mac I'm interested in the result. It might flicker when the update() is removed and in this case it could help to add this update in Display.runDeferredLayouts as in GTK implementation.

PS: -1 is also for the not yet added platform distinction.

Will do.

 Do we already have a open bug for the bug in SWT windows?

+1 for the -1 ;-)

Works fine on Linux, I added a screencast to the bug.

> On Windows it will not work regardless of this update() call.

Lets me know if the change in SashRenderer is also required and if the layoutUpdateInProgress makes sense to you. I don't see how this could happen as the layout call is blocking and IMHO cannot be at the same time.

Works also for me.

@Matthias, can you please retest with the latest patchset?
