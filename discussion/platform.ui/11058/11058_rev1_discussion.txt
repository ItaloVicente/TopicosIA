Just because I am curious:

I certainly understand the changes to the templates and xmlns in the genmodel.  I have also read through bug 400729 & bug 400847.  However, I do not understand the reason/need to make the additional changes to the genmodel.

Could someone point me in the right direction?

Also, if we are making changes to the genmodel, shouldn't there be more changes to the generated class files?  The only changes I noticed were the changes to the javadoc's (and those were because of the changes in the ecore models).

I should also note, I did see the above message about changes being only to javadoc's.  I am really just trying to understand the other changes to the genmodel.
