DESCRIPTION:

Bug 553022 - Optimize getCSSPropertyHandlers for results of size 0 and 1

The CSS Engine calls getCSSPropertyHandlers for each element and style
property during application of theme styles. The resulting collection is
normally empty or has one property handler. The method created an
ArrayList for each call, which is wasting resources.

With this change an empty list is used as long as no handler has to be
returned. When the first handler is added a singleton list is returned.
These singleton lists are cached as the amount of property handlers is
limited.

When a second handler is added, an ArrayList is instantiated and this
and further handlers added to it.

As a result, invocations of this method won't produce garbage.
