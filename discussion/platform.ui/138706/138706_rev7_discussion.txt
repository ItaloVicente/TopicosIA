I share your doubts, and would think that it would be valid to query the preference service with a collection of scopes. Unfortunately this does not behave as expected, see 
  https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=545431

I tried to look at other code samples, and they mostly do the same pattern as I used here.

I agree that this looks overly complicated and there seems a need to simplify this. Maybe you could provide feedback on the mentioned bug ticket?
