DESCRIPTION:

Bug 560027 - Copy/Paste during inline-rename in Project Explorer doesn't
work

Reintegrate TextActionHandler in the standard rename action to ensure
common actions like copy/paste are redirected to the text control while
inline rename is active.

Works great in a few quick tests. One thing that has worried me ever since I first saw TextActionHandler when I looked at this in the past is the lifecycle of that class. The globally registered textXxxActions are never unregistered, even when this thing is disposed. Maybe that's the way it should be, but it sure looks strange.
Line:37, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/RefactorActionGroup.java -> This was true for the old ResourceNavigator. But here it's wrong.

Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/RefactorActionGroup.java -> Presumably you should you override dispose() to also dispose the textActionHandler?

Line:81, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/RefactorActionGroup.java -> Trailing whitespace

The globally registered textXxxActions are never unregistered, even when this thing is disposed. Maybe that's the way it should be, but it sure looks strange.

From what I saw those global actions replace each other and are updated quite often. And while I agree that the lifecycle is a bit strange this particular dispose is also rather harmless. The class won't start throwing errors if used after.
Line:37, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/RefactorActionGroup.java -> Yes. Saw it as well but later forgot about it. Thanks for the reminder.

Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/RefactorActionGroup.java -> I saw no dispose in the old one. Actually I was wondering why it is a field at all in the old one.

Will add tomorrow.
