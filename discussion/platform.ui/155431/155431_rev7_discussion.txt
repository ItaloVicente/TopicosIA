Yes, that's the same problem.

I wish you could ask first before merging this...
Line:5, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.ide/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> ?

This will most likely fail our build, because maven doesn't like to use bundles with lower bundle versions, it will use already published (old) bundles with higher version.

Line:5, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> You can't decrease bundle versions as you like, it is always a pain to get a build after that working.

@Andrey, sorry for not involving you to this review.
This new bundle and related changes was all introduced between 2019-12 GA and 2020-03 M1 - so it looks safe to decrease it back to the stream values.
As you can see from the log, I did several attempt to normalize bundle version until the build converged.
Please reopen the Bug if something
Line:5, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.ide/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This bundle was not published before, it was introduced in this cycle

Line:5, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This version value was introduced in this cycle, the check fails if I increment it to 3.17

Not need to sorry, just wished you would ask on the bug first. You do not need to involve me in particular. 

Current M1 cycle is really stressing and every "possible breaking" change doesn't decrease stress level :-(

I believe as soon as one of I-Builds is there, we have (internal) problem to get maven working properly. We will see.

For sure, I never leave this opportunity :-)

Seriously: please check next build *binaries content* (if the build succeeds) if it has the expected bundle versions.

Decreasing the version is a no go. MUST FIX.

@Dani, is this just for people that used I-Builds to update their SDK installation? 

I remember we could declare some I-Builds that exposed "too high" bundle versions to "unstable" so that they are removed from update sites?

Can't we do this now, or is this too much / too late?

For information: the bundle version increase was made visible with I20191223-1800.

@Alexander: can you please prepare the patch with bundle version reverted back to "highest" version we had? I assume you will need to make API tooling happy too.

Yes, but that's what I suggest to every developer ;-)

This only helps those who did not yet update.

I think everyone should understand that decreasing a version is BAD. So, this should be fixed.

AFAICS 3.15 was the hightest number for the new plugin Created https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/155491/

API tools are still broken for me locally, so I rely on Gerrit validation for that. Andrey/ Alexander feel free to fetch the change and add API filters if necessary

No filters. Version MUST NOT DECREASE!

Sure. The filter is needed to mute API check that says there is no reason to *increase* version, since no API changes were made.

See https://git.eclipse.org/r/155491
