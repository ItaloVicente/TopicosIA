Ok, good thing you added a test.
I wasn't clear about my feeling about test: they are always good, but when implemented *after* a change without a clear regression case or assistance to design, they're actually less profitable that feature work itself. On the other hand, when tackling a regression and helping to design/specify a new feature, tests are often more profitable than the fix themselves. Hence why I personally wouldn't make case a blocker in the case.
But of course, they're still more than welcome!
My +1 is even more valid.
@Kris: please vote +1 when you're fine with a merge here.
