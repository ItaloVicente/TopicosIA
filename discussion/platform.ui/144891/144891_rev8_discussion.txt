I guess it's all good, I'll merge it when build is OK. Worst case we'll revert.

Thanks guys, for taking this, adding the test etc. Sorry for not responding yesterday, I was occupied with something unrelated and I find that gerrit really isn't that good at communicating what/when something's going on. So it's a bit too much of a distraction to try and sort through the cluttered list of comments and changesets when I've got something more urgent to deal with.

Needless to say that I am of course fine with you folks adding a test case and an example, in fact, I am thankful that you are saving me the hassles of doing it myself.
