Kris, next time please add the change-id which is the key in Gerrit to update a change. If you use the staging view in Eclipse we have a button to add this (green one).

@Mickael I don't want to steal your review but maybe it safe you some time if I wrote down what I saw from a brief look.

@Kris Please use API tools (https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform/How_to_Contribute#.5B4.5D_Prepare_API_tooling) and add 4.12 release as baseline. You need to add @since tags on your new API methods.
Line:122, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/preference/StringFieldEditor.java -> still to much copy&paste comment ;)

Line:131, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/preference/StringFieldEditor.java -> I would prefer to reuse constructor code by either replacing this or the next constructor with this(...)

Don't worry, code, reviews, projects, all that is common good, so you're not stealing anything ;) I'm glad you jump in.

Another request for Kris. There is a test preference page [1] for the various field editors. Would be nice to add a multiline example field.

Line:129, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/preference/StringFieldEditor.java -> By the way, couldn't/shouldn't we clarify the width/height terms here and replace by columnCount and lineCount?

Line:157, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/preference/StringFieldEditor.java -> I suggest you invoke `this(name, labelText, wight, 1, strategy, parent)` here.

I didn't think there was a change id yet since, this was the first commit that is creating the change. I'll include it in follow-up commits.
Line:122, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/preference/StringFieldEditor.java -> Are you referring to the copied javadoc? I don't see how this can be avoided. The constructors are very similar after all, and so you'd expect the doc to be very similar as well.

Line:129, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/preference/StringFieldEditor.java -> Sure, but I was merely following a 'trend' that was established in the existing constructor.

Line:131, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/preference/StringFieldEditor.java -> Done

Line:157, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/preference/StringFieldEditor.java -> Done

If you modify and amend your commit and then push it again to gerrit it will create a new change instead of updating this one if you not include the correct change-id in the commit message. 
It is usually more comfortable to let egit add a change-id directly instead of copying the auto generated id back in case you need to update your change.
Line:122, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/preference/StringFieldEditor.java -> Sorry if it was too misunderstanding. I assumed you copy&pasted the width comment and then removed the "or UNLIMIED..." part. But you missed to change the width to height. Similar doc for similar things is no problem.
