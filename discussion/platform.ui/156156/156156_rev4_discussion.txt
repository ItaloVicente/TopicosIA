DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 552909: create a separate, clean MessageDialog type

The existing one has a lot of static methods and already two
constructors with a lot of parameters. Creating a builder in a separate
type would also need changes on MessageDialog. Which would make the API
worse.

The PlainMessageDialog is just copy of MessageDialog but with a much
cleaner API. Just single setter methods for every property.

Also contains the builder with an example for SWT.ERROR

This is work in progress.

I suggest to add a snippet to this Gerrit that will demonstrate the benefits of new API.

My general concern is the number of setters. Setter means the field value may be changed several times during object lifecycle. Is that true? If not - let's pack all that parameters to a separate object (say, "final class Appearance") and pass it to contructor.

We can go further and say that all that "fields" (images, messages, whatever else) are provided by the corresponding Suppliers, that will return "always the same object" in the trivial case but may contain logic of any complexity implemented by client + will allow lazy calculations where possible.
Line:142, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/PlainMessageDialog.java -> Why not to do that inside `createCustomArea` method?
