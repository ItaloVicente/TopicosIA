DESCRIPTION:

Bug 552909: create a separate, clean MessageDialog type

The existing one has a lot of static methods and already two
constructors with a lot of parameters. Creating a build in a separate
type would also need changes on MessageDialog. Which would make the API
worse.

The PlainMessageDialog is just copy of MessageDialog but with a much
cleaner API. Just single setter methods for every property.

This commit is kind of preparation commit for the actual builder.

We should try to find a shorter / better name. FeedbackDialog? UserFeedbackDialog?

Line:346, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/dialogs/PlainMessageDialog.java -> Can we get rid of the generated button labels? I think it is better to simply allow the user to set the labels without questionables defaults.

What will protect it from "contamination" in the nearest future?
The "clean" from OOP perspective means 
 - immutable
 - either abstract or final class 
 - wihtout any "static" keyword inside
 - with clear contract (not just a data structure)

Sure. This is just uploaded work in progress. I'd like to finish the API first and then take care about the things you mentioned.

No, unfortunately not. I'm completely lost in the question into which direction we want to go.
What should the "new" MessageDialog provide as an API. How many logic should be in the new MessageDialog and how many in the Builder.

Some of these concerns are mentioned in the Bug. Please read on from https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=552909#c13. From my point of view it needs some design discussion first.
