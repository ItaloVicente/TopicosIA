DESCRIPTION:

Bug 562174 - [WIP] Allow plugin fragments to supply alternate icons

Allow plugin fragments to contribute alternate icons that will be loaded
through the URLImageDescriptor class.

The icons must be placed within a directory titled "theme"
located at the root of the plugin fragment, ie. "/theme/"

The file path of the replacement icons must match the file path of the
icon
to be replaced.

For example, in order to replace an icon used by plugin org.eclipse.xxx
where the path of the icon is "/path/To/icon.png" in the plugin's bundle
one must:
- Create a plugin fragment with org.eclipse.xxx as the Host Plug-in
- Create a directory "/theme/" at the root of the plugin
fragment
- Place an alternate icon with the correct file path in the theme
directory, ie. "/theme/path/To/icon.png"

I've made the requested changes and also made it so that the alternate/themed image is only looked up after checking for zoomed images. Previously, themed images were taking priority over zoomed images which is incorrect IMO.

If any help is needed with testing, I can provide instructions on how to setup an examplary plugin fragment that replaces icons, or include it in the gerrit temporarily.
Line:235, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> I've temporarily commented this line out for testing purposes, as I'm not sure yet how to set this JFaceResource/Preference

Line:254, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> In my testing, $nl$ was causing me issues as I'm not sure how to setup the plugin fragment directory structure appropriately. I assume I'm not supposed to include a directory called "$nl$" as this gets translated to another string, correct?

For example:
platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.debug.ui/$nl$/icons/full/dtool16/debug_exc.png

becomes

/home/andrew/dev/Eclipse-Workspaces/Spectrum-Theme/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/Eclipse Application/org.eclipse.osgi/96/0/.cp/icons/full/dtool16/debug_exc.png

on my machine.

I assume the $nl$ is getting replaced with /96/0/.cp/?

But don't we need some method of indicating that a plugin A will replace the icons of plugin B? In the case of plugin fragments, it naturally follows that the plugin fragment will replace icons that exist in the host plugin. But for plugins which aren't fragments, they need to be able to specify which plugin's icons they will be replacing.

I may be missing something here conceptually - perhaps this issue is solved with your proposed directory structure convention?

Sorry I could have phrased my issue here a bit better:

I originally thought we'd provide another preference which specify's if there is a plugin that will contribute alternate icons, otherwise we'd check for plugin fragments contributing icon replacements using the /themes/ directory.

I xcurrently don't see how else we could indicate that Plugin A will replace the icons of Plugin B

Similarly to NLS messages, we should just rely on classpath extensions and conventions to enable that. pluginB shouldn't provide image replacements for pluginA, fragmentForPluginA would provide the themes icons for pluginA by adding related resources with right paths for URLImageDescriptor to find them.

With that approach, I don't get how 1 preference can allow to have multiple sources/plugins contributing to a single theme (ie 1 for Platform, another for JDT, another for EGit...), which seems to be a must-have.

Ahhh okay I see now - I was thinking about something outside the scope of this initial patch I suppose.

I was referring to what was discussed in this comment https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=562174#c17 about allowing a plugin to provide icon replacements instead of creating many plugin fragments.

Okay I think I see the issue you're bringing up: with my approach, there could only be 1 "icon theme" plugin in use at once (although if the icon theme fails to provide an alternate icon, plugin fragments would then be checked). 

I was thinking from the perspective of a theme contributor:
- The currently used theme plugin would override all icons that it provides
- If an icon is missing from the theme plugin, then fallback to icon replacements coming from plugin fragments in the /theme/ directory.
- Otherwise, use the original icon

In the case of Platform, JDT, EGit, etc. I was imagining they'd use the plugin fragment approach in order to collectively contribute to an "alternate icon theme". However, they could only contribute to a *single* alternate icon theme in this case.

So the commit message seems incorrect: the change here doesn't seem related to plugin fragments.
It would be worth having the 2 approach as separate/indenpendent commits: 1 about using extensions by fragments only, with some convention on the resource path; and another about overriding with "theme plugins".
To be honest, I'm not a fan of the later one as it's less "native" and less modular and in the end it will drive to more incomplete and less extensible themes and it's a more complex convention and deployment. Looking in classloader/fragments is already successfully used for internationalization; I don't think we should try to do thing differently.

If we go with plugins fragments you will not be able dynamically switch the icon themes or provide compatible icon themes for different themes. When look at the need for icon themes, the color of the main theme do have a relation. It would be nice if a ui theme plugin can also control the icons.

I don't see how another approach based on URL referencing a plugin instead of content inside current fragment allows more dynamism here. After all everything in the end becomes a URL and URLImageDescriptor load the content only once; so as long as the same URLImageDescriptor is used, no runtime dynamism is possible; to have dynamic updates, one would need to reload all URLImageDescriptors and all Images already created. That's basically restarting the application.

That's a different story, that doesn't belong in JFace as JFace itself doesn't have themes. This is more a topic for the Platform Theme engine, which is downstream. Platform themes could reference an icon theme; but it's not something to consider in JFace and plugin/fragment don't change anything to that.

You have a good point. I think we need to restart the application and even when we switch platform themes today we need to restart.

Yes it should be part of platform. But what i don't understand is, is it possible to install multiple fragments to same plugin so that we have install multiple icon themes which might be able to control by the theme engine in platform ? May be this is the reason i was some what confused.

You are correct, the change is in fact about the proposed convention of placing alternate images (icons) in a plugin's /theme/ directory, which take precedence over the default icons. I'll fix that.

Being able to contribute these icon replacements through plugin fragments is just a nice way to accomplish this.


> It would be worth having the 2 approach as separate/indenpendent commits: 1 about using extensions by fragments only, with some convention on the resource path; and another about overriding with "theme plugins".

I totally agree. I think this first commit (the current one) should only deal with providing the ability to replace images through plugin fragments (which seems to work, although there are some issues in the commit that need to be fixed). I brought up the second approach (theme plugins) to explore how difficult it would be to implement, as well as how its implementation differs from the fragment approach.

Although I wrote some more below about the second approach, I'll submit a new patch soon that focuses exclusively on the plugin fragment approach, and removes the $nl$ workaround. This way we can move towards getting this first commit merged. 

> To be honest, I'm not a fan of the later one as it's less "native" and less modular and in the end it will drive to more incomplete and less extensible themes and it's a more complex convention and deployment.

I'm +1 for both approaches, but it's because I see some differences between the two. However, maybe these differences are superficial and I am missing key points about the fragment approach.

- If we had two plugin fragments installed that contribute alternate versions B, C of icon A, how can we determine/indicate which icon should be used (B or C)? Wouldn't we have to uninstall/unload one of the plugin fragments? This is important for the case of when two themes are installed (ie. light and dark theme) which will both contribute alternate versions of the same icon (see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=562174#c23)

My proposed idea was to allow a preference to hold the currently-in-use theme's bundleID, this way two theme plugins which are installed can contribute alternate versions of the same icon by having the theme engine set this preference when either theme is used. 

The downside with my approach is that a theme plugin could only provide a single set of alternate icons. The way Platform's themes are setup is that multiple themes are being contributed by a single plugin. Ideally, we don't want to split up platform's themes (eg. light/dark) into multiple plugins. 

So, one way we could solve this would be by specifying /which/ icon-directory (belonging to the theme plugin) to look in.


For example, consider the following URL:
platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.debug.ui/$nl$/icons/full/dtool16/debug_exc.png

When platform's dark theme is in use, the JFacePreference CUSTOM_RESOURCE_THEME could be set to:
org.eclipse.ui.themes/dark-icons

This would specify that alternate icons should be looked for in the directory "dark-icons" of the plugin org.eclipse.ui.themes.

The resulting icon URL would be something like:
/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/dark-icons/icons/full/dtool16/debug_exc.png

Similarily, when the light them is in use, the preference could be set to:
org.eclipse.ui.themes/light-icons

resulting in the URL:
/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/light-icons/icons/full/dtool16/debug_exc.png


Additionally, if someone wanted to replace all icons used in Eclipse through plugin fragments, they would have to create a separate plugin fragment for each plugin that contributes an icon. This seems a bit more tedious compared to creating a single plugin that will hold all replacement icons (its true that in both cases, the directory structure of the replaced icon would be nearly identical, but creating a new plugin fragment and setting its host plugin is an extra step). 

Also, can a single plugin contribute multiple plugin fragments? ie. is there a way to install multiple plugin fragments when installing a single theme plugin? I'd imagine this is possible as a Feature.

Again, I'm still new to plugin fragments, so bare with me :P

Cery good and valid points @Andrew which is inline with how i see how icons theme support should work.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Hi Mickael,

I still plan to finish this feature, though I think I'd like to migrate it to GitHub once platform.ui has moved to GitHub on April 11th.

I have currently re-opened it though it could potentially be abandoned on Gerrit since I'll continue working on it on GH.

By any chance, do you know what will happen to Gerrit changes such as this one after the migration on April 11th? Will Gerrit become read-only? Or will things be deleted. 

Thanks 😎
