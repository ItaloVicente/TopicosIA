DESCRIPTION:

Bug 562174 - [WIP] Allow plugin fragments to supply alternate icons

Allow plugin fragments to contribute alternate icons that will be loaded
through the URLImageDescriptor class.

The icons must be placed within a directory titled "icon-replacements"
located at the root of the plugin fragment, ie. "/icon-replacements/"

The file name of the replacement icons must match the name of the icon
to be replaced.

For example, in order to replace an icon used by plugin org.eclipse.xxx
where the path of the icon is "/path/To/icon.png" in the plugin's bundle
one must:
- Create a plugin fragment with org.eclipse.xxx as the Host Plug-in
- Create a directory "/icon-replacements/" at the root of the plugin
fragment
- Place an alternate icon with the correct file name in the icon
replacements directory, ie. "/icon-replacements/icon.png"

This still needs more work on correctly checking if the corresponding JFace preference is set amongst other things. In addition, some consensus on the naming convention of alternate icons needs to be established. As a placeholder, I've decided the alternate icons should have the same file name as the icon they are replacing, and they should be placed in a directory called "/icon-replacements".

Also.. happy holidays :)
Line:209, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> As the check for the correct JFacePreference is potentially incorrect (I need some help here), if one wants to test this commit, I recommend removing the first part of the if statement.

Then one can create a plugin fragment with the correct host plugin for the icon they want to replace as detailed in the commit message.

Line:227, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> Technically, there is a bug here in that the correct URL for 1.5 and 2.0 zoom icons (code starting at line 244) is not created before checking if an alternate replacement (themed) icon exists for them. That case should probably be handled.

Line:291, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> Since this method is now being called in getxURL to check if an alternate icon exists, we don't log an exception if an alternate icon is not found.

Line:209, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> @Gayan Thanks for the feedback. I'm not entirely sure what you mean, if you have a further explanation or piece of code you can point me too, please feel free to provide it 😊

Part of what makes this tricky is that JFace is not supposed to depend on Eclipse-specific things (I believe?) so I'm not sure where this JFace preference should reside. 

In a normal Eclipse plugin, we'd just access the correct IPreferenceStore instance and store the preference there. However, from my understanding, these instances are only created in Eclipse plugins, not JFace. JFace does provide however the implementation for these preference stores.

This is why I thought that maybe the preference could be stored inside of the JFaceResources class, as it also contains fonts and colors that can be modified through Eclipse preferences.

Good idea. But then we should opt for a naming scheme that doesn't make a difference between icons, font, images and whatever resources. Maybe instead of "icon-replacement", it should be just "themes" and pattern would be "themes/my.theme.id/<initialPathForNonThemedResource>" for everything (images, fonts,....)

Line:232, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> Isn't there a better logger for JFace?

Line:285, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> Remove

Line:291, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> Isn't it already the purpose of logIOException parameter? I think such logic should be moved to the caller when passing the arguments (ie always pass false on line 227 instead of `zoom == 100`).

Thanks for the feedback Mickael :) 
I'll try to make the suggested changes shortly, and then will potentially need help figuring out how to set a JFaceResource preference to ensure the preference works as intended.
Line:209, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> I'm +1 for making the naming scheme more general as you proposed. Although, I'm a bit uncertain  on how things would work for plugins vs. plugin fragments:

- In the case of a plugin, there would need to be a directory "themes" at the root of the plugin, with a child directory that has the plugin's ID, and then the rest of the path would require the same directory structure as the original icon/resource

- In the case of a plugin fragment, everything would be the same except for "my.theme.id", which would instead be the original resources bundle ID? 

After saying this out loud, it seems OK to me; the only hassle with this approach is copying the exact directory structure as the original icon/resource. However, this may be unavoidable as it prevents conflicts in the case where two different icons have the same filename but different paths.

Line:232, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> Correct, I'll fix that

Line:285, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> Will do

Line:291, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/URLImageDescriptor.java -> Good call, will do this
