Looks good to me, one clarification question below.

I also added Mickael, creator of the report, in case he wants to comment.
Line:261, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/SmartImportJobReportDialog.java -> Why is this new method necessary?

There is still a usability issue with that: if it runs in background by default, and if it takes a lot of time, then user just have the impression imported projects are already usable whereas they're actually not. So by allowing run in background by default here, we introduce a risk of a unusable state being reached by default, while keeping the "Run in background" button guarantees user is aware and careful about the state being temporarily inconsistent for good usage.
I believe "Run in background" by default is fine when the transistional state is workable, but here I don't think it is.

I don't think that is really a problem. Project are usable in the sense that the code can already be modified. Other project importers, e.g., the Gradle one do the same thing, they important and show the project even though the initialization is not yet done. So IMHO we should not block users in their if they did not configure Eclipse to block. Also, the option to run in the background is already there, so this concern can already happen, e.g. user imports something, sets this option and imports something else a few weeks later.

Line:261, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/SmartImportJobReportDialog.java -> I couldn't figure out how to otherwise remove the "Run in Background" Button. So I overwrote this method, copied it's body over here and removed the part where the "Run in Background" button was set.

I mean regarding the inconsistent state(s)

Dani, you were the one who requested that we remove the special background flag. See bug report. This fix is not changing anything regarding the import logic, it is just honoring the global "Always run in background flag" instead of using a dialog specific "Already run in background flag".

OK, I will have to take a closer look. Probably tomorrow.

Thanks. We were putting in resources on our side (Jonas) to solve issues reported by you. If you veto them afterwards, this is not a productive style.
