DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Allow disable the delete confirmation dialog

This should add the preference to allow delete confirmation dialog to be
disabled. After selected the checkbox from the confirmation dialog or
from the system preference, the delete dialog will not be shown after
the delete operation.

Also modify IDEEditorsPreferencePage so that the option is visible in
the IDE.

> We will not change the default but if the user decides that he does not want to see a confirmation dialog, we should not stop him. Why do you want to prevent the user having this choice?

To be honest, I'm more trying to route attention and efforts towards more important parts of this story (undo-able delete) than preventing this to get in now. I wouldn't veto a merge here; but would love to see undo-able delete in and this made default in the IDE.

Line:214, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/actions/DeleteResourceAction.java -> This is extremely dangerous, and looks not correct (deleting content or not shouldn't be related to the question "do you want remember this or not"?)

One question - "do you want to delete?", second - "do you want to delete from the disk?" The second one appears for projects, so *if* we may skip the question fir files / folders, we should NOT skip this for projects.

Line:228, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/actions/DeleteResourceAction.java -> Please don't comment out code, just delete it. We use git for history.

Chenhui, do you plan to act on Andrey's comments or we should abandon this gerrit ?

Abandoned

No news for a long time; let's assume Chenhui is not interested in continuing this work and abandon.
@Chenhui: please ping otherwise.
