DESCRIPTION:

Bug 550888 - New Project wizard - Removing the "Use default location"
clears the Location field

Before that change the user selection was preserved and the user could
enter something, switch to the default, switch back. But I don't think
this is something the user will do, he cannot copy from the default
anyway. So with this change, the location will always be set to the last
calculated default, which is what I expect as IDE user and I think is a
common expectation.
