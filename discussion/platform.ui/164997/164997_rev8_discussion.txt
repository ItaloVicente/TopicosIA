DESCRIPTION:

Gives a notification popup instead of a blocking dialog, the
notification is set to "sticky", i.e. it will not fade out. Also
notification opens only once.

@Lars, I just tried it out. This new notification API is NICE :D

However, one small issue: I don't seem to be able to close/dismiss the notification while the preference page is open. I'm only able to do that after closing the preference page. It's a bit annoying, but this might be a bug with the notification API.

IMO this isin't a direct blocker however, we could merge and see how people react to this issue.

Would a "Restart" link on the notification be nice?

Thanks Andrew and Matthias.

Andrew, As the preference dialog block the main shell, it also blocks the notifications. I think it would be nice if that could be changed, but AFAIK currently this is not possible.

Matthias, for the restart I have https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=564400 as the current dialog also does not support it, I would like to change this phase-wise.
