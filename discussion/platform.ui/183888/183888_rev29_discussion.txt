DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575091: add builder API for AbstractNotificationPopup

Added new fluent builder api to create notification popups.
With this api there is no need to extend AbstractNotificationPopup
anymore (at least for simple use cases).

Also contains some new snippets in Jface snippets plugin for
demonstration.

And a new test plugin for jface.notifications with some tests for the
builder api.

No unfortunately not.
On my mac they are successful. 
So if someone else with Win or Linux could have a look.

I think the issue was that the old notifications were interferring with the tests. I have adjusted the tests so that each notification is closed. This works for me on Linux.
