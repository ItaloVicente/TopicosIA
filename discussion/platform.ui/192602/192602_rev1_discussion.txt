File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> BTW If anybody could say why there are these test classes ending with `Auto` (mainly those within the org.eclipse.ui.tests.dialogs.UIAutomatedSuite), it would be great. Or is it just a "broken window" and all tests should end with `Test`?

I also wonder how you guys distinguish running pure unit tests (like this one) from "integration" ones which need to be run with a workbench instance started up. I haven't noticed any automation in this regard, but I'm just a novice here, so...

Probably just someone who uses another convention. We're not too strict about test names, as long as they run.

We don't explicitly distinguish them. As part of the build, all tests do run as integration tests. Some may run as unit tests, but it's something up to the user of this test to figure out with trial: "Let's try to run it as plain JUnit Test... Cool it works!" is all we have.
