DESCRIPTION:

Bug 563485 - Refactor StringMatcher into TextMatcher

Re-implement the matcher using org.eclipse.core.text.StringMatcher
and rename it to TextMatcher to avoid confusions. Fix the prefix
matching on individual words if wildcards are to be taken literally.

Add tests for the new TextMatcher.

The old StringMatcher is kept because it is used (despite being
internal!) in org.eclipse.equinox.p2.ui.discovery. Once it'll have
been replaced there by TextMatcher, StringMatcher can be removed.

I get compilation errors due to this change, which triggered me that the required API version should be increased.

B.t.w. shouldn't API analysis tooling not also check for required minimal API in a manifest?
Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/misc/TextMatcher.java -> I get a compilation error here, this API is not yet in older version of the StringMatcher. Ensure that you update the required version of the workbench too.

Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/misc/TextMatcher.java -> I thought all versions were updated? org.eclipse.equinox.common is at 3.13.0 (was updated);
the re-export in org.eclipse.core.runtime was updated already independently of this change, and the version number of org.eclipse.core.runtime also is updated. 

I don't think we update the version number multiple times within a release. I suppose you just have to pull org.eclipse.core.runtime?

Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/misc/TextMatcher.java -> @Rolf: any update here? Did pulling eclipse.platform.runtime resolve the problem? Or is there a target platform update needed somewhere to include the newest bundles?

Line:80, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/misc/TextMatcher.java -> Indeed, it has to do with the infamous multiple API changes in an release, forcing the update fixes it. I was triggered because I had a similar issue (without getting errors) in which I did needed to update the required versions.
