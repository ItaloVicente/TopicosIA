DESCRIPTION:

Bug 578871 - prevent UI freeze during UNDO operation + autobuild

While JDT's refactoring correctly tries to interrupt autobuild the UNDO
of the same operation did not. In general all UNDO Operations did not
try to interrupt autobuild.

This adds dependency from ui to resources to make the History operations
become aware of resource scheduling rule.

Build and test are OK, but Eclipse project is currently in a code freeze period.
Please wait for end of code freeze period before merging.

Line:313, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/operations/OperationHistoryActionHandler.java -> I find it a bit too pessimistic; so not best in the general case and thus likely to cause some unnecessary waits. This overall seems like a suboptimal hack and I hope we can find something better; should this duty of showing a BuzyIndicator belong to the progress dialog if it detects some rule is at play? Or maybe have some hook to the manager so that when beginRule() is blocking in the UI Thread is shows the wait/cancel dialog autoamtically?

Line:313, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/operations/OperationHistoryActionHandler.java -> If you find any better i am happy. But i was not able to find such. I would have preferred if getOperation() could also supply a suitable IScheduleRule but it's of type  org.eclipse.core.commands.operations.TriggeredOperations which does not even know about IScheduleRule.
The task is to 1. interrupt autobuild 2. while something else blocks it mus show a wait/cancel dialog. It must not wait for for scheduling in the UI thread. 

Ideas very welcome. 

it's kinda nightmare that there are plugin's that only know about UI or only about resource or only about scheduling.

Would a specialized IJobManager that understands about UI Thread be a possible solution? Currently Job.getJobManager() returns a non-UI aware manager that may cause soem UI Threads; maybe we can bend things a bit in making it a service, or extracting from it a service that could be implemented differently.
If only the beginRule() method would need such hack; we can try to add a service that would allow to override its implementation, for example the ProgressDialog?

Line:313, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/operations/OperationHistoryActionHandler.java -> if you have an idea how it can be done please make a concrete implementation. I just don't know how it could be solved that way. I see that Jobmanager is not aware of either resources nor UI. And that makes sense for refactorings without UI. But all together it's missing an appropriate glue.
i don't even know how one could inject another Jobmanager into InternalJob.manager

Line:313, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/operations/OperationHistoryActionHandler.java -> Currently, one cannot; but as we really never want the a beginRule() to block the UI Thread, in any circumstances, then it's probably worth investing in having the glue directly there instead of implementing pessimistic workarounds here and there.
I think we can fix the problem of "prevent UI freeze because of scheduling rules" in a more general manner and this particular case would inherit from this improvement without change.

Line:313, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/operations/OperationHistoryActionHandler.java -> i absolutely agree that i would be good to have a general solution. I just don't know how. It even have to work well together with existing "workarounds" ... not shown 2 wait dialogs :-)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Mickael
i just found it can't be done in generic way in general: Due to Display.asyncE‌xec() UI Thread does not necessarily mean the User is waiting for the current code running in that thread.
There are background threads which just want to update something unimportant in the UI. For example showing Mouse Hover result. If such background tasks runs some bad code in UI there should not a wait/cancel dialog popping up. It would freeze the UI but still it's not the user waiting for it - only the computer. We have no information in the platform which kind of task is currently running to either pop up a dialog or just fail the operation :-(
