DESCRIPTION:

Bug 549139 - DeleteResourceAction checks with ModelProviders

When closing a project, CloseResourceAction will check with registered
ModelProvider objects. This allows an Eclipse based product to e.g.
issue an extra warning should the project contain a running Java
program.

This change adds similar functionality to DeleteResourceAction, since
such is missing. Models can then validate not only a project close, but
also a project delete.

Looks good, but we need a test, if possible (I see problem with blocking dialog). 

I wonder that none of the existing providers I see in my SDK implement org.eclipse.core.resources.mapping.ModelProvider.validateChange(IResourceDelta, IProgressMonitor).

Have you found a test for CloseActon validation?

No tests for CloseResourceAction that I see. I think we should add a test for our own product, once we have the patch. We have way more control in our tests than in the IDE tests (and can cause way less damage)?

In platform UI there is: org.eclipse.ui.tests.internal.Bug99858Test.testDeleteClosedProject()

I'm not seeing any dialog pop-up during that test.

Likely because there is no model provider to ask during the test, so no dialog.

OK, I think we should do following: add one test with dummy model provider that *allows* close / delete but records if it was asked to do so.

Ideally test would use commands to trigger close/delete, but if possibly actions too (to make sure it works both ways)

The delete command is in JDT UI (likely the same for the close command), this test is in platform UI. I.e. we'll have to resort to the actions, or we need to write a JDT UI test. Which one do you want?

Arrgh. 

OK, should be enough to check only actions here. I don't like if tests are in a different repository, because if you breaks here something, they will not fail.

Probably a test with the resource actions in platform UI and a test with the commands in our product makes the most sense?
