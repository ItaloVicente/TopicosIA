DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472674 - Add type parameters to org.eclipse.core.databinding

* Add type parameters to core databinding classes: DataBindingContext,
  IConverter, IValidator etc.
* Widen the type of some org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable
  methods. This makes possible to use ListDiffVisior<E> on a
  ListDiff<? extends E> to enable calls to those methods from
  obserable value listeners.
* Update tests and examples related to the plugin with type arguments.

I've run into a weird issue when compiling the new Core Databinding code together with EMF Databinding in Eclipse.

I get this error in EMFUpdateListStrategy.java:

    The type com.ibm.icu.text.NumberFormat cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files

The reason for this compile error is not so strange: com.ibm.icu.text.NumberFormat is used in NumberFormatConverter which is used in UpdateStrategy which is inherited by UpdateListStrategy which is inherited by EMFUpdateListStrategy. Thus com.ibm.icu.text.NumberFormat is in the transitive dependencies of EMFUpdateListStrategy.

What is strange however is that this error occur when compiling org.eclipse.emf.databinding with the new (generified) version of org.eclipse.core.databinding, but not with the old version. I can imagine that this would be the case if, for example, com.ibm.icu.text.NumberFormat were used only internally in UpdateStrategy in the old version, but were used in the interface of the class in the new version. But it seems to be used only internally in both version.

I am very puzzled by this error. I will continue to investigate it and try to find a fix or work around.

Various notes and observations:

* If "Import-Package: com.ibm.icu.text" is added to org.eclipse.emf.databinding then the problem goes away and the build succeeds. This could solve the problem for EMF Databinding, but other clients might be affected.
* The error has to do with the fact that the dependency on com.ibm.icu.text is not re-exported by org.eclipse.core.databinding. I have tried to find a way to re-export dependencies that are declared with Import-Package, but not found a way. A way to re-export "Import-Package" dependencies would be the best fix.
* I'd like to try to build org.eclipse.emf.databinding with Maven. But I have not figured out how to use the result of a local build of the new version of org.eclipse.core.databinding with a local build of org.eclipse.emf.databinding with Maven.
* I have tried to figure out exactly what change in the org.eclipse.core.databinding that triggers the problem, but not succeeded so far. 
* A comment on a Bugzilla ticket states that it is not specified how a compiler should handle cases of incomplete class paths. That might explain why this problem could be triggered by seemingly unrelated changes. Link:

Require-Bundle and re-exports are IMHO really bad and lead to bad startup performance because the bundle wiring can not determine the bundle that really exports the package (when other bundles use Import-Package) and it makes a very strict dependency management. If we would make a Require-Bundle dependency to com.ibm.icu, we would loose the option that people could use the smaller base variant of that bundle in their products.

But to deal with transitive dependencies with Import-Package IMHO we need to specify the uses directive on the exported package that causes the described error. So it should be something like this:

Export-Package: org.eclipse.core.databinding;uses:="com.ibm.icu.text",
  ...

Maybe you could test locally if specifying the uses directive in org.eclipse.core.databinding helps you on consuming without the need to add com.ibm.icu.text manually on your side?

Patch Set 21:

I found that removing the type parameters from UpdateStrategy make the compile error disappear. (But this is only an experiment to find the cause, not a solution.)

Somehow the existence of type parameters seem to trigger the compiler to analyse the internals of UpdateStrategy when it compiles EMFUpdateListStrategy, instead of only examine its interface.

This is very weird. I would file a bug report on the compiler if I could figure about how to create a minimal example of it.

I don't know how to handle it. I will think more about it.

I have done some reading about re-exports and I agree that it seems best to avoid that if possible.

No, the "uses" directive makes no difference.
