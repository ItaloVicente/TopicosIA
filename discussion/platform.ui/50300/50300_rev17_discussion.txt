DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472674 - Add type parameters to org.eclipse.core.databinding

* Add type parameters to core databinding classes: DataBindingContext,
  IConverter, IValidator etc.
* Widen the type of some org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable
  methods. This makes possible to use ListDiffVisior<E> on a
  ListDiff<? extends E>, which is more convenient for all clients
  and doesn't have any drawbacks. The changes should be fully
  backwards compatible for source and binaries.
* Update a few tests an examples related to the plugin with type arguments.

Patch Set 17:

The exercise to update some tests and examples was useful. I discovered some things we had overlooked.

Patch set 17 contains this:

* Wildcards that was missed some UpdateValueStrategy#getXxxValidator methods.
* StringToNumberConverter has got a type parameter for the return type, in the same way as NumberTotringConverter. This should be both source and runtime backwards compatible. 
* The return type of the factory methods of StringToNumberConverter has got appropriate type arguments. The result can be seen in StringToNumberConverterTest. I don't think this will break code for any clients, they will be working with a raw converter type which will be okay.
* A bug is fixed with the type of WritableSet#withElementType. This is not strictly related to type parameters in Databinding Core, but was needed in UpdateSetStrategyTest. Now this method has a type that corresponds to the types of WritableList/Value#withElementType.
* All tests and examples that use UpdateStrategys, converters or validators are updated with type arguments. 

Byte the way: I bumped the org.eclipse.core.databinding version to from 1.6.200 to 1.7.0. You've probably seen this already.

Please notify me, if you're done with the patch, so I can ask for a CQ, because the patch is bigger than 1000 lines. During the CQ process you should not update the patch.
Line:268, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/ListBinding.java -> Unfortunately these methods are breaking changes, because an existing subclass of ListBinding that overrides the method getTarget:IObservable without changing the return type would not compile with this change. You can store the model and target as members like in ValueBinding. This would also avoid the unchecked casts.
Same applies for SetBinding.

From Tom:

One more note before you merge:
a) make sure EMF-Databinding still compiles
b) make sure EMF-Databinding (who IIRC is compiled against an older API
   - Helios) still works without getting recompiled

If you break EMF-Databinding you break the complete e4 tooling and most
likely a lot more.

Yet more warnings in downstream code. :(  Yet more reasons why one cannot maintain compatibility in downstream frameworks with older versions of Eclipse, except by accepting a sea or raw type warnings.

I'm glad Tom and I didn't adjust EMF databindng to the last round of data binding generification. 

Is the generification now complete or will there be more rounds of this?

AFAICS after merging this one, it should be complete.

I understand your suffering. EMF databinding code is not pretty after the addition of type parameters on org.eclipse.core.databinding.property and observable. That's why I started my experiment to add type parameters to Ecore: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=531316

To me it is not at all clear whether adding type parameters to the databinding classes was a good idea to start with, considering how hard it is for some downstream projects to follow. But since those two bundles already have got type parameters I think it is best to move on and complete the work.

> Is the generification now complete or will there be more rounds of this?

There are the org.eclipse.jface.databinding and org.eclipse.core.databinding.beans bundles that should be tackled at some point I guess. But I don't think EMF will be affected by that.

Thanks for the heads up. We'll make sure to tests for that.

Line:268, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/ListBinding.java -> Done.

I added fields with the specific type as in ValueBinding. That also *slightly* changes the behaviour for sub-classes that override getTarget/Model to do anything funky.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:107, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/conversion/NumberToStringConverter.java -> Done. But one question:

Doesn't this method (and the corresponding one in StringToNumberConverter) suffer from the same problem as the ListBinding#getTarget override with a narrowed return type?

That is, in the (very unlikely) case that someone overrides this method their code will have compilation errors if we switch to String as return type. Is that risk worth taking into account?

Line:107, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/conversion/NumberToStringConverter.java -> Theoretically yes, but this class cannot be subclassed because it has only privat econstructors. That's why we are safe here.
