DESCRIPTION:

Bug 472674 - Add type parameters to org.eclipse.core.databinding

* Add type parameters to core databinding classes: DataBindingContext,
  IConverter, IValidator etc.
* Widen the type of some org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable
  methods. This makes possible to use ListDiffVisior<E> on a
  ListDiff<? extends E> to enable calls to those methods from
  obserable value listeners.
* Update tests and examples related to the plugin with type arguments.

Patch Set 22:

Patch set 22 contains a workaround for the weird build path problem I got in org.eclipse.emf.databinding.

It turned out that the weird behaviour was triggered by a combination of three things:

* EMFUpdateListStrategy extends UpdateStrategy (transitively through UpdateListStrategy) 
* UpdateStrategy is now generic
* UpdateStrategy had (private) methods with types from com.ibm.icu.text in their signature

The work around is to remove com.ibm.icu.text.NumberFormat for the signature of all method in UpdateStrategy and replace it with java.text.Format (which is a super class of com.ibm.icu.text.NumberFormat). All those methods were private so this change does not affect any external code.

This makes the compilation problem magically go away.

I have managed to create a minimal example of the problem and will report it as a bug to the compiler project.

I still have some testing of the interaction with EMF databinding to do before this change can be merged.

I'd like to report that I'm still working on this.

I've been struggling to make a Tycho build of EMF databinding using the modified Core databinding bundle. But I haven't yet found a way to build Core databinding into an update site. Maybe I have to build the entire platform for that...

"mvn clean verify -Pbuild-individual-bundles" should build the repo. If you need an update site for that you could create a new project with a category and pom file and include it into the build.

Jens, master is open for development. Could you rebase this manually and tell me that the status is?
