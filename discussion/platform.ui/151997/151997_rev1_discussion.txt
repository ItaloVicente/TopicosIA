I've added a detailed explanation for the changes.

With these changes the I'm able to properly register different installers (one replacing another at the user's discretion) to launch the appropriate registered installer from the browser for links with eclipse+installer scheme.
Line:85, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/RegistrationMacOsX.java -> In my case the registrations did not start with this string. I don't know if this guard is important, but on my Mac virtual box where I downloaded the installer's *.dmg and copied it to the desktop, this filter removed the registrations from consideration.

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/RegistrationMacOsX.java -> This is to unregister any exist registrations for the scheme. It's questionable here whether we should be attempt to modify the Info.plist of the other application.  Probably better that we do because I believe this unregisters all launch aspects of this other application.  But we should keep in mind that the other application might be deleted so in that case the Info.plist is not available for modification and then we should only unregister it.

Line:75, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/RegistrationMacOsX.java -> This is to deal with duplicates.  If there are no registrations then we return only the empty registration. Otherwise we collect all the registrations for the scheme. In principle there should only be one, but in actual fact that might not be the case.

Line:97, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/RegistrationMacOsX.java -> As above, it seems best to assume there might be duplicates because there are cases where that happens in practice. Perhaps because of previous bad attempts with the prior implementation which did not prevent duplicates.

Line:105, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/RegistrationMacOsX.java -> The scheme might contain pattern meta-characters, i.e., both eclipse+installer and eclipse+mpc will not work without quoting.

Line:151, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/RegistrationMacOsX.java -> This is to ensure that a self-hosted launch returns null like it does on Windows.  No app path is available for a self-host launch.

I see we'll need to increment the version but let's see how the review process proceeds and I can include that change in subsequent amends.

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/RegistrationMacOsX.java -> we by intention did not attempt to modify the info.plist of another app.
One has to remove the registration in the other app manually.
The platform pref page also provides a hint for the user.

Line:105, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/RegistrationMacOsX.java -> okay. that part looks good.
Can you provide a separate commit accompanied with a unit test?

Line:85, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/RegistrationMacOsX.java -> what does the lsregister call return on your os
what version of macOS do you have?
