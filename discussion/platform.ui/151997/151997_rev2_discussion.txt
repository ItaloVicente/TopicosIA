Barring objections, I'll merge this later today or tomorrow in time for M3.

I can hack around all the other bugs and limitations in the installer code, and I guess I'll have to assume that on a real Mac or a newer version of MacOS that lsregister entries really do start with BundleClass, though personally I would change it to use a pattern that allows it to start with "Container mount state:" which is what I see.

Line:46, tests/org.eclipse.tests.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/TestUnitLsregisterParser.java -> why is that necessary?

Line:46, tests/org.eclipse.tests.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/TestUnitLsregisterParser.java -> Because on my Windows machine the files are checked out with CRLF endings and those are what's read in.  The literals are explicitly just LF and the parsers and matching don't like/handle CRLF. So all these replaceAlls were needed just to make the exist tests run and pass on a system that where the input files are CRLF encoded.  Of course these replaceAll calls are harmless no-ops if the contents don't contain CRLF.

Line:46, tests/org.eclipse.tests.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/TestUnitLsregisterParser.java -> I find it worth to have the CRLF on another commit. Because there are multiple source code areas with the replace call.
Furthermore this fix is better understandable then.
WDYT?

Line:46, tests/org.eclipse.tests.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/registration/TestUnitLsregisterParser.java -> I've already spent many days on this.  Fixing all the problems on my horrible Mac virtual machine, backing them out to fix only the approved one-liner, getting tests to even run for me, and then adding new tests.  The end result is less than ideal for me, leaving my downstream code with ugly mac-only hacks just to get behavior that's consistent with Windows and Linux.

Now now your asking me to back out test-only changes; the tests then won't run for me.  Then commit this, wait for the forever build to finish yet again. Submit that hoping nothing gets caught in between, which would require yet another forever build. Then commit something else in separate review, wait for yet another forever build to finish.  And all this for the sole purpose of an alternative commit history?

So if you ask WDYT? I would ask do you really feel this is a necessary prerequisite for this contribution? :-P

If I must I will, because the additional week of effort that I invested on getting links to work in the installer in the first place is kind of bogus if this doesn't work properly on all platforms.
