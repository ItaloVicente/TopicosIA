Thanks guys.  

Sorry for the snarky undertone in my most recent comment.  This has really been a lot of work, and I'll be traveling for 10 days as of Wednesday, so my time is running very short...

This URI scheme stuff is really cool and very useful and I very much appreciate that you guys contributed this great technology to Eclipse!
