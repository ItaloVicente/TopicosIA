DESCRIPTION:

Bug 400835 - Add search box to property sheet

Improved implemetation of properties view filtering. Localized changes
only to PropertySheetView class

Implemented desired changes from last CR.  
* Didn't implement mouse listener because I don't handle default initial
text therefore no code is needed there.
* Didn't implement traverse listener because didn't understand what it
did in the FilteredTree class.
* Didn't change getControl method because it would disable the whole
property sheet.

Arieh, you indicated that he thinks fixing the layout is hard, so I gave it a try, should now look like Paul wanted.

@Paul, should we not use SWT.SEARCH and SWT.ICON_SEARCH as style bits for the Text field? In this case we would not need a button. This would be similar to the Window -> Preference

Example for such a Text:

Text search = new Text(parent, SWT.SEARCH | SWT.CANCEL
| SWT.ICON_SEARCH);

I'd be fine with that, except then doesn't the pattern have to be similar to org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt.internal.copy.FilteredTree.useNativeSearchField(Composite) ?  Then we'd need the support code that switches depending on if the platform supports the native search field.

Sounds good to me, I leave it to Arieh to adjust the code. I hope the help with his layout problem motivated him. 

[Arieh, to tell you the secret how I fixed the layout, I used WindowBuilder for it:-)] See http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseWindowBuilder/article.html

Lars, thanks for the change. But from a usability point of view, having the button so far from the text is not very good, since it will require a lot of mouse movement to get there. Also, I don;t think someone will enter so much text. But if you think this is better, I don't mind.
Regarding the initialization of the clear button - the posted is not the code that creates the button - that code is here: http://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/tree/bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse%20UI/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/FilteredTree.java#n959
And I still don't understand what is the problem with the current implementation. I leave it to you guys to decide what will happen to this change. Thanks for the help.

We have the UI elements in FilteredTree that filter stuff.  This implementation has to look and work the same way (which is why you were pointed to the existing code).  It doesn't look or work the same way, and so this patch is currently incomplete.  Once you bring it up to snuff, we can review it again.

Simon, FYI. You are planning to implement this with a different approach but this code might be useful for you.
