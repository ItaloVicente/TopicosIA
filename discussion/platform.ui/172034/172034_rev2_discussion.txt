Thanks for creating further factories.

Some comments..
Line:23, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/CLabelFactory.java -> This offers several benefits over creating CLabel normal way:

Clabel instead of Label

Line:59, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/CLabelFactory.java -> CLabel extends Canvas (extends Composite) and so should the factory.
If needed, we should have a AbstractCanvasFactory inheriting from AbstratCompositeFactory.
But there is only setCaret, setFont, setIme in Canvas so you might directly inherit from AbstractCompositeFactory if we do not need the methods. We can add the class later in between.

I would not recommend to add methods from Canvas in CLabelFactory. You remember the setData method in ButtonFactory moved to WidgetFactory: the api was broken and it needed an exception to get the build successful.

Line:59, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/CLabelFactory.java -> Some setter methods of CLabel are missing.
-margins -> maybe all in one method?!
-tooltip
-alignment
-...

But I'm not sure which ones are needed often. In order to not overload the factory with methods we should have the most important ones only.

Line:108, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/CLabelFactory.java -> CLabel#setImage
