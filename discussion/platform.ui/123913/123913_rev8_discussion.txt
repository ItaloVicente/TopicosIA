DESCRIPTION:

Bug 532530 - Eclipse Forms no longer wrapping

Add a new test suite, ScrolledFormTest, that validates the
size of the content area after laying out ScrolledForms
with various parameters.

Change SharedScrollComposite.reflow to:
- Apply the minimum size in a manner closer to what
  4.6 used.
- Handle the expandHorizontal=false case in a manner closer
  to what the JavaDoc promises (that is: it won't stretch a
  control beyond its preferred size in cases where the
  expand flag is disabled).

Update SizeCache.computeMinimumWidth to handle SWT wrapping
controls better. Uses the same heuristics as
LayoutGenerator for identifying wrapping controls. For
wrapping controls with very long preferred sizes, the
new heuristics clamp the horizontal preferred size.
This is safe to do since such controls can always wrap
to avoid truncation and the purpose of the
computeMinimumWidth method is to compute the minimum
usable size for the control without truncation.

There are a lot of corner cases, so it may be easier
to read the test cases to understand what the
intended behavior is than to try to figure out the
behavior by looking at the code itself.

Looks like ScrolledFormTest#testHorizontalExpand consistently fails.

Yeah. I missed a few use cases the first few times I moved use-cases to their own disabled test. They've all been disabled now.

AFAIK, this is good to go now.

Works fine.

However, we are past RC4, which means you would have to bring this bug forward on the PMC mailing list with a risk assessment. The PMC then decides whether a respin after RC4 is warranted. See https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/freeze_plan_4_8.php for all the details.

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=532530#c4 mentions a possible workaround, so, we might just deliver it to 4.9/master.

I leave that up to you.

Dani, you or Lars will have to merge this when you think it's appropriate. I may not be easily reachable via email for a bit.

For 4.8 it is too late. What does "a bit" mean?
