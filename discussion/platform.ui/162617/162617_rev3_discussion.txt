Hmm, hard to say.

the comment "// Un-maximize the element before tearing it down" is so explicit that it sounds like someone had good reason to do it this way. :)

Question is just why? and is it still necessary?.

This this removal really such an expensive operation? Otherwise, I'd just leave it there to avoid any surprises.

Maybe some old testing code. ;-)

Depends on the size of the list. If someone would add lots of tags. AFAIC contains of a list is linear with the size of its elements.

It was added in de3b05122fa80634221165f19a1cd3ae6401dffd

Fix for Bug 322439 - [Intro] Platform UI changes to support intro
    in Eclipse 4

So it looks like if the flags is not removed and for example the intro page is closed the rest of the views are not shown again.

You could however remove the if() and simply call remove() directly, no need to search through the list twice

According to the documentation MAXIMIZED cannot be applied to all model elements, so maybe checking the type of element might improve too.
