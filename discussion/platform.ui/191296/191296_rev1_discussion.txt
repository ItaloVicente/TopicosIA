DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579019 - Clicking on NotificationPopup should reveal parent window

NotificationPopup has absolute positioning and is always shown on the
top of desktop environments windows stack. If there are any 3rd windows
on the top of the parent window, it is not clear to what window the
popped-up notification belongs to. On clicking on the header of
notification nothing happens. This is confusing.

With this change: parent window is shown (brought upfront) on
NotificationPopup header click.

Line:108, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> Please reword the comment to: "Don't specify SWT.NO_FOCUS style, as this prevents the main Window from being activated if ..."

Line:110, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> From my POV Advantest code should specify the styles here itself, excluding SWT.NO_FOCUS. Or that is not possible?

I don't know where Eclipse uses notification pop-ups and whether this change is fine in all those places.

Line:121, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> I don't think this new code should apply if SWT.NO_FOCUS is set (e.g. someone calls this constructor directly and specifies the style).

Line:129, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> I don't understand "show parent window notification on notification click", please re-phrase. Just "show parent window on notification click"?

Line:264, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> This works wherever I click on the pop-up? Not just at some area of the pop-up?

Line:108, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> Done

Line:110, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> >From my POV Advantest code should specify the styles here itself, excluding SWT.NO_FOCUS. Or that is not possible?
It is and that's what we do right now. 
That is the point of this change: this flag prevents the parent window from being focused and brought upfront on click. We have this fix, but now we want to fix this for everyone.
I believe this must be fine in any scenario. Or you have some use case in your mind that can be affected by this change?

Line:121, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> If the flag is explicitly set clicking on the notifications header will result in nothing (same state as we have now).

Line:129, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> Done

Line:264, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> This works if one clicks on a title.

Line:110, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> As I've said, I don't know where this code is used (I've not checked). I don't think we should touch it without checking this.

Line:264, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> And the rest of the pop-up?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Andrey, can you review this?

I assume the change will have to be moved to a PR, but it can be reviewed already here.

Line:121, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> I think clients should control which shell is used and they also may set OTHER parent shell after this call, so that is not OK. I will push an updated patch that fixes that.

Line:264, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.notifications/src/org/eclipse/jface/notifications/AbstractNotificationPopup.java -> Absolutely right, that must be also accessible to clients that may want to add same behavior to custom controls. I will push an updated patch that fixes that.
