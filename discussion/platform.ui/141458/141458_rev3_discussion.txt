DESCRIPTION:

Use Arrays.asList instead of copying array in a for loop

While there are disadvantages in some cases using this approach the
advantages are imho these:
1) It is shorter and easier to read
2) It allows to have internal optimization in future to make use of
internal parallelism (same argument as for lambda expressions)
see internal iteration
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/
3) Because the size is known beforehand when calling addAll there is no
need to increase the size of the list while processing the loop

Already java 9 includes performance improvements, see
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8155600
I am sure there is more to come. This expression is much easier to
optimize for the compiler than a loop.

Carsten, please also update the z part of the x.y.z.qualifier version by 100 for the failing bundles. See build log.

Thomas, as you already did all the work to check the files for the wrong usage of spaces vrs tabs, can you create a Gerrit for them (with reformatted content)?

No. No time and I don't have an Eclipse set up right now for platform development. Besides I'm not a committer so I couldn't push a new patch set onto this.

Note that all these (semi-?)automated refactorings would need to be checked whether they introduce mixed indentation. I.e., not just this change but also the others Carsten did. I won't have time to look though all these changes.

Apart from the indentation the changes here look OK to me.

Setup is as simple as cloning the repo from https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/admin/projects/platform/eclipse.platform.ui and setting the API baseline (or setting it to warining)

New Gerrit for the formating based on origin/master would be OK

Formatting is unfortunately a mess in org.eclipse.jface. Maybe we should simply reformat the whole code to make contributions easier instead of this file by file dance?

Hi Lars,
I second that. I already suggested to do a general reformating in https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/140162/.

Of course you should not do it without a good reason because all diffs that include the point of time when you reformat everything will show a lot of unrelated changes. On the other hand I think when it slows down the developement process a lot I think it is justified to do it.
