Thanks, Carsten

Please remove the unrelated files (xmx, properties) and explain in the commit message why the new approach is better.

In fact I'm not sure it is.

  someCollection.addAll(Arrays.asList(someArray))

may produce a temporary clone of someArray if someCollection is an ArrayList (looking at the code of ArrayList and Arrays$ArrayList in Java 8), and I see many of these cases. Beware if someArray could be large.

Indentation needs to be made consistent (looks like platform uses generally tabs to indent, except in JFace, where 4 spaces are used).
Line:343, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/CoolBarManager.java -> Inconsistent indentation.

Line:254, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/action/ToolBarContributionItem.java -> Inconsistent indentation.

Line:52, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/deferred/SetModel.java -> Inconsistent indentation.

Line:344, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/ide/undo/WorkspaceUndoUtil.java -> Inconsistent indentation.

Line:75, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/IDESelectionConversionService.java -> Inconsistent indentation.

Line:251, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/markers/MarkerResourceUtil.java -> Inconsistent indentation.

Hi Lars, Hi Thomas,
thanks for the detailed review, Thomas.
May I ask you to first decide if you are willing to apply the changes before I spend more time on formatting issues?
While there are disadvantages in some cases using this approach the advantages are imho these:
1) It is shorter and easier to read
2) It allows to have internal optimization in future to make use of internal parallelism (same argument as for lambda expressions)
see internal iteration https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/
3) Because the size is known beforehand when calling addAll there is no need to increase the size of the list while processing the loop

Already java 9 includes performance improvements, see https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8155600
I am sure there is more to come. This expression is much easier to optimize for the compiler than a loop.

And regarding the formatting of different core modules in a different way - I already said it in a different gerrit commit: It really would be helpful if you format everything in one step (using an eclipse setting that everybody can use by importing a formatting preference file). That would simplify contributions a lot. I could do it for you but the amount of lines that would be changed would cause a CQ to be necessary and doing a review would be a nightmare:)

Actually the space-indented JFace files are an anomaly. The projects, including JFace, do have Eclipse formatter settings (in .settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs) that do specify TAB for indentation (tab width 4 characters).

For this change it's probably best to just follow the indentation style used in the touched file. Mixed TAB-space indentation isn't going to work well, and mixing them on the same line is even worse.

I presume you're using a tool to do these refactorings. If that tool is outside of Eclipse, Eclipse formatting may not get applied. Opening the files and reformatting wholly will likely lead to many unrelated changes. So I'm afraid manually going through the refactored code lines and manually correcting any indentations is the only way I see to fix this. :-(

This still neeeds to be done.

For the files which were affected by this change and used spaces I reformatted these files via https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/141496/

Thomas/Carsten let me know if more files affected by this Gerrit should be adjusted. AFAICS the other files reported by Thomas use already the correct tab style.

+1 for the change, please make the requested updates.

I suggest to wait until I merge https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/141496/ and rebase your change onto it.
