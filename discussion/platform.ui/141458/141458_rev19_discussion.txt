DESCRIPTION:

Use Arrays.asList instead of copying array in a for loop

While there are disadvantages in some cases using this approach the
advantages are imho these:
1) It is shorter and easier to read
2) It allows to have internal optimization in future to make use of
internal parallelism (same argument as for lambda expressions) see
internal iteration
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/
3) Because the size is known beforehand when calling addAll there is no
need to increase the size of the list while processing the loop Already
java 9 includes performance improvements, see
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8155600 I am sure there is more
to come. This expression is much easier to optimize for the compiler
than a loop.

Carsten, this one looks good to me. I leave the final review to Alex, I guess he will review once 4.13 opens in 1-2 weeks. Please update your other Gerrits.

Looks also good to me.
I'd prefer to have a bugzilla that describes the reasoning of this refactoring as you describe it in the commit message and link the bugzilla to the change.
For trivial changes this is not mandatory, and each change here might be trivial, but overall the change has a size to not make it trivial.
