DESCRIPTION:

Use Arrays.asList instead of copying array in a for loop

While there are disadvantages in some cases using this approach the
advantages are imho these:
1) It is shorter and easier to read
2) It allows to have internal optimization in future to make use of
internal parallelism (same argument as for lambda expressions)
see internal iteration
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/streams/
3) Because the size is known beforehand when calling addAll there is no
need to increase the size of the list while processing the loop

Already java 9 includes performance improvements, see
https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8155600
I am sure there is more to come. This expression is much easier to
optimize for the compiler than a loop.

If the wrong formatting in Jface creates an issue for contributions, I'm fine with a reformat. 

@Carsten, please create a Gerrit for the format adjustments and add me as reviewer
