DESCRIPTION:

Bug 559589 - Make WorkbenchImages#getDescriptors and getImageRegistry
thread-safe and remove from Workbench init code

As WorkbenchImages#getDescriptors and getImageRegistry were not
thread-safe the methods were called during init of the Workbench even
though the result was not used.

By make the method thread-safe, we can remove the call during the
initialization of the workbench

Also ensure that the methods are executed in the main UI thread.

Yes, but this doesn't make code better. Calling getImageRegistry from non-UI thread most probably means the client side error. I would rather fail with InvalidThreadAccess in this case. If the can move mutex field assignment to be the last call in the guarded method - this can solve it.

Line:406, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchImages.java -> I would leave the original code as is if you have no good reason to change it. 

As of today, background thread could use the code to get an image descriptor if the code was initially properly initialized. Such code would be OK.
Now that will possibly deadlock with *two* new locks introduced!

@Andrey your arguments are quite strong. After reading more things around I can see other Workbench JFace resources initialized near images and this is not clear why images are more special than let's say fonts. In other words we should either rework all the code that related to JFace resources or keep it unchanged until the better reason to change it.
