Andrey, let me try to explain

After rebase the test failed with the following result:

Expected: <null> but was: [<1992 RGB {108, 25, 143} Chrysler 0.29011853387902153 >, <RGB {43, 246, 253} Honda 320i 0.5850360659420364 >]

This kind of error I expected. However, after the first build by Hudson we got the error:

Expected: <null> but was: <empty selection>

This confused me, i was not expecting the <empty selection> here. However, after reviewing the test code, I realized that the test used random selections. This random selection can also be the <empty selection>. So the first failure does make sense too.
Also, the selection will be <null> when the fix-patch is applied. Thus this this test case is correct after all.

Rolf, I still can't follow. I honestly don't know what do you want to say with all that above. Do you mean you have to fix existing test code?

I thought there was a problem in this patch to implement the test, but there is no problem. All comments above by me can be ignored.
