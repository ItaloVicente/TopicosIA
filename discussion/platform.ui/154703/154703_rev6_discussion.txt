Looks fine to me, seems to do the same as the old code. In general I wonder if more EMF API should be used to manipulate the model. See comment.
Line:148, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/addons/ModelCleanupAddon.java -> General note: This does remove the PartDescriptor from the Descriptors list. However, this does not ensure that the element is completely removed from the model (there might still be references to the PartDescriptor).
Is the model (engine) supposed to clean these references, or should we be using EcoreUtil#delete/deleteAll?

Moreover, this method seems to duplicate the behavior provided by Collection#removeAll

Line:148, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/addons/ModelCleanupAddon.java -> I also have an impression that implementation here needs to be more concentrated on the fact that we are changing the most important shared resource of the E4 RPC - "MApplication"
I would expect some kind of mutex-guarded access here.

Line:148, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/addons/ModelCleanupAddon.java -> EMF by itself is not thread safe. Within Eclipse E4 this is mitigated by only modifying the model in the UI thread. So the guarded access is tied to the UI thread. Many side effects of the model manipulation result in UI changes, so this is by itself a sufficient and necessary design.

However, AFAIK, no guards are in place that the model is only manipulated on the UI thread.

We bet on this at 2002 and about 2006 our product was all in fights with scalability issues, in 2009 it was mostly dead. Just an input for the future discussions regarding the approach.

> no guards are in place that the model is only manipulated on the UI thread.

Please read our discussion with Lars obive. Modifications are done inside "uiSync.asyncExec"
