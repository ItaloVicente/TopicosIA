Lars, I can see more and more CompletableFuture employed. This is very powerful technics, but it introduces another dimension of complexity for the things that should be done "in some order". Do we have clear Platform policy when to use Jobs and when to use Futures? May be it will be better to discuss with the "platform-dev" mailing list.

So far we are using Futures for short calculations like code minings in which the user should not be able to see and stop the calculation.

Yes, mining is a good example of let's say "safe leaf async calculation": we are not expecting another actor to draw another mining for the same editor area. BTW, is that true?

But here you are modifing the shared resource MApplication from another thread: the academic example of potential race condition.

I modify it in the main thread, see the uiSync.asyncExec().  I only calculate what to remove in another thread. And in the main thread I check again it if is available.
if (elementsToBeRemoved.contains(object)) {
				iterator.remove();
			}

Ah, I missed that! 
Lars, I don't want to blame you, I just want to highlight the fact that we are stepping on the thin ice here.

Hey Alexander, I like your feedback thanks for that. All well intended feedback is very much welcomed and questioning a certain approach is definitely desired. But I think we are save here and currently the code run not in the UI thread (event fired outside main thread) so we should wrap it into a Display.asyc call.
