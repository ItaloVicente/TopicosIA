Thanks for the good progress, Ralf!
We are close to provide high grade implementation for this functionality.

Master will be open soon and I hope we can get this gerrit merged before M1.
Line:84, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/AboutDialogE4.java -> I suggest to resolve these two references separately, you can have two methods:
Optional<Image> aboutImage
Optional<AboutItem> aboutItem

after that the code should be less complex

Line:133, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/AboutDialogE4.java -> the whole method is guarded by this condition - please move it outside the method

Line:157, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/AboutDialogE4.java -> the method name asks to split it

Line:192, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/AboutDialogE4.java -> `{}` may be ommited for single statement

Line:70, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/AboutItem.java -> Let's avoid `null` and rework to empty string

Line:41, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/AboutText.java -> Looks like it needs future decomposition, too much responsibilities

Line:52, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/AboutText.java -> `private final Supplier<AboutItem>` to be passed to constructor 

this way we can have both immutability and lazy calculation

Line:74, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/AboutText.java -> This method (except the very last statement) should be extracted to a separate class and prepared to be unit-tested

Line:33, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/BrandingProperties.java -> Will see later do we need it at all in this form
Either Consumer or Function may be preferable.

Line:17, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/HyperlinkRange.java -> please make it final

Line:19, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/HyperlinkRange.java -> Please use individual declaration for each field
Please make them final

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/HyperlinkRange.java -> just `offset()` in true OOP :)

Line:30, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/HyperlinkRange.java -> just 'length()' in true OOP :)

Line:34, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/HyperlinkRange.java -> `contains(int position)` ?
looks more readable

Line:25, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/ProductInformation.java -> final, right?

Line:27, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/ProductInformation.java -> final, as it is always known in constructor

Line:33, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/ProductInformation.java -> A bit different:

```
public ProductInformation(IProduct product)
//We are not failing for "null" here, because this is what we can get from Platform, instead of that we substitute "null" with special implementation.
   this.product = Optional.ofNullable(product).orElse(new UnavailableProduct());
```

Line:43, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/ProductProperties.java -> That will need rework. All that lazy initializers should be replaced with Supplier<>(s) to make it immutable as it wraps immutable branding data.

Line:158, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/ProductProperties.java -> here you can fail, as about image may not be specified
I would declare the method as
`public Optional<ImageDescriptor> aboutImage`
to let the client decide how to deal with this situation.

Line:187, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/ProductProperties.java -> The same as about image descriptor above

Line:21, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/dialogs/about/UnavailableProduct.java -> +1, please make it final
type should be either abstract or final
