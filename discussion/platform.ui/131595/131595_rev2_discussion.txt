Strange. Tests run locally on my system. Cannot see why the new property should affect these tests anyway. Any hints?

I've had this on my list for years and I'm very happy you've taken it on.

I took a quick look at the test failures and it looks like some of them are because of differences in toString() due to a new property.

Lars had a key insight on bug 485454: there's no need to make a persisted property to indicate that something should not be persisted.  Instead, just add a key to the element's transient data. The nice thing about this approach is that it's simple and doesn't require changing the EMF model.

It would be nice to have some tests.

I did see the field for transient data but was not sure if I may use it for that purpose. Is there a class defining constants for such fields? Also not sure where to put documentation for this so users can find it.

I can also make some tests for it.
