The new patch also uses hardcoded values (which are less dynamic and can cause trouble in other cases than the one we're talking about). I'd really love to see a solution that doesn't involve hardcoding anything, but just reacting to the actual constraints of the parent; so if parent changes, it adapts.

Line:77, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Why hardcoding a size here?

Line:78, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Couldn't we get rid of the margins (0) as we center the widget?

Line:126, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> That seems to be a good track.

Line:77, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> I think you need a size somewhere. Without size the toolbar would be as small as possible which is likely to small. And the toolbar itself doesn't seem to have a size atm.

Line:78, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> With 0 margin the button gets larger and looks more ugly. But the resulting hight doesn't depend on the specific margin value anymore

Line:76, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Have you investigrated getting rid of this intermediary composite here? It could make things simpler.

Line:77, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> The button here shouldn't be responsible for the size of the toolbar IMO, it needs to react to it, not drive it.

Line:78, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Ok. As this one seems internal to the composite and doesn't affect the toolbar itself, it may be fine.

Line:76, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Possible but doesn't made things simpler for me. You still need to set the buttons height or it would depend on the perspective switcher.
Also you cannot set horizontal margin anymore because the parents layout is not known.

Line:77, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> I agree. But from what I see atm nothing is really responsible for the toolbar hight and it just come out to be the largest element which was in the past perspective switcher or quick search.

Ok, I see it's challenging to have the button reacting to parent size, when parent doesn't seem constrained.
I suggest you just pick the patch you prefer and merge it. Although not ideal, it's better.
