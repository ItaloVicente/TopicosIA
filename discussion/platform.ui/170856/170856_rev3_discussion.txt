DESCRIPTION:

Bug 567898 - [JFace][HiDPI] ImageDescriptor support alternative naming
scheme for high dpi

Currently ImageDescriptor automatically provides higher DPI images if a
resource exits that ends with @x2 or @1.5

This works well if only one resolution is used across the application
(e.g. 16x16 pixel icons) but rapidly blows up if multiple resolutions
are used as there are duplications. The second limitation is that only
two fixed zoom levels are supported at the moment.

The current approach can be enhanced to support another common scheme
where icon resources are organized in folders holding the resolution in
folder-name (e.g. icons/16x16/icon1.png, icons/32x32/icon1.png and so
on). This also has the advantage that it is possible to implement other
scaling factors beside the currently fixed ones without any code
changes.

This commit includes the following:

- add/extend test cases for both schemes (current + fallback) to ensure
compatibility with both schemes
- add proposed alternative naming scheme for high-dpi icons as a
fallback if the @x2/@x1.5 does not find a suitable resource

Thanks for explanation, I have adjusted the commit message to explain the rationale and the solution in more detail now.

Christoph, commit message is excellent now, thanks. Regarding the review: I'm sorry, too many other things needs my time. Matthias did some work on icons, so may be he is interested.

do we need to register the new test class in some Test-Suite to get executed?

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> but with the new naming scheme the number of files does not change. It simply is organized differently. Correct?

Line:23, /COMMIT_MSG -> what code changes do you mean?

Line:100, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/FileImageDescriptor.java -> what does that mean?

Line:108, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/FileImageDescriptor.java -> why do you need to use the BufferedInputStream here?

Line:151, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/FileImageDescriptor.java -> can you clean up this?

Line:15, /COMMIT_MSG -> No, assume the simple case with one icon and two resolutions (16x16, 32x32), the current scheme would require the following files:
16x16/icon.png
16x16/icon@x1.5.png (actually 24x24px)
16x16/icon@x2.png (actually 32x32px)
32x32/icon.png
32x32/icon@x1.5.png (actually 48x48px)
32x32/icon@x2.png (actually 64x64px)

in total 6 icons are used where one is duplicate, in general one requires (3*icon count)*resolutions icons.

Alternative sceme:
16x16/icon.png
24x24/icon.png
32x32/icon.png
48x48/icon.png
64x64/icon.png

in total 5 icons, no duplication, of course here it doesn't make much difference, but as described the more icons and the more resolutions it rapidly increases.

For example if I want 24x24 as another resolution I must add 3 new files in the first case and just one (36x36) in the later.

Line:23, /COMMIT_MSG -> Just assume I want a zoom-factor of 3 I need to add special support to Jface that it can handle a @x3.png files... Or I might want only 0.5 zomm and so on...

Line:100, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/FileImageDescriptor.java -> As this was not added by me I have no clue 😕 sounds like some legacy information.

Line:108, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/FileImageDescriptor.java -> The original code used this and I have not checked if there is any reason for this. I can remove this if you think its better of course.
