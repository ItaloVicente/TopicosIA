Two things: 1) trivial changes do not need to have a long explanation of the change. Your change is not trivial. 2) Most platform commits are unfortunately not a good example for good commit messages.  This depends on personal attitude and project policy that allows that. 

See JGit project for the opposite example: https://git.eclipse.org/r/q/project:jgit%252Fjgit+status:merged. All non trivial commits have a clear explanation of the change. This is the difference mostly caused by the fact that most jgit contributors are coming either from Google or SAP or simply share the same attitude, and during the review there you will be also almost always asked for that. In platform you are happy already if you could get someone to review at all.

So you've asked me for a review, and so I did. *I* personally expect a well documented git message that explains the algorithm that is changed, if the change is not trivial. From my maintenance background I believe the well documented git history is the best documentation source you can get. Neither bug tracker not review system are so convenient and easy to use as git blame.
