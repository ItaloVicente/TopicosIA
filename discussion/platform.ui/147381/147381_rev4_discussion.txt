DESCRIPTION:

Bug 549802 - Fix TestStatusHandler and re-enable tests

TestStatusHandler was registered for the product org.eclipse.sdk.ide.
This is unreliable, because the product is not used on the build server.

Instead, don't register the handler, but use some small Reflection trick
to inject the handler into StatusManager's cache on-demand.

This also gets the WizardsStatusHandlingTestCase working again.

Ideally we would test the contract of the contribution including xml. Is there no product during tests, only application? Is there only a way to contribute status handler to the product and not to an application?

I haven't found a reliable way, no.

A default handler can only be set using a product binding.

I think this reflection approach is better than not having these tests run at all.

In the end, we don't really care which StatusHandler is used. We just want to test that the Command / Wizard has called the StatusManager. So cutting off after that is fine IMHO and is more unit-test-like. We don't have to run through all the status handler extension point code, also.

I see.
Line:3828, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/plugin.xml -> Can we leave the handler definition "as is" and *comment out* handler product binding with an explanation why?
Just thinking about if someone searches where the extension point is used.

Line:3828, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/plugin.xml -> I'd rather have this comment in the TestStatusHandler javadoc than in some XML comment.

Also, I explicitly made TestStatusHandler's constructor private so that it cannot be used declaratively in plugin.xml.

Line:3828, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/plugin.xml -> OK, this way would be OK too.
