DESCRIPTION:

Bug 549898 - Opening "Customize perspective" hides toolbar items

Do not try to mimic the toolbar structure in the CPD, instead use the E4 model to populate the CPD.
Make the E4 model complete by populating all legacy actionsets into the model.

This prevents that that CPD steals model elements from the E4 model, and any tool item can be showed and hidden now.

Good news: after CPD dialog is used, the toolbar is not changed in a wrong way.

However, the bad news: just starting with the new code reveals lot of buttons that shouldn't be shown at all, and all the buttons disabled in CPD are still visible and enabled on the toolbar.
Line:879, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> I assume this caused the "explosion" of buttons in my test workspace on startup. I see buttons I've never seen before or disabled before (git, debug, working set).

Line:880, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> Why this?

Additionally, CPD shows many actions now twice in the toolbar part (debug, launch, editor presentation, navigate sections)

@Rolf: on the bug you've mentioned some quick fix - can you push your proposal as Gerrit, because this one looks like a "no-go" in the current state.

In my tests I see no duplication of menu items. Do you see the same issue on a clean workspace?
Line:880, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> This is needed to get all test-cases passed. And this should hide all buttons as well.

The quick fix is checking the parent in reconcile in ToolbarManagerRenderer, out of my head:
if (item == null && item.getParent != (Object)container) {

Then a new model element will be created.
However this will mess up the internal administration of the ToolbarManager, I did not investigate how to handle that.

A similar check is in CoolbarManager, adding the check in one of the places seem to resolve the issue.

Only tonight I can look further into this issue, I still have my normal job to work on.

Does it work for you if you remove the getActionPresentation().clearActionSets() line?

Yes, in both (old/new workspace). I run Eclipse from IDE with almost all Platform and EGit + JGit projects.

Interestingly & surprisingly, yes. 
I'm going to the lunch now, after that I can do some more testing.

I don't see *immediate* regression on my smoke tests in the IDE if I remove this line. It looks good from both workbench UI / CPD point of view (without debugging what the model does and if it is broken or not). I don't see duplicates, I don't see missing / extra buttons, I can enable/disable buttons via CPD and they also stay disabled/enabled after restart.

Rolf, can I push your patch without this line, to see which tests are affected?
