DESCRIPTION:

Bug 549898 - Opening "Customize perspective" hides toolbar items

Do not try to mimic the toolbar structure in the CPD, instead use the E4
model to populate the CPD.
Make the E4 model complete by populating all legacy actionsets into the
model.

This prevents that that CPD steals model elements from the E4 model, and
any tool item can be showed and hidden now.

Of course if one needs it, Jenkins doesn't run builds anymore :-(
I've pinged Alex to check what is wrong there.

Rolf, I would like to merge this. 
It is definitely better as before, CPD works, and if it breaks something that we are not aware of ... we have RC1 :-).
Any objections?

I've played a bit with adding action items to the toolbar, the only issue I observed was:

Re-use an old workspace (my Eclipse build was from a month ago), add an action set item (AnyEdit "color all white spaces in editors"). This then was shown to the right of "skip all breakpoints" (which is at the left part of the main toolbar after the first restart).

Normally the button appears somewhere to the right of most toolbar buttons, this is also the case when I start in a fresh workspace.

I didn't see other problems (other than the debug toolbar being somewhere else on the first start, which is a known problem and is not fixed yet).

Also the status bar (the line at the button) items are to the left when I open a new window, but this seems to be the case also before the regression this change should be fixing. So this is unrelated to this ticket; we'll open a bug at some point.
