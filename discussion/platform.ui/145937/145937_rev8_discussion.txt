You don't need to add @since on methods that already exists. @since is only to be added to new public or protected fields and methods.

What I meant is that you need to implement a similar logic for searchPreviousCell: when there is no "ABOVE", then iterate BELOW to return the last cell.

Ok, I now understand why API Tools complain.
Adding a field to a public interface is usually breaking backward compatibility: see https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs_2#Evolving_API_interfaces_-_API_fields > Evolving API Classes > Add API field.
So before we can merge it, you need to ask the PMC for approval to this addition.
Please send a mail to platform-dev@eclipse.org and eclipse-pmc@eclipse.org linking to this Gerrit, related bugzilla, and explaining why you want to add that field. Once it's approved, we'll figure out how to make API Tools stop complaining.

Didn't check but I would expect that it suggests to bump the version to 4.0.0. A filter will have to be added.

@Andrew: Dani approved it, so feel free to continue with this one.
Before merging we need:
* Support for searchPreviousCell (case of Alt+Tab)
* API Tools happinness: just adding an API Filter, no need to change the version.
