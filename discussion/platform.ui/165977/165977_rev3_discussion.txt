This does not fix the issue. After the fix also I see the icons from behind the stack.

I was only able to reproduce the case on a new model (i.e. -clearPersistedState), that issue was solved by this patch.
For reproduction: when do you see the issue? Always, or only the first time you start, etc.

Ok, I confirm that after clearing configuration and the fix, I can't reproduce the problem. But that means user can not use old workspaces.

At least this gives suffient context to start searching why it is not yet fixed for old workspaces. Probably the visibility attribute is incorrect in the old persisted workspace models, and it is not updated when loading the model.

I vote for merging now (but I can't reproduce). 
Workbench reset once is lesser evil compared to spooky buttons appearing randomly.

I am fine with releasing this fix and then work towards fixing the existing workspace issue.
