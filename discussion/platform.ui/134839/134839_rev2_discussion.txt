DESCRIPTION:

Bug 543294 Only use StackParts belonging to the current area when
creating
a CTabFolder

When deciding to move the area's composite to a CTabFolder (due to
multiple stacks being created under the area) only consider Stacks that
are directly part of that area, or to SashContainers under it. But not
Stacks that are members of possibly CompositeParts inside that area.

Line:217, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/AreaRenderer.java -> why not private? it is only used by the private method synchCTFState.

I would place the new method below synchCTFState.

I don't get really why the findElements() method does not what you need here. Both do a recursive search for MPartStack in areaModel.

Maybe EModelServiceFindTest could be extended to check your use case?

I can change that, I think I'm just used to creating protected methods for later overriding

The difference is that the findElements() method will not stop and then consume all PartStacks under an area, including ones under MCompositeParts which should belong to the part (Consider an Editor created as a Composite of several parts which are contained ín a stack). The new method will only navigate down if the element is a MPartSashContainer, which mean it is an element of the original area that was created by either adding an initial editor or dragging an editor to a side.

I'll try to update the patchset (Probably on Monday) with the modifications.

Sorry for the delay, I didn't get the chance to visit the topic again. I have a local change with 2 of the suggested changes (protected->private and the method location). I unfortunatly won't be able to submit a test for it would that be OK? I am trying to submit it the new patchset now but I am having problems since I'm on a new PC sorry :)
