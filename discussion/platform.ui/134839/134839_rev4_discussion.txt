DESCRIPTION:

Bug 543294 Only use StackParts belonging to the current area when
creating a CTabFolder

When deciding to move the area's composite to a CTabFolder (due to
multiple stacks being created under the area) only consider Stacks that
are directly part of that area, or to SashContainers under it. But not
Stacks that are members of possibly CompositeParts inside that area.

Ghaith, thanks. e4 model tests are located in the package org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests.workbench in the plug-in. I think adding a test should be easy, look for example at MPartSashContainerTest.java

I did not really look into this renderer. Non the less, I do have some concerns, see comment.
Line:218, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/AreaRenderer.java -> There are two more calls to findElements in the AreaRender, both in methods only called from sychCTFState.
Shouldn't they also be updated? Or could the stacks be passed as parameter to these methods?
