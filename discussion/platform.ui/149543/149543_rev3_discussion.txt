I don't think the guards should be removed. With Java 9+ it is recommended to use canAccess(). Since we are still on Java 8 we can't use the method. Instead I think the warning should be supressed until isAccessible() can be replaced by canAccess(Object).

Morning Karsten,

It's good to have someone to discuss this with!

> I don't think the guards should be removed.

This is actually how I did it in the production code (BeanPropertyHelper and BeanPropertyListenerSupport).

And I think this is the way we want to keep doing it, even in Java 9+.

The thing with trySetAccessible is that it returns false instead of throwing in some cases. My understanding is that this is *not* what we want in this case. It's better to through, and have the exception caught in the surrounding try-statement.

And it's also preferable for us to check the simple `isAccessible` flag first, to avoid doing extra SecurityManager checks.

But these are pretty weakly held opinions. We could just switch to tryAccessible in 9; the difference is pretty tiny.

In the (weird) example class DuckType on the other can I just removed the guard for simplicity. The only difference the guard makes in the avoid doing extra SecurityManager checks, and that's not an issue in the examples.

Oh boy, it got too late yesterday. I overlooked the helper method and focused only on the guard removal. And the docs of setAccessible() are quite clear.

So this is fine for me now.

Could you please rebase? Seems that this needs to be done manually.
