I didn't actually do anything useful here :)  Simply because I don't have experience with plugins

I posted a comment in the code review, don't know if you see it as it's marked as 'draft'.

here it is : 
"the way dark theme discovery is done seems brittle to me. Any way to transfer responsability to the ITheme ? like theme.isDarkTheme() ? 

As long as there is only 2 types of themes (light & dark) it should be ok."
Line:42, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.swt.win32/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/swt/internal/win32/DarkThemeProcessor.java -> the way dark theme discovery is done seems brittle to me. Any way to transfer responsability to the ITheme ? like theme.isDarkTheme() ? 

As long as there is only 2 types of themes (light & dark) it should be ok.

In my project, we have a UIUtils class that has an isDarkTheme() function call.  It's implementation is basic and naive, themeName.contains("dark") more or less not advocating this implementation, but I am advocating the API.
