The change is too big. Please don't include unrelated formatting changes.

Also, it's good practice to separate bundle version updates from the real change in case one wants to cherry-pick the real fix.

Dani, I was fiddeling with the commit for the version number. 

To make it separately I need a another Gerrit review with the increase of the version number and to update this one to depend on the other.

As the @since tag would depend on the version increase, it would be hard to cherry-pick it without the version increase and I assumed that the version increase would not be helpful to cherry-pick. But I can separate the changes, I only wanted to point out that I don't think it will be useful.

If the "real" change would be cherry-picked for a backport, then the minor version would not be increased, the @since tag would stay as is and an API Tools problem filter would be added.

Given it is unlikely we backport this, let's keep the version together with the change for now.

Dani, I read your comment that the change is OK. I wait a few more days before I apply it to master in case you still want to review the change in detail.
