DESCRIPTION:

Bug 548640 - Make generatedElements and sharedElements thread safe

A potential ConcurrentModificationException might occur during startup
when toolbar contributions are added to the application model while
updateVisibility() is called from a different thread.

To avoid this the collection fields generatedElements and sharedElements
are made thread safe by using CopyOnWriteArrayList/CopyOnWriteArraySet.
CopyOnWriteArraySet can be used here since the number of elements is low
(starting platform showed 2 elements), so backing by an array is no
problem here.
