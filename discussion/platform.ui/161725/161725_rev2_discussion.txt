Ah, I see. That makes the most part of my comments irrelevant, but it does not improve the platform code quality :)

Can we have a separation between what we ported "as is" and what we probably would like to have?
I suggest to move "drop-in-replacement" to "org.eclipse.jface.notifications.mylyn" package to underline its origin and reserve "org.eclipse.jface.notifications" package for the new API. WDYT?

Lets first finish this move before we change /improve it. This task started already several times and never got finished.

+1 for marking the new API as provisional so that we can adjust.

The killer argument :)

+1 for provisional API or any other solution that can allow us to change it without major version increment.

Do you have a good example as blue-print?
