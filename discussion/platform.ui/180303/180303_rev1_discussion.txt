Thanks for the patch Christoph! This would be nice to get fixed.

I will try to look at it a bit more during the weekend.

Can you also create a test for this code in this file?

/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/observable/list/WritableListTest.java

If would have time for it and want to be a real hero of Eclipse it would also be good to have WritableSet and WritableMap fixed!
Line:309, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/list/WritableList.java -> This operation takes linear time in the length of the list.

Do you think it is worth the trouble to instead save the index of the current element in a field in the iterator?

Same thing for other places where `indexOf` is used.

Line:355, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/list/WritableList.java -> I think you can return `wrappedIterator.previousIndex()` here, to avoid the call to `indexOf`.

Same thing in other places there `indexOf` is used.

I could try if I can find some more time for this the next days, this was just a "quick-fix" to get it at least working for basic cases (remove/sort).
Line:309, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/list/WritableList.java -> I just "copied" that from the WL.remove() it seems the index is required for the ListDiff ... maybe it would even be possible to simply use listIterator here... I'll check this.

Line:309, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/list/WritableList.java -> Ah, using ListIterator to implement the iterator method seems like a good idea! Then the index is available there.

I'm sorry Christoph that I couldn't help you with this problem. Lately I have had a little more time and energy so maybe we can do something about it.
