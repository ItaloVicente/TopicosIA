I'm +1 for the idea behind this change: it'll increase consistency with the default GTK3 dark theme colors, and it'll darken the dark theme (which is something I've been meaning to do myself).

With that being said, there are some issues I see with this change so far:

- It's a lot harder to see which tab is the active tab, which is a usability decrease IMO. However, https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=563496 could fix this ;)

- There are many parts of the IDE that are no longer (or incorrectly) being styled, such as dialogs and the preference pages.
Line:19, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark_linux.css -> I'm pretty sure these imports are important. I believe they style things such as the preference page, dialogs, etc.

Yes, that looks good. I too feel the same but I tried to use same colors
as Adwaita-dark. I will give it a try.

I don't see any issue with dialogs or preference pages. They all look good. See the screencast I attached to bug report.
Line:19, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark_linux.css -> I don't see any issues with dialogs or prefernce page. They all look good. Have you tried this patch?

Sounds good :)

I did try out the patch and got a lot of things not being styled correctly. I can revisit it to see if something is wrong with my workspace... @Lars & Andrey, can you confirm that the dialogs and preferences look styled?

No, this depends on Bug 563001. You can still try without that patch by starting eclipse with `GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark ./eclipse` to force Display use correct system colors.

No, that's because of a related bug 563001. You can test with `GTK_THEME=Adwaita:dark` environment set to force Display to use correct system colors. Or test with Adwaita-dark as your desktop theme.
