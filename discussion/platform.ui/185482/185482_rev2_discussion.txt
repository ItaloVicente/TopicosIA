I always look in the history of the touched files for the common pattern and take that. The used pattern is either Bug header and then including the bug files or separate version update without bug header. If you want to change that it would help to get consensus with all committers of the prefered style instead of forcing your (JDT) style.

Honestly, how complicated it is to simply follow the simple rules?
It is not my style, it is project style, and nothing need to be changed.

Please avoid such comments, to me and most like to others this sound not friendly.

I don't think we have fixed rules for the version update commit. IMHO it is in most cases not related to a certain bug, as it is necessary for all changes for a release. If you think you should define a fixed rule for version increases, let me know, I can bring it up to the PMC.

Commit message looks fine to me. I personally prefer the "Not with bug reference style in the header" style and only with a link to the bug in the commit message but this commit message style is also used by many.

Andrey, the updated message is fine for you too?
