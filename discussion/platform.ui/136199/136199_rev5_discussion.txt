Rolf, any recommendation how to test this manually? My runtime behaves fine AFAICS but these changes used to to trigger evil bugs.

Not sure how to test this manually. But at least by now the menu test cases are enabled again, see gerrit https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/138903/.
How many of the evil bugs are covered by theses tests is unknown though.

Basically, this change makes the workaround from time-based to state-based, i.e. update is only really executed when the menu is visible. So ask anybody running with the work-around if they experienced problems.

Finally, in case that the update is forced, it is not delayed reducing the likelihood to introduce unwanted side effects.
