IIRC (I also made this mistake a few times before), the rule in that case is to not revert and keep moving forward, as version bumps are not too much of a big deal and a version decrease can cause a lot of mess.

As long as the revert is before the official build it should be fine. So if that revert is for 140959 a revert today should be fine.

I leave it to Karsten to decide

In this case we should not revert.
