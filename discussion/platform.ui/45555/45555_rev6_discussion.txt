Dirk, can you please test this fix on Windows? I still only have Linux.

I commented on the ticket and attached a screenshot for simply setting the background to red. It doesn't look correct there, but maybe I'm doing something wrong or missing some setting. Would be great if you could give me some feedback on this so I can test this again.

Hi Dirk, thanks for taking a look at it... this was really an issue when the Table had the MULTI selection style. I just added a new patch which should solve that.
