Ok, using composition instead of subclassing so that on the future it's more flexible to customize other widgets.

I've answered your other questions through comments in the code and added the possibility of customizing the selection foreground too.

Also, I've made the patch apply the colors only on windows. Theoretically there should be nothing wrong with it on other platforms, but in practice the latest SWT seems to have broken the EraseItem painter on Linux (i.e.: even on LiClipse where that worked properly it doesn't anymore with the changes in Eclipse 4.5), so, at this stage I believe going Windows-only is the only viable solution (I don't have time to delve into SWT and see why it broke right now -- from my experiments it seems that listeners for SWT.EraseItem which paint a background will not work properly anymore -- at least not on Ubuntu 12.04, which is where I tested).

If I do get time before M7 is released I might fix that in another bug, but I'd like to at least have this fixed for Windows for now.

This change will have to wait until 4.6, since we are past the API freeze. This will also give you time to make sure it works on all platforms.

I only looked at the package names which indicate API. But those packages are not declared API in the manifest. Hence can still go in, but only for M7, which is our feature freeze.

Sure... waiting from feedback from Lars and Brian then -- hoping to integrate before M7 is closed :)

Fabio, can you please report this issue with SWT, it think that needs to get fixed before 4.6.

Just did: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=464816 (although as I said, it should probably not block this one... when that is fixed I can create a new one to move the related css from windows to linux -- and check if there's still some other tweak needed in the erase listener itself).
