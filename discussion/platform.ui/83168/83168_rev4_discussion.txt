Very nice IMHO. Please send an email to Platform UI asking for feedback on this change. As this is highly visible we should ask for opinions.

Even though there may still be some debate about whether to enable this for the default themes or not, would there be value in merging Simon's code contributions without the CSS changes so that custom themes can take advantage of this feature?

Andrew, I would be curious to see how your Modern Dark theme would look with a red highlighter. Maybe something worth trying?

Awesome idea :) I'll try to give it a shot this evening (if not then tomorrow or on the weekend)

Here's how it looks :) https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=282489

Personally, I think this is a welcome change to allow theme creators greater flexibility in creating themes with CSS. So +1 for that.

However, I don't think this should be used in the default themes.

The patch was quite easy to rebase, even 4 years later. If Simon is busy, I wouldn't mind resubmitting the patch but removing changes to the default themes (I will also make sure to reference him in the License headers).

Andrew, can you modify the patch so that it only highlights the selected tab of the active tab?

Sure I'll try to when I have a moment. By this you mean, only one tab in the UI (the currently selected & activate tab) should have the highlight, correct?

Can't this be achieved with the current patch using an ".active" CSS selector? Wouldn't that be more consistent with other existing properties?

No, I haven't tested the patch, however its changes to e4_basestyle.css illustrate this, and the discussions on the ticket after the patch was submitted talk about highlighting the active tab, so I'm assuming it works... :)

Can you test if that really works? If yes, I would merge this and IMHO we can activate this for the dark theme.

Hey Lars, I'll test it this evening since it seems to be a priority.
However, might I suggest we slightly modify the patch so that the highlight bar is at the top, instead of the bottom? See attachments on https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=562269 to see what this looks like (much nicer IMO)

Why not have a CSS option to let theme builders choose between top and bottom? Intellij's material theme uses a bottom highlight, and it looks great there (https://www.material-theme.com/) :)

Good point! I'm +1 for this although I'm not sure how to make a CSS boolean? Is there an example somewhere I can follow (Lars?) :)

Custom scroll-bars use "swt-scrollbar-themed: true" for example. You may want to look at org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertyStyledTextScrollbarSWTHandler.java as an example implementation.

Alternatively, that property could also simply be a pixel offset, allowing devs to precisely position the highlight vertically as they see fit.

Thanks for the tip :) I ended up going with a top/bottom boolean since the CSS theme creator won't have access to the height of the tab.

@Lars & Pierre-Yves, I made an updated version of this patch which allows the theme creator to set the highlight to the top or bottom of the tab. See https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/161627/
