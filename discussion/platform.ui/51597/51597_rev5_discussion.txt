I think the current code is on a good track, but have concerns explained inline.

Also, I do agree with Brian that the Delegation to different actions is to be preferred, as there is no strong relationship between moving a resource inside workspace (input/output are workspace paths), and moving a project on filesystem (input/output are filesystem paths). So to me, keeping both actions properly separated is cleaner and to be preferred (as it''s in current patch set 5).
Line:65, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator.resources/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/resources/actions/DelegatingSelectionListenerAction.java -> Why not always sending the PropChangeEvents to the delegate, instead of delaying them? Some listeners may make sense when property change, but not later when selection changes as some context may have disappeared in the meantime.
In general even for other actions like Rename which aren't always enabled, actions are sent anyway even for disabled actions, so maybe the delegate should always be sent all delegates anyway; and the firePropertyChange... methods should just be overriden to notify delegates directly.
