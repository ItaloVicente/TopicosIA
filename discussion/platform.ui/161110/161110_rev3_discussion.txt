Thanks for the reply. What about the height?

I was looking at the code to answer Pierre-Yves but then I ended up making further adjustments and I have yet to clean them up and push them.  All in all, this code is very sensitive because there are so many hard coded values that aren't specified anywhere.

When I do push my changes, I will be sure to post screenshots of the top and bottom tabs.

Hi Pierre-Yves!  Sorry for the delay, I finally picked this back up.  I was contemplating additional changes, but for now I think I want to move ahead with these ones.

The reason we have also affected the height (took me a minute to remember why), is that we used to be drawing a larger height than we needed to.  This is because the height of the area we are drawing isn't the whole tab area, it is offset by the height of the tab, so it's height should also be reduced by that much.
