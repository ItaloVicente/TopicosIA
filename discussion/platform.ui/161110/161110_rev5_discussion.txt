Would be nice to have updated versions of these, the ones on the bug are for older versions of the patch. I'm slightly nervous about reviewing this patch without them given that we had quite a few off by one pixels issues on the tab highlighter patch.

Sure thing!  I will get those.  Might be towards the end of the day.

Thanks! I'm currently working on a different laptop, so unfortunately I can't test things easily by checking out the patch and generating the screenshots myself :)

Does this still need a final review? What's left here? (I assume this should get in for 4.17?)

I still need to gather screenshots of round and square tabs in both top and bottom configurations since much has changed from the time where I originally posted this patch.  

I would be okay with a 4.16 or 4.17 target for this patch.

Sounds good, thanks for the update!

I'm also good for either, @Lars WDYT?

4.17 I merged already too many Gerrits short term before the release. 

If only we had more committers which could merge.... ;-)

If everything goes well, hopefully I could become an Eclipse committer in the near future!
