DESCRIPTION:

Bug 497586 - Allow to define a selection highlighter for
the selected tab

The highlight color can be set with swt-selected-tab-highlight and it's
position (top or bottom of the tab) can be set with the boolean
swt-selected-highlight-top. Note that setting
swt-selected-highlight-top: true
with rounded CTabFolder corners looks aesthetically displeasing.

Example usage in CSS:
# Set the selected tab highlight color
swt-selected-tab-highlight: white;

# Set whether the highlight should be on top or bottom of the tab
(optional, default value is true)
swt-selected-highlight-top: false;

Andrew, would it be OK to merge this early 4.17 (which is in ~2 weeks I think), so that we can test this better. Could you also open a bug to use this in the dark theme for the active stack (i.e., use this only for the view in the active stack). I think the default dark theme would benefit from this.

Patch Set 22: Code-Review-1

@Mike & everyone: I think I found the source of the issue.

The issue described by Pierre-Yves happens when the tab index is 0 (for the first tab). The way the round tab outline is calculated is slightly different for the first tab compared to the rest.

I adjusted this so there's no need for a width adjustment when drawing the highlight on round tabs. However, my code is ugly (it needs to be made nicer).

I'm not sure if we'll want to adjust the logic for the round tab outline for 4.16. If so, I can just add a special case in the highlight logic for when the tab index == 0 and > 0. That will work as well.

I would have liked to get it in for 4.16 but I can settle for 4.17 to allow further testing and whatnot.

Sorry but as we already did a big change (square tabs) in this arena I'm a bit afraid to change something here, especially if we do not yet use it ourself (so we might not note issues with it).

So two weeks more to wait. :-(

I feel quite strongly about getting this in for 4.16 for reasons outlined in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=497586#c45

The code was reviewed and tested successfully by Mike and myself for square tabs, so maybe we can merge that part of the patch (patch set 21) and get the tweaks for round tabs (patch set 22) shipped in a separate commit for 4.17?

And I feel strongly that the people who do the work make the final decision. :-)

Can you open the bug for the dark theme and activate it for the active stack via a Gerrit so that everyone interested in testing this can do it easily?

If done, I will give my +1 as project lead.

In case this is not clean: I mean Andrew, you and Mike are the people which should make the final decision here. :-)

The bug will be opened :) but please, do NOT merge this until I submit another patchset and give my +1.

I will implement a workaround that doesn't modify the round tab outline code, but works perfectly in all cases :) I just have to step out for a moment - it'll be done before 5pm EST.

Same, I'd also be glad to help if you need it.  So far, from what I've seen, I'm pretty confident that this is a good candidate for 4.16 at low risk.
