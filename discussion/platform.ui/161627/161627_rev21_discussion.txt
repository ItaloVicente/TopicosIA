DESCRIPTION:

Bug 497586 - Allow to define a selection highlighter for
the selected tab

The highlight color can be set with swt-selected-tab-highlight and it's
position (top or bottom of the tab) can be set with the boolean
swt-selected-highlight-top. Note that setting
swt-selected-highlight-top: true
with rounded CTabFolder corners looks aesthetically displeasing.

Example usage in CSS:
# Set the selected tab highlight color
swt-selected-tab-highlight: white;

# Set whether the highlight should be on top or bottom of the tab
(optional, default value is true)
swt-selected-highlight-top: false;

I would like to try and get a grip on the round tab width.  It's possibly just a call to math.round that could make the difference.  (since it's okay sometimes and not okay other times)

I suspect you're right Mike. Let us know if you find the source of the issue :)
