Awesome thanks :)
Would you mind testing out this patch with the square CTabFolder css option? Just to make sure things look good.

Otherwise, if you can, find the name of the CSS option to get square corners for CTabFolder and I'll apply it in my theme. I was using the corner radius = 6 trick, which isin't exactly square corners.

Actually setting swt-corner-radius to anything lower than 6 now renders square tabs (probably makes more sense to set 0px though). :)

I'm also not sure why the CI build failed. Lars would you mind retriggering it? Maybe it needs to be rebased
