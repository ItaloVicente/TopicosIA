@Lars, once I do the patch for allowing square/rounded tab corners in Eclipse's preferences, maybe this patch's feature should be enabled when square tabs are used?

It's just an idea, I'll have to see how square corners look in the default theme. If it's hard to see the active tab, then this patch's feature should be used IMO.

I suggest to remove the e4 part of the name, e.g. CSSPropertySelectedTabFillHandler

Sorry I'm not exactly sure I understand - could you explain more in depth or point to the code that needs to be changed?
