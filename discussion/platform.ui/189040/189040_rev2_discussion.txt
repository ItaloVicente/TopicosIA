DESCRIPTION:

WIP - Bug 577912 - Display's system colors are set to late for dark
theme during workbench startup

By moving the init code of the styling engine, editors should get the
correct color as this is (hopefully) called before their initialization.

Needs check to avoid double-initialization.

> Alois, can you check if that helps the GEF editors?

Sure. Took me a bit to get every thing set up. GEF editors are now getting the right colors. Its not super perfect as pointed out in the discussion in the bug but much better then before. 

However, with your patch when starting in dark theme I get about 6 NPEs. Will attach a txt file to the bug.
