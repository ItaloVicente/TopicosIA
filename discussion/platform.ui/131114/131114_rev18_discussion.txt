Line:29, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/IUriSchemeExtensionReader.java -> Instead of all those refactoring just to allow the test to get one specific instance (if I understood correctly), I suggest you just keep all this code as it was before your change, and just create a

  UriSchemeExtensionReader.newTestInstance()

method in UriSchemeExtnesionReader which would just be used for testing (documented as it and so on).

I'm not a fan of mixing productive with test code.
I didn't do much refactorings at the end (base <-> patch 18). It just took a while to get this solution.

The only thing I did is to remove the getInstance method from UriSchemeExtensionReader.

Anything else is pure dependency injection.

Sorry, but I'm still failing at fully understanding the refactoring. I have the feeling a simpler implementation can be reached.
See comments inline.
Line:29, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/IUriSchemeExtensionReader.java -> Why do you still need this getInstance() -which is actually a factory more than a singleton and would rather be called newInstance- instead of directly invoking "new UriSchemeExtensionReader()" ?

Line:64, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/dialogs/UriSchemeHandlerPreferencePage.java -> Basically, aren't these clasdes test code leaking into production code? It's really only useful for testing and there is no other production use-case for them.
Not trying to discourage you from doing it, though, it's more a by-the-way comment to highlight that to blur the line according to your rule of not leaking test into production ;)

Line:64, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/dialogs/UriSchemeHandlerPreferencePage.java -> I don't see test code leaking into production. Just made dependency injection possible. There is a productive and a test implementation for these interfaces.
Unfortunately I didn't found a solution to inject my own StatusManager implementation (which e.g. just records the call with all parameters instead of opening a dialog).
In general classes like StatusManager are not really test friendly (no test access or stub implementation possible!)
So I have to do it the way I did.

As a remark: I don't want to test the dialog itself (that is not my unit), I just want to test, that it was called with the right parameters.

But you are right, since it is not possible to set an own StatusManager I need to introduce new interfaces to be able to inject them.

Line:29, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/IUriSchemeExtensionReader.java -> The implementation is UriSchemeExtenstionReader ist not API.
IUriSchemeExtenstionReader is API. So we thought, it is the best place to get a productive instance of the implementation. 
It was just changed to the constructor call directly since the UriSchemeExtensionReader.getInstance() was actually not needed.

I know we have discussed about API already and you stated, that plugins of the same project (e.g. platform) can use all its internals. Does that mean other plugins can use UriSchemeExtensionReader (internal) without an export entry in the corresponding manifest?
I thought, that does not work.

And when using the constructor directly instead of the interface, the implemantation of UriSchemeExtensionReader cannot be changed. With the approach of this patch it can.
I just followed the approach of implementing against abstraction rather than concrete classes.

I'd like to avoid extra complexity, and just stick to a "new URISchemeExtensionReader()" where we can without using a factory method someplace else.
Unless we don't need complexity, we should introduce it and should actually try to get rid of it.

> Does that mean other plugins can use UriSchemeExtensionReader (internal) without an export entry in the corresponding manifest?

No, but it's also the case before your patch, so that should be a consideration for the current patch.

Line:171, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/dialogs/UriSchemeHandlerPreferencePage.java -> Because URIScehemeExtensionReader is not API and belongs to another plugin. In my opinion the preference page should not have any knowledge about concrete implementations.
I don't want to export an internal package.

This will be useful when there are other implementations, but at the moment it's far from being a pragmatic issue.

> I don't want to export an internal package.

Most if not all Platform plugin do export their internal packages and can use the x-internal and x-friends directives.
I suggest you do the same.

Mickael, I have the feeling that all the open comment are a matter of taste (see my individual answers). I suggest to accept Marcus' implementation. Is that okay for you? If I don't here any objections from your side I plan to merge this change beginning of next week.
Line:64, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/dialogs/UriSchemeHandlerPreferencePage.java -> I agree with Marcus. He just made the StatusManager testable. This has the effect, that the test can run as JUnit Test instead of a JUnit Plugin test. I find this is a huge benefit as JUnit test run much faster - build and test runtime of platform build is already long enough.

Line:171, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide.application/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/application/dialogs/UriSchemeHandlerPreferencePage.java -> Mickael, I think this is a matter of taste. Marcus implementation is not pragmatic but from my point of view it is very clean and clearly separated. I would suggest to keep it this way. Okay for you?

Line:32, bundles/org.eclipse.urischeme/src/org/eclipse/urischeme/internal/UriSchemeProcessor.java -> Yes we could do this here (because it's the same plugin). But then we have two places in the code that use two different ways to create the instance. I suggest to keep both places the same. Okay for you?

My comments are more meant to highlight that this is introducing a lot of change and complexity where it's not necessary; and that this kind of dogmatic changes over not using an internal package leads to harder maintenance.

But it's not really something I'm willing to fight strongly against here. Feel free to take care of it from here and to ignore my former comments if you find them irrelevant, I won't mind ;)
