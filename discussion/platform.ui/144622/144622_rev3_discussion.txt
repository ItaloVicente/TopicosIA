There are some errors in the test-cases, so although they are 'green' I don't think that they should be.

Furthermore, I look at org.eclipse.e4.internal.tools.wizards.model.FragmentExtractHelper, and it seems that moving existing elements to the imports would already do the trick.
Line:366, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> I think that moving the existingElements to the imports of the fragmentscontainer would result in the desired behavior. However I was not able to validate that quickly, as the test-cases are not correct yet.

File Comment: tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/data/ModelAssembler/NotExistsNonInitalPartlyMergeFragment.e4xmi -> The xmi:id's seem not related to any other element. How would the model assembler decide that this fragment is partially merged?
Line:5, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/data/ModelAssembler/fragment_initial.xml -> Typo; do these test actually test something?

Line:607, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/workbench/ModelAssemblerTests.java -> Most important is to create elements with the same XMI-ID as the elements in the fragment. Elements are compared by XMI-ID, not by element ID

Line:366, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> Imports are regularily used when an element A references another element B, and B is NOT part of the fragment. To express the ref from A to B in the fragment, a proxy of B is created in the fragment (aka import) and A referenced the proxy in the fragment. In this case, A is imported, B already exists. During the merge, the import is "resolved". That means, the merger will look for the B in the application model and then change the reference pointing from A to the proxy of B to the "real B". Your case is pretty similar, but you do not have imports already in the fragment. If A and B are part of the fragment, but B is already merged, you need to change the ref from A  to the B which already existed (in the application model). That is why you can probbaly reuse the import mechanism. Does this make sense to you?

Line:366, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> But why should I move existing elements to the Imports? After the model is merged all elements are accessable. I thougt Imports are only required for the editor not for runtime.
