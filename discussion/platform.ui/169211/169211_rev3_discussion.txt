Clearly we didn't make the deadline. I was not able to spend much time on Eclipse related work lately.

I consider this a low risk change, which is easily validated. Do we want it for RC1 or wait for 4.19?

@Alex: what's the rule here? This bug is not a regression AFAIK.

I gave it pmc_approved on the bug. So you can continue with the review and push for RC1 if pleased.
