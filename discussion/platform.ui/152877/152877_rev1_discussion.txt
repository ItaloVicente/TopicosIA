DESCRIPTION:

Bug 553089 - Avoid loading / parsing of log file in UI thread

Parsing the log file is a potential long running task depending on the
log's size. It has to be avoided that this is performed on the UI
thread, since this would block the UI when the Error View is
initialized.
The loading is performed on the common fork-join pool with a
CompletableFuture. On completion the elements and fields collections can
be resetted, filled and limited. This does not affect UI, so it can be
performed again on a free executor. Finally, the viewer is refreshed.
This is performed on the UI thread with Display#asyncExec.
While the log is loaded the content description shows the message
"Loading..." now, which gets replaced with the appropriate title when
reading is complete.

Refactoring: Remove synchronization on fields 'elements' and 'groups' by
changing them to CopyOnWriteArrayList and ConcurrentHashMap.

Refactoring: Change return type of AbstractEntry#getChildren to the more
concrete type AbstractEntry. This leads to a refactoring of
dateComparator in LogView#limitEntriesCount.

For testing: Set a breakpoint or a Thread.sleep in LogView#readLogFile in line 865. The view should be shown, with disabled filter field. and UI is not blocked. When reading was finished, the view is populated and the filter field is enabled.
