DESCRIPTION:

Bug 553089 - Avoid loading / parsing of log file in UI thread

Parsing the log file is a potential long running task depending on the
log's size. It has to be avoided that this is performed on the UI
thread, since this would block the UI when the Error View is
initialized.
The loading is performed on the common fork-join pool with a
CompletableFuture. On completion the elements and fields collections can
be resetted, filled and limited. This does not affect UI, so it can be
performed again on a free executor. Finally, the viewer is refreshed.
This is performed on the UI thread with Display#asyncExec.
While the log is loaded the content description shows the message
"Loading..." now, which gets replaced with the appropriate title when
reading is complete.

Refactoring: Remove synchronization on fields 'elements' and 'groups' by
changing them to CopyOnWriteArrayList and ConcurrentHashMap.

Refactoring: Change return type of AbstractEntry#getChildren to the more
concrete type AbstractEntry. This leads to a refactoring of
dateComparator in LogView#limitEntriesCount.

Thanks, Karsten. Looks good. I used this Gerrit today in my Eclipse RCP training to explain how to sync with the display thread.

To improve readability I suggest to move the applyAsync and thenApply statements into a private method and call the method. This should result in a 1-2 liner which is much easier to parse.

Line:880, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> I'm not sure if getTitleSummary may cause disk access (it involves some stuff about log files). Therefore I would extract that to a local variable before the asyncExec.

Line:951, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> On first glance, the comparator looks like it can be replaced by

 Comparator.comparing(LogEntry::getDate, Comparator.nullsLast((d1, d2) -> d1.before(d2) ? -1 : 1));

I'm just not sure how to add the instanceof check into the call.

Line:961, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> wrong indentation (it's closing of the top level if, not the else). in egit we have made braces mandatory for control flow statements in the autosave formatter (on changed lines only) to avoid such confusion. maybe we should do that in platform, too?

Good idea
Line:880, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> good catch!

I found that readFile() might be called from the Equinox Log Thread. This makes it necessary to set the 'Loading' label on the UI thread.
