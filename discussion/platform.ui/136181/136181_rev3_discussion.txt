DESCRIPTION:

Bug 530450 - [Project Explorer] UI Freeze with nested projects

Change in marker used to trigger a refresh of the viewer, while an
element update should be invoked instead.
So we removed the code cascading markers changes to refresh from
NestedProjectContentProvider.
Instead, we made the NestedProjectsLabelProvider taking care of
listening to marker changes and reacting by updating its internal model.
Then, since the Label Provider doesn't have a reference to the viewer,
we made the contentprovider register itself for updates to the
labelprovider so the later invokes an updates of modified elements in
the viewer after its internal marker model updates.

@Andrey: we have some users ready to give feedback but who'd first need an I-Build. Please tell me whenever you think it's good to be shipped for merge and manual testing from the bug followers.

On question : AFAIK "nested" content is not enabled by default. Does it matter here?

I'm not sure if I understand it. So the changes on the nested* types aren't necessary for the fix? Can we move them to another commit then? If I read it right, the ResourceExtensionContentProvider change is a revert to the previous state, isn't?

If we don't update the other Nested* stuff, then the markers do not propagate to parent in nested view and that's a regression too (there are unit tests on this topic).

Not really.

Yes.
The NestedProjectsContentProvider now has the responsibility of enabling problem decoration propagation, by registering the viewer as "updated" by the NestedProjectLabelProvider on marker changes.

Again, if the Nested* stuff is not enabled by default, how does it help for ResourceExtensionContentProvider?

ResourceExtensionContentProvider is always enabled, and contained the code that was triggering extra useless refresh.
But this logic should have gone to Nested* in the 1st place. The change moves the logic from ResourceExtensionContentProvider to NestedProjectsContentProvider/NestedProjectsLabelProvider, and replace the refresh() by an update().

That was clear.

which aren't enabled by default?

Can you point me where the update() is? In the Nested* code? How ResourceExtensionContentProvider works with that code if it is not enabled by default?

May be I have silly questions, but I'm not really in the business of  the "common navigator" API, so I have very vague understanding how it works.

Right.

NestedProjectsLabelProvider, line 83.

I'm not sure what specifically you mean by "work", but the propagation of error markers to parent projects isn't required in Flat layout because relying directly with resource.findMarkers(...) like it's done in ResourceExtensionLabelProvider is enough to get the maximal severity to display.
In Nested mode, we use another ContentProvider that takes care of showing the hierarchy of projects, and the LabelProvider takes care of listening to marker changes to propagate to parent projects and resources.

> May be I have silly questions,

I've heard sillier things ;)
