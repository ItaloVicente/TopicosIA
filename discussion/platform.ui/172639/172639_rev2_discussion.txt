DESCRIPTION:

Bug 566172 - HandlerActivationTest is unstable

HandlerProcessingAddon is only weakly connected to the context,
therefore it can be garbage collected which makes the tests fail.
Adding all the created instances explicitly to the context, to prevent
them from being garbage collected.

Great catch, Rolf! Was this causing the intermittent build failures that we were seeing?

Yes, basically the HandlerProcessingAddon got removed during the tests, which disabled the installation of new handlers as a whole. Which logically resulted in the failures.
