DESCRIPTION:

Bug 560027 - Copy/Paste during inline-rename in Project Explorer doesn't
work

Copy/paste does not work because KeyBindingDispatcher swallows the key
event because it can find and execute the key bindings Ctrl+C and
Ctrl+V.
Even worse, the key binding actions are applied to the selected
resource, which is inline renamed at the moment, and not the inline text
widget.

This fix disables the processing of key bindings while inline rename is
active. The unfortunate consequence is that no keybindings work at all
while inline rename is performed. E.g. Alt+F11 to toggle fullscreen.

Hey Paul, thanks for investigating this bug further and coming up with a fix :) 
Did you check out Thomas' proposed solution here https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=560027#c11 ?

He suggests setting up a TextActionHandler for the CNF, this TextActionHandler would then be passed to the RenameResourceAction which can associate the TextActionHandler with the text widget that appears during the inline rename. This TextActionHandler would then determine if a command should be run (such as copying a file for the project explorer) or if the widget action (text copy) should occur.

I can try to provide you with more info (eg. code line examples of how TextActionHandler was used in the old navigator) if you wanna go down this route.

In terms of this current patch, I'm glad to see you found a nice and short fix. Since it has the side-effect of disabling all keybindings during inline rename, I think it might be worth investigating how to intercept only the cut, copy, paste and delete commands. However others might be OK with your current solution.

Also just food for thought: I encountered this same issue with my own RCP app but ended up coming up with my own fix that didn't involve TextActionHandler https://github.com/AObuchow/Sample-Commander/commit/12893a2a3d6fba585a3448fb6aed702869279b59#diff-161bc451ab15c32f5dc0ba1016a04a58R267. However, I don't think the solution I used would work as easily for RenameResourceActionHandler due to the increased complexity.

Not yesterday but found some time to look into it.

This TextActionHandler would then determine if a command should be run (such as copying a file for the project explorer) or if the widget action (text copy) should occur.

I had skimmed over that but had not understand it enough until now. I made a possible fix including TextActionHandler which works as desired but I still need to check for unwanted consequences. You can count this change as almost abandoned.

https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui/+/169753 is probably a better fix for the same problem.
