DESCRIPTION:

Bug 553833 - [Tests] Move o.e.jface.tests.databinding.conformance to
JUnit4

To keep the current direction of the dependency
o.e.jface.tests.databinding to o.e.jface.tests.databinding.conformance,
a custom two-step parameterized runner was build. The first step
collects all the conformance tests by using the existing method
addConformanceTest and the second step instantiates each test class with
the given delegate as constructor argument.

This change looks good to me. I only have a few minor points to discuss.

One thing I would like have looked in to, but I unfortunately don't have the time, is this: that all classes still have same `XxxContractTest` run for them. I trust that you have been careful about that! 

I also made some explanatory comments on the new methods and class. I'll push them directly to this change, I hope that's okay.
Line:111, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/databinding/BindingTestSuiteJunit3.java -> Should we change the name of this class, now that it is no longer a JUnit 3 suite?

The current name also seems misleading because the tests are not related to the binding action and the `Binding` class.

Maybe this class could be `ConformanceSuite`, and the new class that is called `ConformanceSuite` could be `TestCollection`?

Line:196, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/databinding/BindingTestSuiteJunit3.java -> Why is this method override necessary?

I understand that it makes the annotation array always empty, but why?

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:196, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/databinding/BindingTestSuiteJunit3.java -> The overridden method creates an array with the number of annotations minus 1 and because the test classes in the conformance bundle don't have any class annotations this would result in an array of length -1. Added a comment in the code as well.
