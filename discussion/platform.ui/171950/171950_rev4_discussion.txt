DESCRIPTION:

Bug 553833 - [Tests] Move o.e.jface.tests.databinding.conformance to
JUnit4

To keep the current direction of the dependency
o.e.jface.tests.databinding to o.e.jface.tests.databinding.conformance,
a custom two-step parameterized runner was build. The first step
collects all the conformance tests by using the existing method
addConformanceTest and the second step instantiates each test class with
the given delegate as constructor argument.

> One thing I would like have looked in to, but I unfortunately don't have the time, is this: that all classes still have same `XxxContractTest` run for them. I trust that you have been careful about that! 

Yes. Whereever possible the conformance test classes extend a XxxContractTest. Where this was not possible (due to multiple inheritance not possible in Java), I added a second test to the TestCollection in the addConformanceTests method. 

> I also made some explanatory comments on the new methods and class. I'll push them directly to this change, I hope that's okay.
Forgot to rebase my change in changeset 3. Please see changeset 4 directly, which includes the comments.
