What does the line mean that is shown in gerrit as right border? Is it possible to change it to the real page limit? i think I have seen different formatting in my trys to use eclipse formatting to solve issues. E.g. Regarding newline after parameter in javadoc. Maybe in a different project. Have to check that. Is there a common standard?

Not sure what you are asking. We should always use the Eclipse formatter which should be set as project properties

And as said, we do not simply reformat everything only if outdated formatting is harmful to contributions, it is OK to format IMHO.
