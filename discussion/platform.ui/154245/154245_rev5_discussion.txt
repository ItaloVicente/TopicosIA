> I suggest to add another type LabelProviderBuilder instead of new
 > static methods at LabelProvider

I agree a builder class would fit the purpose however:

- It might reduce discoverability as users are already using LabelProvider and are likely to encounter the new static functions when using content-assist 

- A similar pattern already is being used for Selection Listener, see https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.swt/blob/57c7b63cd7ec20d84e1a8bb636d49f7f74def063/bundles/org.eclipse.swt/Eclipse%20SWT/common/org/eclipse/swt/events/SelectionListener.java#L80

- I could not find any other builder classes for JFace Viewers (this is the weakest argument however, as it could be a good trend to start)

I'm open to the idea of adding a builder class but might need some arguments in favour of it.

Also can someone please verify that the test cases I added are appropriate? In particular, the testLabelProviderImageAdapter.

Additionally, the test cases could probably be renamed now that I've changed the static function names.

+1 for having the methods in the LabelProvider type itself.
It is not really a builder pattern. At least not a complex one. I do not see any benefit of having a separate type. But only the drawback that people might overlook it.

I'd suggest to have a plain unit test for the table provider.
1. Call the method with the function to create a label provider
2. call getText(Object element) and getImage...
3. assert they are equal to the one from the function

Simple unit test which runs quick. Though with the image it might be difficult to run that headless as a plain unit test. Not sure...

My idea of builder was to provide a fluent style decoration for creating LabelProvider that can accept functions for each method and has a default LabelProvider implementation as a fallback

LabelProviders.defaults().forText(textFunction).forImage(imageFunction).create();

I think this pattern can be nice in more complex cases. But for dead simple utilities like this one I think it only gets in the way.

+1 for methods directly on LabelProvider.

Other than that, I'm fine with the change. Maybe we can get another change for ColumnLabelProvider?

Anyone still having objections or can be merge this one?

With the added public static methods LabelProvider now deserves its own unit tests. Let's extract it to the separate compilation unit.

No objection.

That sounds good.

A reflection about these kinds of changes in general:

Adding similar methods to ColumnLabelProvider and other relevant places is important!

Because it is important for the quality of the API that improvements are made in a structured, regular way. Otherwise, in the long run the API will become confusing and hard to understand.

Agree. If we decided to add static factory methods to LabelProvider - it should be done for every related place in API like ColumnLabelProvider - for developer satisfaction.

I'm trying to apply better OOP that should not accept any static keyword - this is why suggested to use another type to decorate LabelProvider creation. 
However, I do understand that any API change should should not have style conflict with the surrounding API. And this is why I can live with another portion of static methods added to the old good JFace. 

My minor suggestion is to extract unit tests for LabelProvider to another file. But this is not blocking one and can be done later.

This sounds like an any interesting idea, it would be interesting to discuss it in another forum, I think I would strongly disagree with it. :)

Agreed. I started working on the change for ColumnLabelProvider. The issue I ran into was trying to retrieve a model element from the Column itself for testing. It doesn't seem like there's any obvious "getItem" method for ColumnViewer or Column. Once I resolve this, the patch should be good for a merge (after final review).

Agreed. I created a dedicated class for this however I haven't pushed the change yet as I need to figure out how to properly test ColumnLabelProvider.
