Awesome, Andrew, thanks for your fast implementation. Looks good to me<. 

I will add a few people which typically have good ideas about method naming so that we can decide if the current method names are good.

What about unit test?
Line:34, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/LabelProvider.java -> Is it worth to have a method for with both lambdas?
public static LabelProvider getTextAdapter(Function<Object, String> textFunction, Function<Object, Image> imageFunction);

I think so.

Hello Andrew,

I think these convenience methods are a good idea, and will be helpful for many people.

I have a couple of suggestions, mostly about style things.
Line:63, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/LabelProvider.java -> I don't think the text reads really well. How about something like this:

Creates a {@link LabelProvider} which implements the {@link #getText} method by calling the argument function.

Same thing for the other method.

Line:68, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/LabelProvider.java -> A small sentence would be better:

@return the new label provider

Same thing for the other method.

Line:71, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/LabelProvider.java -> I don't thing names that stat with `get` is suitable here. I think `createTextProvider` is a good name.

I feel strongly that if a method is called `getXXX` then it will return something that already exists.

Line:71, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/LabelProvider.java -> I think it should have a longer name. For example: textProvider

Same thing for the other method.

Line:72, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/LabelProvider.java -> You should guard against null arguments by adding this line before the return statement:


Objects.requireNonNull(f);
return new LabelProvider() { ...

Same thing for the other method.

Line:89, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/viewers/LabelProvider.java -> createImageProvider?

Working on adding a unit test, and I added a method to support both getText and getImage with lambda.

Thank you very much for the feedback Jens! I agree with all of it, will add them into the patch.

I suggest to add another type LabelProviderBuilder instead of new static methods at LabelProvider
