DESCRIPTION:

Bug 541047 - Bad performance due to redundant visibleWhen calculations
of toolbar contributions

Avoid scheduling a separate RunAndTrack for each individual toolbar
contribution in ToolBarManagerRenderer#processAddition.

In situations where a lot of context modifications happen, e.g. closing
and opening of editors, this can cause hundreds and thousands of
redundant update calls to the handlers' visibility / enabled state.

Instead, keep track of all ToolBarContributionRecords that require
visibleWhen updates and process them in the central RunAndTrack that is
already initialized in #init.

Also fix a context update leak: The additional context variables to
watch that were added to updateVariables, were never removed if the
toolbar contribution went away.

Implementation details:
In the central RunAndTrack, first check all visibleWhen trackings, if
they are still relevant and clear them up, if not.
Then, store the currently active context for which the RunAndTrack is
called in the HashMap, such that it can be accessed from within the
throttled runnable. Use a WeakReference to avoid memory leaks.
Inside the throttled Runnable, update the visibility of the
contributions.
