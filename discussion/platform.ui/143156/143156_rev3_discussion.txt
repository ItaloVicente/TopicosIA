Looks like both of you did not install/enable API tools.
1. Start new workspace
2. Set 4.12 RC2 as API Baseline
3. Import the org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable
==> API Tools error

I overlooked the error for the MANIFEST.MF. But which API was added with this commit? Look at the code change and let me know, nothing looks like an API change to me.

Mickael, can we activate the API baseline check already for platform UI?

Sorry, I only saw the error. If you are sure that there is no API change as per the JLS, then please open a bug report against PDE API Tools. Otherwise fix the version.

Vikas, can you tell us why the error is reported. I will not surpress the error via a filter, you will check to revert the filter to see the API baseline error.

So, are you sure the error is not correct? Please clarify that.

No API error in code and I do not see anything relevant in the code

There won't be an error on the new/changed/deleted member.

This is like you get a compile error: you can't ask JDT Core or OpenJDK or Oracle to investigate this for you. You have to look into it and if you think the error is not OK (which certainly can be the case), you have to file a bug report and explain what you think is not OK. The same applies here.

We are one team Dani, so maybe next time you do not review the "tool bar" typo Gerrit which I already reviewed and spend this saved time on looking on the code.

Hm. That's a personal preference, that really small if-s are one liners. But thinking about this afterwards I think it would have been better to use accepted convention and put brackets everywhere.

+1, I think consistency and automation is important for an OS project
