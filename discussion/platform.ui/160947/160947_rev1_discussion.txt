Line:7, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> version was already incremented for 4.16
please revert

Line:119, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/impl/dom/ViewCSSImpl.java -> creating arrays with a null inside looks fishy

Line:124, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/impl/dom/ViewCSSImpl.java -> this will always add 'null' at the end of the list

Line:129, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/impl/dom/ViewCSSImpl.java -> How about building a Stream of the hierarchy. This would look as follows:

	private Stream<Node> getHierarchy(Node node) {
		return node != null ? Stream.concat(Stream.of(node), hierarchy(node.getParentNode())) : Stream.empty();
	}


       Node[] hierarchy = getHierarchy(elt.getParentNode()).toArray(Node[]::new);


However, this would scrumble a bit the match() logic in the selectors. The given hierarchy array can't be null then.

I have to admit I did not completely get the logic in there (CSSDescendantSelectorImpl, CSSDirectAdjacentSelectorImpl).

Could you try to make them work with the logic above using the stream?

Line:56, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/impl/sac/CSSChildSelectorImpl.java -> This only worked because you passed in the artificial null element. Without the array could also be empty.

The logic would have to change to something like follows:

	public boolean match(Element e, Node[] hierarchy, int index, String pseudoE) {
		if (index >= hierarchy.length) {
			return false;
		}

		Node n = hierarchy[index];
		if (n.getNodeType() == Node.ELEMENT_NODE && hierarchy.length > index) {
			return ((ExtendedSelector) getAncestorSelector()).match((Element) n, hierarchy, index + 1, null)
					&& ((ExtendedSelector) getSimpleSelector()).match(e, hierarchy, index + 1, pseudoE);
		}
		return false;
	}

Line:55, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/impl/sac/CSSDirectAdjacentSelectorImpl.java -> typo hiearchy => hierarchy

I will revert the manifest change no problem, thanks for the advice.

The logic does depend on a null in the array, that was intentional.  I can try to make it work with the stream, and protecting against dereferencing the array at an invalid index in the selector code.  Is there a particular reason that a stream is preferable over the way that I had it implemented with a list-to-array?

Really, admittedly I don't have a strong grasp on the logic inside CSSDecendantSelectorImpl and CSSChildSelectorImpl either.

Line:7, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> I was not sure if this was the appropriate change to the version number.  The interface that changed, was changed in a backwards compatible fashion.

Then we should not touch that too much. The reason why I proposed this was that it looks nicer and that I thought that the null element looks fishy.

Then please define a constant NO_NODE for that array to avoid its permanent creation.
Line:7, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> Versions have to be incremented when a bundle has changed the first time after a release. But only once. Since this already happened this must not happen here.
