DESCRIPTION:

Remove unnecessary layout call on shell in
Snippet019TreeViewerWithListFactory

I think the layout call on the shell after opening it is unnecessary.
The open() calls calls already updateLayout via the following call
chain:

GridLayout.layout(Composite, boolean) line: 200
Shell(Composite).updateLayout(boolean) line: 1812
Shell.setVisible(boolean) line: 2813
Shell.open() line: 1923

Where are more such examples, I post changes for them after Jens had the
chance to look at this one.

Jens, I see you as owner of databinding, hence I added you to this trivial change. If I do not hear from you I plan to merge today, AFAIK tests and example do not require extra approval.

I haven't had time to look at this but I have no objection.

I am flattered. :) I like Eclipse and the databinding framework and I want to continue to do work on it.

But generally it varies greatly how much time and energy I have to spend on databinding and Eclipse. So often I will not be able to be very responsive.

No worries, this is a common situation in any OS framework which is partially developed by volunteers. I also frequently disappear and reappear. :-)

Example code, AFAIK this does not require extra committer to validate.
