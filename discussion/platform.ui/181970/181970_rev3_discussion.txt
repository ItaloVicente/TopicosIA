DESCRIPTION:

Bug 574200 - Bump Jface to Java 11

As we have incoming changes in Gerrit which wants to use Java 11
featureas and most of the platform plug-ins have moved to Java 11, I
think we should also update JFace.

Includes a fix in SubContrributionManager which became visible after the
Java version change.
