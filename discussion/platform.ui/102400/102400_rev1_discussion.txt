DESCRIPTION:

Bug 508508 - Browser editor to allow auto-refresh on resource change

Added a button/feature to BrowserViewer that can toggle auto-refresh.
Auto-refresh is implemented through a WatchService, which will monitor
the html file that is currently being displayed. Any changes to the code
will trigger a browser refresh, showing the newest changes. The toggle
right now is currently next to the refresh button, but can be moved.

Looks good to me at first sight! I'll try to spend more time on it and I would like any other contributor to have a look to.

One question (that's not a blocker for this review) is about the default enablement of this feature. Am I right to believe that the feature would be turned off by default and be opt-in? And that it would be true for any editor instance?

Hi Mickael, yes, you are right to believe so. It should be currently defaulted to be set off, and would only be turned on should the user click the toggle.
