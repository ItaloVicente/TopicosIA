DESCRIPTION:

Bug 552652 - [Progress] Progress bars flicker on Windows

Progress view will often dispose and recreate progress items. E.g. on
some refreshes or any time an element is added. The new progress bar is
initialized with zero progress and then set to the current job progress.
On Windows if a progress bar is set to a higher value an animation is
enforced. Therefore every time a new item is added any existing progress
bar jumps to empty and animates back to its previous value resulting in
flickering.
This is usually no problem on Linux because the jumps from current
progress to zero progress back to current progress are not animated and
therefore not visible.

Patch Set 2:

Thank you for the feedback Karsten. I found something which might result in a slightly wrong item order in some conditions. Will test this and might add a unit test.

It's better anyway to merge this in a separate I-build as the KeepOne fix so I merge it tomorrow.
