DESCRIPTION:

Bug 558470 - Improve readability of revision information in dark mode

Use a slightly brighter color for the line numbers in dark mode. The
new color has the same hue but a brightness of 60% as opposed to 51%
before. This suffices to make author information and line numbers far
better readable when "Color by Author" is used.
