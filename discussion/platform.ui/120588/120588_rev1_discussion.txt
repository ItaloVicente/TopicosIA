DESCRIPTION:

Bug 531588 - Actions of all pages shown at once after perspective reset

After a perspective reset, switching to the console view results in a
toolbar which contains all actions of all open pages.

Pages in PageBookView hide and show their contributions when a page is
displayed. After a perspective reset however, the contributions of the
already open pages are added to the view toolbar from the e4 model
itself. Since no one manages visible/hidden contributions, all
contributions of the open pages are visible a the same time.

Another problem is that after a perspective reset, the toolbar
referenced by the open console pages is disposed, and a new toolbar is
created. The console pages will not mark the new toolbar as dirty,
whenever they update the visibility of their contributions.

This change ensures that whenever the Console View is deactivated, all
toolbar actions are hidden. It also ensures that, on Console View
activation, the toolbar actions of the active page are shown.

This is only half of the necessary changes; the patch does not solve the
problem of not updating the new toolbar, which is created with the
perspective reset. I.e. this change is incomplete and so not to be
merged yet.
