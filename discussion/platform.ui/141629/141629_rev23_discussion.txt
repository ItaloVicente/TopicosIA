DESCRIPTION:

Use switch over strings where possible

Change cascades of ifs which can be converted to switch over Strings.
A switch statement might be faster than an if-then-else chain. And
it improves clarity.
The problem with if..else chain is that I have to look into all the if
conditions to understand what the program is doing. And the variable
might change in the chain processing.
