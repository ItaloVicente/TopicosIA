org.eclipse.ui.views.framelist.TreeViewerFrameSource don't have to be synchronized because org.eclipse.ui.views.framelist.FrameList haven't P_RESET event and #reset() method. Should I implement it?

 Done.

 > Besides that looks good.

Thanks

If it is not too much effort for you. Both classes look as if they are supposed to work similar, but in different context. I'm not sure in which context the 2nd is used, but I'd prefer to have them in sync as far as the behavior is not changed.
We have many other places where sources are obviously a copy and you don't know which changes are "better" from either side.
