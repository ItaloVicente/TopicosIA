If you load the change into a new workspace, you will see errors about the missing baseline. After adding R4.7.3 as baseline, you will get API Tools errors. You will see that adding a field is a (potential) API breakage. For details see https://wiki.eclipse.org/Evolving_Java-based_APIs_2#Evolving_API_Classes

Initial fix (Path Set 3) haven't any new methods/fields. I was asked to sync ui.views.TreeViewerFrameSource with Navigator version. If this is a problem for M7 I can split patch. Patch set 3 could be merged as is, and additional will wait for better days (even post Photon) ;)

I would be fine with a patch split. The original patch was working fine for me. I only felt that we should try to keep copies in sync if possible.
Dani, if you would be fine with that, Dawid should create a follow-up Bug with patch for post-Photon.

Karsten, that's fine with me. Before creating a follow-up bug, please investigate whether the addition is rather safe or a potential API breakage as outline in the given link.
