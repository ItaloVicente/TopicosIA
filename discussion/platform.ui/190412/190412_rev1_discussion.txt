I'd like to discuss it a bit more. It seems to me that having mechansim to keep color prefs and registry sync'd is something desired and that this patch implements that. Maybe it has a glitch in the implementation causing another bug. Was it investigated whether some other solution exist instead of reverting this whole feature?

Please see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=576331 for discussion on the problem and the solution. Also, I created a patch with your proposed solution - https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui/+/190110 which fixes the problem, but has unexpected behavior as mentioned in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=576331#c14
