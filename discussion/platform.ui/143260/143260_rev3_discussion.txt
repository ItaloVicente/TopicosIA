Thanks for that.

The opposite polarity probably won't work either.

The problem is that you have an accidental state machine.

A true state machine has a single state variable that enumerates all possible states so that state transitions can be predictable.

A pragmatic state machine maps the single logical state onto one or more variables that are necessary for other purposes. When documented and carefully considered this can be more efficient although a bit fragile.

An accidental state machine has multiple states, multiple variables and no documented relationship between them, consequently changes frequently lead to surprises.

In this case there are at least three states: LAZILY_CREATED, FULLY_INITIALIZED and DISPOSED and perhaps ten state variables. Possibly many more construction states because of the complexity of progressive state evolution through constructor/createPartControl call-backs. Possibly many more destruction states due to the complexities of Eclipse shutdown and concurrency. The problem is that you do not understand the evolution of projectWizardActions that is probably null in both LAZILY_CREATED and DISPOSED states and so your logic fails.

IMHO once an accidental state machine has been identified, it should be revised, first by enumerating the permissible states, and then possibly introducing an explicit state variable, or identifying a minimum number of primary variables from which the logical state can be deduced, and a specification of what value all other secondary variables are allowed to have in each state. You may introduce an isDisposed() helper so that you can reliably distinguish DISPOSED from LAZILY_CREATED.

I am happy to accept a patch from you.
