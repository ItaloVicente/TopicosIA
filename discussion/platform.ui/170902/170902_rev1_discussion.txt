Tobias:  The value of "os_version" can be a comma-separated string to specify multiple versions. (See org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme.exsd) It this correctly handled in your patch?
The constructor of ThemeEngine also has some "special logic" specific for the "e4 dark theme" which is also os-version dependent. How does this relate to your patch.

At least, I am thinking that this change improves the situation.
On my windows machine, following themes are registered at line 155 in ThemeEngine.java:
themeId = "org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_classic"
label = "Classic"
basestylesheeturi = "platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_classic.css"
version = ""

themeId = "org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark"
label = "Dark"
basestylesheeturi = "platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark_win.css"
version = ""

themeId = "org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_default6.0,6.1,6.2,6.3,10.0"
label = "Light"
basestylesheeturi = "platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_default_win.css"
version = "6.0,6.1,6.2,6.3,10.0"

themeId = "org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_system"
label = "System"
basestylesheeturi = "platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_system.css"
version = ""

themeId = "org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.high-contrast"
label = "High Contrast"
basestylesheeturi = "platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/high-contrast.css"
version = ""

Only the "Light" theme has a version inside the osVersion attribute and as part of the id concatenated together with the "normal" id. 
It is not clear to me why only the "Light" version gets a version.

Inside call ThemeEngine#registerStyle all stylesheets are stored in a private HashMap.
On my machine, it gets filled with following values:
id=org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_classic
stylesheet=platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_classic.css

id=org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark
stylesheet=platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4-dark_win.css

id=org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_default6.0,6.1,6.2,6.3,10.0
stylesheet=platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_default_win.css

id=org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_system
stylesheet=platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/e4_system.css

id=org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.high-contrast
stylesheet=platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/high-contrast.css

id=org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark
stylesheet=platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ant.ui/css/e4-dark_ant_prefstyle.css

id=org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark
stylesheet=platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.debug.ui/css/e4-dark_debug_prefstyle.css

id=org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_default
stylesheet=platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.debug.ui/css/e4-light_debug_prefstyle.css

id=org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark
stylesheet=platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/css/e4-dark_jdt_syntaxhighlighting.css

id=org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_default
stylesheet=platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.jdt.ui/css/e4-light_jdt_syntaxhighlighting.css

id=org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark
stylesheet=platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.pde.genericeditor.extension/css/e4-dark_pde_prefstyle.css

id=org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark
platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.pde.ui/css/e4-dark_pde_prefstyle.css

org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark
platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.genericeditor/resources/css/dark.css

org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark
platform:/plugin/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_preferencestyle.css




and now we can see the problem. 
The stylesheets contributed via plugin extension mechanism don't contain the version in the themeid for the Light theme. 

My change does the following:
when calculating the necessary stylesheets for a given themeid, all style sheets matching the themeid are taken into account ignoring the osVersion.
Reason: only the "Light" theme has a osVersion, the others not.

Would be great if someone could explain this behavior? Is this really intended?

Because only this (windows) theme has filled the os_version attribute in plugin.xml

I don't think we should ignore the os_version attribute. There may be other themes using it.
The mac dark theme also uses the os_version attribute. There is different css file for macOS versions < 10.14.
<theme
        basestylesheeturi="css/e4-dark_mac1013.css"
        id="org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark"
        label="%theme.dark"
        os="macosx"
        os_version="10.11,10.12,10.13">
</theme>

AFAIK the os_version for windows light theme was required because there were different css files for light theme for different windows versions, such as win XP, win 7, win 8 and later. Looks like the css files for the older windows versions has been removed now. So, may be the os_version attribute for the windows entry is not required anymore?

Thanks a lot for the response and the explanation.
the extension point org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme currently allows to specify a os_version (I have just found out).
The current situation is that the extension is not taken if os_version in the extension registration is empty. Is this ok? If yes, then the current registrations for the light theme in the plugins like org.eclipse.debug.ui are not correct. Current example of org.eclipse.debug.ui registration:
<extension
            point="org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt.theme">
      <stylesheet
            uri="css/e4-dark_debug_prefstyle.css">
         <themeid
               refid="org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_dark">
         </themeid>
      </stylesheet>
      <stylesheet
            uri="css/e4-light_debug_prefstyle.css">
         <themeid
               refid="org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_default">
         </themeid>
      </stylesheet>
  </extension>

Does this now mean that a os_version needs to be specified in the extenstion registration? But, then all known os_versions windows, mac, linux needs to be specified, correct? If a new version is introduced, the extension registration gets invalid. Is this a good approach?

so you propose to remove the os_version in the "definition" of the light theme?

I think os_version is an optional attribute, extension registration should work even if it's empty. 
For example, only a couple of entires in eclipse.platform.ui/bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/plugin.xml have the attribute defined.

Yes, I think the os_version list is not required in light theme entry of windows below. But, I don't have a windows machine to verify this. So, this has to be first verified on windows.
<theme
            basestylesheeturi="css/e4_default_win.css"
            id="org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.theme.e4_default"
            label="%theme.win"
            os="win32"
            os_version="6.0,6.1,6.2,6.3,10.0">
</theme>

The os_version list was specified to support multiple Windows versions (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=443350). Since we support only Win10 now and have only 1 windows light theme, I think the os_version list for windows light theme may not be required.
