Rolf, the "only" thing which seems wrong with this change is that in the case of the empty toolbar the size is wrongly calculated. For example the Target Platform State view has an empty white space.

Maybe we could retire the visibility code and adjust the size calculation?

WDYT of this approach?

I haven't had time to look in detail. My main concern are the trimbars. Please open customize perspective and see if that creates a mess on the trimbars.

Making sure that empty toolbars are not shown, by changing the size calculation might be an option.

Otherwise, IMHO, the best solution would be to mark the toolbar as invisible non of the children are visible based on the model. I want to add a visibilityAddonProcesser to handle all visibility, but cannot find enough time to spend on that. A quick investigation showed that it is much more involved still, because the E4 model and items show on the toolbar are not in sync. E.g. E4 marks (opaque) items a visible, while they are not shown. There must be more places to sync back the legacy items to the model.

From the comments, this code is supposed to be run for trimbars only.
