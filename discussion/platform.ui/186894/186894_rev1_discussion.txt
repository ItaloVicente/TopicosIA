That's interesting: with "container" you refer to resources.IContainer?
If there is no editor for a file resource, i guess showIn would also show this file in showContainer now. That's good but unintuitive or even wrong when explicitly stating "container". Therefore i would prefer to stick with the less explicit "showInId".
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> i.e. "does move that to top"?

Line:2458, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> There is a possibility that showContainerIn was not removed (not part of the list), then it should not be added.

Yes.

I don't want to keep `Id` in the name as it's more or less a type information, that's already captured by the schema. What about `defaultShowIn` that would say that unless other criteria allow to decide of a better view, the default one would be used?
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Yes

Line:2458, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> Ack

It is more like "fallBack" then "default".
Line:109, bundles/org.eclipse.ui/schema/perspectives.exsd -> let's describe that it is a fall back AND also used to sort that entry to top

"default" is also fine to me - it's easier to read.
