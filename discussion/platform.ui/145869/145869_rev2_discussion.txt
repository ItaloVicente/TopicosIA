Thanks Tobias. Nothing against your first proposal but I think this condition is easier understandable.

We are in milestone week at the moment. I will merge your change next week.

No Problem, I see you argument at that point.

One Question regarding the process, when I pushed I`ve made a rebase. But instantly there was the Cannot Merge Label. 
Do I have anything to do there or is it normal?

This is quite normal. Platform projects never merge so every change must be on top of current master. The text would be better "I don't want to merge". And it happen often a new commit is added to master while a change is in review.

I will rebase your change next week (just a click on a gerrit button) and in the unlikely case of conflicts I will ask you to rebase manual.
