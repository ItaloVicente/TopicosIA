Regarding the message: 

I would better ask on the bug about opinions, instead of creating gerrits that spam build queue.
Line:1064, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/messages.properties -> May be:

Caution: an erroneously forced unlock may irreversibly corrupt workspace!

Line:1064, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/messages.properties -> comma?

Sorry about spamming the build queue.

Isn't the solution provided in the latest Patch Set better, than the current solution, which already led very many people to stackoverflow:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8489322/eclipse-says-workspace-in-use-or-cannot-be-created-chose-a-different-one-ho
The initial bug report is almost 15 years old. And yes there were more sophisticated solutions discussed in the bug ticket. But an enhanced error message now/soon is better than a very good solution in a few years.

I do not mean it is bad, I mean: it would be better to ask others what they think about the concrete proposed message. 

So just ask if the proposed message matches people expectations. 
If no one complains, we are done here. 

From my experience, such "small" changes trigger long discussions about "right" message, resulting in a compromise that is acceptable for most people, opposed to a change that makes only few happy and many unhappy.

Line:1064, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/messages.properties -> No. My golden rule learned at school: 'If in doubt leave it out' ;-)

Line:1064, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/messages.properties -> We never used 'Caution:' anywhere yet, but 'Warning:'. 'the workspace'.

=> Warning: an erroneously forced unlock may irreversibly corrupt the workspace!
