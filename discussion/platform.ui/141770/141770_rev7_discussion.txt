DESCRIPTION:

Bug 546542 - No busy cursor is shown when open perspective from open
perspective dialog or perspective bar after upgrade to 4.6.3

Here I have handled two cases Case 1) open dialog and select
perspective, then the openPerspective call is wrapped in
BusyIndicator.showWhile. Smiliarly Case 2) When a perspective is
selected from the perspective bar, the listened's setSelectedElement
call is wrapped in BusyIndicator.showWhile. Also removed the change in
workbench showPerspective call because if user is making this call, its
user's choice  whether to wrap the call in BusyIndicator.showWhile or
not.

I verified that. In 3.x we show the busy cursor when opening a perspective (and like we still do in 4.x when opening a view). So, restoring that behavior is the correct thing to do.

That's not good enough and does not fix the reported issue, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=546542#c0.

We need to show the busy cursor in all scenarios like we did in 3.x.

-1 for unconditional busy cursor. Eclipse 3.x is ancient and this is the first complain about it and not showing it in the fast case is a very nice feature. Please continue to discuss in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=546542#c28

Your argument is not valid. We even show the busy cursor when opening a single view! The fact we don't show it for perspectives is just an oversight when moving/implementing e4.

I disagree. See bug discussion. If you insist, please bring it to the PMC.
