DESCRIPTION:

Bug 546542 - No busy cursor is shown when open perspective from open
perspective dialog or perspective bar after upgrade to 4.6.3

Here I have handled two cases Case 1) open dialog and select
perspective, then the openPerspective call is wrapped in
BusyIndicator.showWhile. Smiliarly Case 2) When a perspective is
selected from the perspective bar, the listened's setSelectedElement
call is wrapped in BusyIndicator.showWhile. Also removed the change in
workbench showPerspective call because if user is making this call, its
user's choice  whether to wrap the call in BusyIndicator.showWhile or
not.

I have tried with org.eclipse.ui.progress.IProgressService.busyCursorWhile(IRunnableWithProgress) but this was not helping.

Also on observation : Till Eclipse 3.8 the code for perspective switch was part of WorkbenchPage which had a call to setPerspective which internally used to call the below code

// Run op in busy cursor.
BusyIndicator.showWhile(null, new Runnable() {
  public void run() {
    busySetPerspective(desc);
  }
});

As part of the move to E4 the code for setPerspective was rewritten using MPerspective and this usage of BusyIndicator was lost. So With my latest changes the busy indicator will be restricted to 2 cases 1) if a perspective is selected in "open Perspective" Dialog and 2) in the selectionHandler of PerspectiveSwitcher.
