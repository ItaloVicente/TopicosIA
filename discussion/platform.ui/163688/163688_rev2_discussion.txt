Patch Set 2:

Ups, I just noticed that RC1 is not yet out. I saw commits yesterday in SWT and incorrectly assumed that we already in RC2 phase.

AFAIK no additional builds are planned for RC1 and IMHO is it also fine to include this change in any rebuild.

If someone feels strong about it, feel free to revert and reapply after we officially open RC2.
