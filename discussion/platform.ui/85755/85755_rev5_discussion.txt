DESCRIPTION:

Bug 508183 - Disable JFace tests with Surefire

Tests have to run without workbench, and so far, all attempts
to run then without workbench on CI failed.
Skip them until a better solution is found.

The JFace tests are running currently in the workbench. Why do you want to disable them? I think it is better if they run in an Eclipse instance compare to disable them.

The issue is that these tests did currently bring false-positive (tests working with Maven, not in real tests). I won't argue whether to disable them or not, I'd rather spend some time and get some help about the core dump reported in the bug.
