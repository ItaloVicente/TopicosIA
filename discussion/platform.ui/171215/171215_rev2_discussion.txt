@Lars: As you have requested the feature, maybe you can at least make a local test in the IDE to see if it fulfills your needs?

@all anything I can do to make any progress here? The referenced bug contains an example test project for those who don't wand to fire up a full blown IDE...

Will try but I'm currently a bit low on time for non-paid work. I might be able to review next week. The usage of this in the e4 application model would make this more usable as it is I see only limited value for RCP so most of my implementation use the icon URI for their toolbars.
