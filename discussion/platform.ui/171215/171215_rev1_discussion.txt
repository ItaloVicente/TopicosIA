Line:148, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/ImageDescriptor.java -> Why SWT.IMAGE_GRAY is so special? What if this flag is combined with other flags?

Line:231, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/ImageDescriptor.java -> Should it fail early for 'null' symbol?

Line:232, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/ImageDescriptor.java -> I would avoid API that expects `null` value, for me it is better to have more methods with less parameters

Line:235, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/ImageDescriptor.java -> I would avoid API that expects `null` value, for me it is better to have more methods with less parameters

Line:47, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/SymbolImageDescriptor.java -> I would highlight this default with another constructor that has less parameters, declaring `null` as expected value should be avoided.

Line:136, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/SymbolImageDescriptor.java -> Should we use `equals` here?

Thanks for the suggestions, I'll adjust the code, also see comments below.
Line:148, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/ImageDescriptor.java -> SWT.IMAGE_GRAY is a hint to transform an image into grayscale when passed into image constructor.
According to the javadoc the following is supported:
 SWT#IMAGE_COPY
 SWT#IMAGE_DISABLE
 SWT#IMAGE_GRAY

I'm not sure if combining them is allowed, but if only SWT#IMAGE_GRAY is given we can provide a descriptor right now here.

Line:231, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/ImageDescriptor.java -> Ack

Line:232, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/ImageDescriptor.java -> The problem is there are so much possible variants that I think this will soon blow up.

Line:47, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/SymbolImageDescriptor.java -> as mentioned before this will result in many constructors and since construction is only package private the benefit is low here IMO.

Line:136, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/SymbolImageDescriptor.java -> ColorDescriptor does not declare equals but as one should not code against internal behavior I will change this.

Line:150, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/SymbolImageDescriptor.java -> Ack

Line:154, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/SymbolImageDescriptor.java -> I thought about it, but as a different font can change appearance dramatically (just think about Wingdings Font) I think it would be better to create a new descriptor with the static methods in this case.
