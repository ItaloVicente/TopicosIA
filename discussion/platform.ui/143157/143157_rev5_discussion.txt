DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 263714 - Add ListProperty#list

Add the IListProperty#list method, which returns a list that consists of
the concatenated details lists.

To do this the following changes are made:
* MultiList is updated to work with a modifiable observable
list as its top-level list.
* ListDetailValueObservableList is updates to dispose elements after they are
  removed.
* Tests have been added to MultiListTest and ListDetailValueObservableListTest.

This change is basically finished and is ready for review.

I have not removed the WIP flag yet, because I want to think through the solution for a while before merging.

Line:374, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/list/MultiList.java -> This code incorrectly assume oldIx < newIx. This is a bug. Will fix.

Jens, general comment to all your open Gerrits:  unfortunately we do have only you knowledgeable in the area of data binding. So I suggest you start merging your patches once you are satisfied with them and if API tools do not complain.

One thing to get more attention would be to use more data binding in the IDE related code. Maybe you could try to simplify our IDE code by the usage of data binding. For example the filter in the preference dialog could IMHO be replaced with a delayed observer.

All right. I'm happy with confidence. :)

This one change I will not merge for some time. I want to try it out in some of my projects first to verify that it works as intended.

Line:227, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/observable/masterdetail/MasterDetailObservables.java -> On a second thought, I think it is better to not expose the `disposeAfterRemove` flag as API.

I think that so few users need this so the disadvantage of the confusion that an extra method here brings is bigger than the slight increase of functionality.

I think it is better to make org.eclipse.core.databinding.properties a friend of this bundle. Then it can used ListDetailValueObservableList directly.
