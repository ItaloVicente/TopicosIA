DESCRIPTION:

Bug 325937 - Make selected part more visible

On GTK:
* Put more "light" on selected part (introduce a shade of grey for
others)
* Remove light on inactive part stack (no white, only greys)
* Remove gradients to remove the "relief" feeling that conflicts with
the light pattern.
On Windows:
* reduce contrast on inactive tab gradient
* reduce contrast between inactive tab and unselected inactive tabs by the use of a light blue background color

It is a small improvement, but it is definitely an improvement, and it does not looks completely different as before.

This patch is also good on GTK.
@Andrey: who should we ask to get it merged?

Someone with the Mac, just to confirm that the small change in the basestyle doesn't break something there.

Brian, you're a mac user, right?
If so, can you please check that change and merge it if it's still OK on Mac?

It looks ok to me: the net effect is that the active tab text when the window loses focus becomes a very very dark grey: it still looks black to my tired old eyes.
