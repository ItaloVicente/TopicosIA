Do we want to allow the user to set/reset this in the preference setting?

I don't think it's worth to expose the settings as single preferences.  Most users will either see the dialogs once a year or so and will just hit Ok, and some few people will say "Do not show again" since they are too often confronted with this situation.  Those people will probably not want to enable them again.  In this respect the settings are different from the "Use as default workspace" checkbox, for which there is a preference.

Is there a "catch all" setting for Platform UI like "Reset all warnings"?  If yes, we should integrate the switches there.

Christian, I agree, I also don't think it is worth a setting. I'm just not sure about the platform.ui policy here, I add Dani to comment.

Dani, this change allow to switch of the warning to warn for newer workspace versions. Christian and I think we don't need an option in the preference to revert that. Let us know if that is OK
