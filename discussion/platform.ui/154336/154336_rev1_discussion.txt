DESCRIPTION:

Bug 558227 - AbstractCSSEngine is really inefficent (could be only
windows)

Introduce a IStreamdingNodeList interface that NodeList implementors can
implement for more optimal streaming of there children
CompositeElement is an implementor of that interface so it doesn't have
to call composite.getChildren() for every call to getLength() or
item(index)

Line:2, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/dom/IStreamingNodeList.java -> Please use 2019 and your affiliated company here, or your name when you are committing independent

Line:23, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/dom/IStreamingNodeList.java -> their ?

Line:23, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/dom/IStreamingNodeList.java -> typo

Line:25, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/dom/IStreamingNodeList.java -> add email address

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/dom/IStreamingNodeList.java -> missing @since

I'm unsure if you'd have to increment the bundle's minor version. The package is not public API, so a micro version increment should be enough.

Line:75, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/dom/CompositeElement.java -> use method reference here?

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/dom/IStreamingNodeList.java -> should i updated on both plugins that i change?
like: 
org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core = 0.12.1000.qualifier -> 0.12.1100.qualifier
and 
org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt = 0.13.800.qualifier -> 0.13.900.qualifier

who normally does that? because is it not updated before by anyone and there is no release? I don't know how that is handled in eclipse (we have a version bumb tool that we run when we make a release)

Line:25, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/dom/IStreamingNodeList.java -> But if you add it please not with <>. Use &lt; &gt; or {@literal <mail>} or whatever alternative you prefer.

In this Javadoc it count as unknown tag and would also be invisible in the Javadoc tooltip. In is ok in copyright header.

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/core/dom/IStreamingNodeList.java -> As Karsten correctly said all bundles here are internal. So neither @since nor minor version bump should be required.

The @since version is the bundle major.minor version after required version changes. Not the next simrel version 4.15.

Most rules for version change can be found at https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering.
For internal stuff as here it is enough to increment the service segment by 100 once for the first change in a development cycle. It can be done by the contributor and is often done by the committer (since most contributors do not know the eclipse version rules yet).
Change is best done as a separate commit. See for example https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/154275/ which did the required version change for org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.core (so no additional change there). org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt is also already done.

PS: I tried to rebase your change to trigger a new build but it has conflicts so you need to manually rebase.
