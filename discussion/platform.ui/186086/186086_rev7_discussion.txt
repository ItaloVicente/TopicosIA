DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576740 - Add a LRU resource cache

It is disabled by default.

Can be enabled with system property
"org.eclipse.jface.resource.cacheSize=300"
Can be disable with system property
"org.eclipse.jface.resource.cacheSize=0"

Removes all hotspots from org.eclipse.jface.resource.ResourceManager

Does not only affect ResourceManager but allows also repeated calls of
setImage() to check for same Image instance and avoid that NO-OP.

Especially from loading images for toolbar:
The problem was that the former reference counting did destroy the
images just before reloading them again.

I would also like to see it enabled by default
In the test setup you could set the preference. IIRC Eclipse debug test or JDT debug do this a lot, if you want I can search for it.  Alternatively LocalResourceManager could also allow to dispose its cache for the tests. How many test are failing with the change?
