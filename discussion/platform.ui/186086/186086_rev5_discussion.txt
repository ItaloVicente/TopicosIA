DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576740 - Add a LRU resource cache

It is disabled by default.

Can be enabled with system property
"org.eclipse.jface.resource.cacheSize=300"
Can be disable with system property
"org.eclipse.jface.resource.cacheSize=0"

Removes all hotspots from org.eclipse.jface.resource.ResourceManager

Does not only affect ResourceManager but allows also repeated calls of
setImage() to check for same Image instance and avoid that NO-OP.

Especially from loading images for toolbar:
The problem was that the former reference counting did destroy the
images just before reloading them again.

1.) Turns out adding a SoftReference feature is not possible with a wrapper around DeviceResourceManager. It would require to hold a softreference to the resource itself. Thats only possible by copy&paste or modify both DeviceResourceManager and AbstractResourceManager (they and their methods are marked final). This is something i would like to avoid. I see little use of the SoftReference feature, as the cache is tiny anyway and would prefer this wrapper implementation for beeing least intrusive. What do you think about it?

2.) I would like to keep LazyResourceManager non-api. but want a test for it. But i can not move it to "internal" because getDefaultImage() is not public. Nor can i simply move the test to the "org.eclipse.jface.resource" package, because osgi does not find the real package classes then. I dont know why. Any idea?

You could change the JFace test bundle to a fragment. This way the tests could access also internal classes.

You could also move the class to an internal package export the package with x-internal so that it is not API but can be accessed via tests.

I can not move the class because getDefaultImage() is not public :-(

Third alternative :-0 would be to use the fitting set of @Noreference @Noextends @Noimplements annotations on a class / interface to avoid something to become API
