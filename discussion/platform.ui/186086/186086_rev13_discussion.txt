DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576740 - Add a LRU resource cache for images

Can be disable with system property:
 "org.eclipse.jface.resource.cacheSize=0"
Default cacheSize=300.

Removes all hotspots from org.eclipse.jface.resource.ResourceManager

Does not only affect ResourceManager but allows also repeated calls of
setImage() to check for same Image instance and avoid that NO-OP.

Especially from loading images for toolbar:
The problem was that the former reference counting did destroy the
images just before reloading them again.

Caches all Images loaded from filesystem/url during startup of
org.eclipse.sdk.ide. Only the light weight RGBColorDescriptor is
destroyed during startup of org.eclipse.sdk.ide.

I am not sure what you suggest. The LRU cache itself (LinkedHashMap) is pretty tiny part of the code. The majority of this contribution is to *use* a cache at the right spot and to avoid it on at other places.

I changed shouldBeCached to a final member to avoid clients to return a value that may change over time.

Yes, I know - and I appreciate that contribution! I just wonder if it wasn't time to go one step further and instead of adding adhoc implementations every time you need it finally switch to jsr107 and jcache as common caching infrastructure so that you can see what is going on at runtime without a debugger and profiler.
So that you can make use of builtin functionality of 
javax.cache.management.CacheMXBean
javax.cache.management.CacheStatisticsMXBean
and you can see something like
https://abhirockzz.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/jcache-runtime-stats.jpg
for each and every caching facility within eclipse.
Making use of jcache adds of course another dependency but in the end I would be able to really prove it makes sense to add caching at any time.
And it doesn't seem to be complex implementation wise - not sure about legal issues.

But maybe this gerrit is not the right one to discuss it..

I totally agree that it is not good to have so many different cache implementations throughout the whole eclipse source code. I would like if you could change that. However i also know that we (especially at JDT) take much more care for litte performance differences and there is probably no library specialized for caching char[] because char[] is mutable.

Sravan any idea why platform.ui builds timeout after ~40 min? How to increase timeout?

There is a 40 min time out for platform.ui gerrit jobs. See:https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/tree/Jenkinsfile#n3

If you need to increase the timeout please update the above mentioned line and add it to your gerrit patch. The validation job will pickup new configuration from your patch.
