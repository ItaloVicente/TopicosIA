DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576740 - Add a LRU resource cache for images

Can be disable with system property:
 "org.eclipse.jface.resource.cacheSize=0"
Default cacheSize=300.

Removes all hotspots from org.eclipse.jface.resource.ResourceManager

Does not only affect ResourceManager but allows also repeated calls of
setImage() to check for same Image instance and avoid that NO-OP.

Especially from loading images for toolbar:
The problem was that the former reference counting did destroy the
images just before reloading them again.

Caches all Images loaded from filesystem/url during startup of
org.eclipse.sdk.ide. Only the light weight RGBColorDescriptor is
destroyed during startup of org.eclipse.sdk.ide.

No need to change test if we just not cache FormFont / FormImage but only loaded images.

Sebastian R. seems unavailable. 

Jörg, what is the benefit of this change? Will the user get better interactive performance? Can you qualify the improvement?

Example: open 100 .java files. Time for org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.javaeditor.EditorUtility.openInEditor() drops from 10.5 to 8.9 seconds. That is 0.015 sec per file open ~= 1 frame on a 70 Hz Monitor. That's just enough a user could see the a difference. 
Most of the time saved is by reducing org.eclipse.jface.action.ActionContributionItem.updateImages ().
I hope somewhen the remaining time will also be optimized away. On Version 2021-03 the same took  13.7 sec.

No user will probably recognize such small performance improvements on a new version but when they turn back to an old version they feel that the old version was slower. At least that is the feedback i get from colleges.

Thanks for the info. How large is the LRU cache in your example approximately?

With a Heap Dump i can see LazyResourceManager$LruMap.size=86 (start eclipse in jdt perspective + open .java files).

please wait with merge, i just saw a flaw with referencecounting during debugging that may need a fix.
