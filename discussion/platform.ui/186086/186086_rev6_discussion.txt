DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576740 - Add a LRU resource cache

It is disabled by default.

Can be enabled with system property
"org.eclipse.jface.resource.cacheSize=300"
Can be disable with system property
"org.eclipse.jface.resource.cacheSize=0"

Removes all hotspots from org.eclipse.jface.resource.ResourceManager

Does not only affect ResourceManager but allows also repeated calls of
setImage() to check for same Image instance and avoid that NO-OP.

Especially from loading images for toolbar:
The problem was that the former reference counting did destroy the
images just before reloading them again.

Seems to work. Hidden gems.
That "additional.bundles = org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.annotations" in "build.properties" was auto added. I never used it before. is it meant to be like that?

I'm not terribly sure yet why it's not enabled by default but the change looks reasonable to me.
Line:14, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/LazyResourceManager.java -> Should this class override #dispose and also dispose it's parent?

Line:60, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/LazyResourceManager.java -> Why would the map ever be null?

Line:237, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/images/LazyResourceManagerTest.java -> Maybe remove the commented code or uncomment but rename the testmethod such that it is skipped by default?

Yes, i think otherwise the build will fail but we don't want to have a Manifest.MF dependency on the development-time only lib.

I did not enabled LazyResourceManager by default because that breaks a lot of junit tests which check that the destroyed resource is disposed.
I would like to enable it for the eclipse IDE though. If you have a idea how it could be enabled by default i would like to know (just disable during the failing junit tests?).
Line:14, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/LazyResourceManager.java -> That's a brilliant question, because i did not even know of it's existence.
however it looks like that is only used for disposeExec/cancelDisposeExec. Either all of those 3 should forward to parent, or none of them.
Feels like it does not matter which Manager instance does it. LocalResourceManager does not forward either, so i prefer to not do it as well.

Line:60, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/LazyResourceManager.java -> ack. left over from previous patches

Line:237, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/images/LazyResourceManagerTest.java -> Done

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:14, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/LazyResourceManager.java -> the dispose() does not dispose the manager but only "any remaining resources allocated by this manager". i.e. only calls the disposeExecs. Like LocalResourceManager the lazyresourceManager is a wrapper around DeviceResourceManager, A wrapped DeviceResourceManager will never receive a "disposeExec" and never is disposed().

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:14, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/LazyResourceManager.java -> All usages of the LocalResourceManager are instantiated with the JFaceResource.getResources as a parent. That one is most likely correctly disposed from somewhere else.

The LazyResourceManager has an "unmanaged" parent though I think disposing that one on dispose the right choice. I'm not convinced that LocalResourceManager is a valid blue-print here.
