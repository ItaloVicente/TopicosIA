DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576740 - Add a LRU resource cache for images

Can be disable with system property:
 "org.eclipse.jface.resource.cacheSize=0"
Default cacheSize=300.

Removes all hotspots from org.eclipse.jface.resource.ResourceManager

Does not only affect ResourceManager but allows also repeated calls of
setImage() to check for same Image instance and avoid that NO-OP.

Especially from loading images for toolbar:
The problem was that the former reference counting did destroy the
images just before reloading them again.

Caches all Images loaded from filesystem/url during startup of
org.eclipse.sdk.ide. Only the light weight RGBColorDescriptor is
destroyed during startup of org.eclipse.sdk.ide.
