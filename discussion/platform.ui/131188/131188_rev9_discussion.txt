DESCRIPTION:

Bug 540297 - IWorkbenchPage.findView finds view from another perspective

Whenever a view is open in an inactive perspective, if that view is
opened and then closed in the active perspective,
IWorkbenchPage.findView(String) is able to find the view. This should
not be the case.

The undesired behavior is due to IWorkbenchPage.hideView() setting the
"to be rendered flag" on a placeholder which is not asked for the flag
during IWorkbenchPage.findView().

This change builds on the fix for bug 466230 by also asking the
placeholder reported by EModelService.findPlaceholderFor(). Only if both
the current shared reference (asked with fix for bug 466230) and that
placeholder are to be rendered, will the view be used as a result of
IWorkbenchPage.findView().

This change also adds a test which shows bad behavior when a view is
open in another perspective of a workbench window. The test will open a
test view in one of two test perspectives in resp. one of two test
windows. The test then validates the output of IWorkbenchPage.findView()
to ensure it returns non-null only if the view is actually open in that
page.

I've fixed the logic in case we don't get any part we should not say it is to be rendered :-)

Nice test BTW.

Are you sure about this? If there is no place holder, we should not report "false", otherwise a view that is open in the current perspective only (and is e.g. active) will not be found at all?

I'll run the test with this change to check (since its not ran automatically... the internal test suite is not part of any suite).

A method called isPartPlaceholderInPerspectiveToBeRendered can't return true if there is neither part nor placeholder found.

OK, I ran the test and behaviour is fine. When debugging, nearly always there seems to be a shared reference and a place holder.

Still, I would prefer to just rename the method. If there is no place holder / shared reference, then we don't care about their "to be rendered" state?

Not sure what do you mean by that renaming. The method does now what it says. For sure, if nothing is there, this "nothing" can't be rendered too, so why is the name not OK?

The previous logic was "if no shared reference OR shared reference to be rendered", and then the view was added to the results.

The current logic is "if shared reference AND shared reference to be rendered" then the view is added to the result.

Likewise with the place holder.

In my patch set, the logic is the same, only the place holder check is added on top of it in the same manner as before. In the newer patch set, the logic is changed to accommodate the method name.

I think its better to change the method name and keep the older logic, as nobody has complained about the older logic so far.
