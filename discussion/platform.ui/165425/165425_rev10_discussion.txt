Build and test are OK, but Eclipse project is currently in a code freeze period.
Please wait for end of code freeze period before merging.

This looks awesome. 

In the SWT factories we have to option to configure the factories and re-use them. Would this also be possible? For example, configure Bind to use the same bindingContext, something like

Bind configuredBind = Bind.for(bindingContext);
Or if more is the same:

Bind configuredBind = Bind.for(bindingContext).convertTo(..).convertFrom();

// Reuse the above configuration...

configuredBind.from(..).to().bind();
configuredBind.from(..).to().bind();

At lease the bindingContext configuration could be catched in the / most cases I can image.

Thanks, Lars. :)

Hm. I'm not sure how easy this would be. It would at least take some rewriting. I'll think about it.

Right now the binding is based on that the steps happens in a certain order: First setting the from-end observable, then setting converters, then setting to-end observable.

I think, to be able to support the ordering of steps that you propose alongside current step order, that would complicate things pretty much.

And I don't think I want to replace the current step ordering, so that settings of observables always comes last...


But I agree that it might be useful! I will think about it!

Agree! Really Awesome.
Lars, is the re-use option really needed? I used (EMF)databinding a lot and I remember only a  very, very few occasions where I could have re-used (half of) a binding. E.g. a checkbox <-> boolean binding and secondly the boolean is used to trigger the enabled state of a text field. So it is not even the whole binding logic which is re-used here but only half of it (namely the boolean model binding).

Do you see a use case for re-using it?

Not a huge one. This is already awesome, so +1 for a merge.

Jens, can you drop the WIP prefix?

I'm glad you think so! :)

I though about this a bit and I also don't think it is a good idea. It complicates the implementation (much more that for LayoutFactories, for example). And it's easy to achieve the same thing with a simple method that performs the binding. 

> Jens, can you drop the WIP prefix?

No! The following work remains:

* Tests
* Try out the API in real code, for example in e4tools.
* Snippets for this specifically?
