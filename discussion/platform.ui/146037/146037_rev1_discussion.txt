Your commit message is not very descriptive, and you are not referencing a bug you are trying to solve. It is unclear what you are trying to accomplish here.

Note that WorkbenchLogger is internal, so it is not intended to be used by a user. Futhermore, the bundelName is supposed to be injected from the context. Couldn't you set 'logger.bundlename' in the context?
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Please reference the bug you are trying to solve. See https://wiki.eclipse.org/Platform/How_to_Contribute#Commit_Message_Conventions

Ah sorry for the trouble. patch created to solve https://github.com/eclipse/dartboard/issues/96

We are trying to log without adding the Activator class.

Nevermind, Please ignore for some time Until we conclude the discussion.

We need a use-case for this inside the Eclipse SDK to accept additional internal methods.

Abandoned

I'm abandoning this one as it seems to me that there is no supporting use-case, and IIRC Lakshminarayana isn't doing Eclipse plugin development anymore.
@Lakshminarayana: please ping me if I'm wrong and I'll reopen.
