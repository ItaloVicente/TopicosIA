DESCRIPTION:

Bug 577289 - preference to open large files with specific editor

Add a new preference to allow fine-grained control over which editor is
used when opening a large document. If set, the already existing
preference 'LARGE_DOC_SIZE_FOR_EDITORS' overrides the new preference.

A preference is stored per file type, the value of the preference lists
pairs of file size limit and associated editor ID. The value
'largeFileLimits_prompt' can be used to indicate the user should be
prompted with a dialog to select an editor.

In addition, the preference 'largeFileLimits_DEFAULT' can be set to
specify default behavior for all document types, which don't have a
specific preference set.

The new preference can be set per plug-in customization e.g. as follows:

# all types with a preference, needed by the preference page UI
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/largeFileLimits_types=java,xml,txt
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/largeFileLimits_disabled=cpp

# default, show prompt for all types that don't have a preference
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/largeFileLimits_DEFAULT=100000

org.eclipse.ui.workbench/largeFileLimits.java=4096,org.eclipse.ui.DefaultTextEditor,8192,largeFileLimits_prompt
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/largeFileLimits.xml=1048576,org.eclipse.ui.DefaultTextEditor,77777,Emacs
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/largeFileLimits.txt=2048,largeFileLimits_prompt

Some non-code comments from user point of view.

1) File types don't have icons on them in the upper table, looks inconsistent compared to the lower table / existing preferences. org.eclipse.ui.IEditorRegistry.getImageDescriptor(String) is our friend.

2) Lower table should sort the entries by limit size, higher limits should be sorted after smaller.

3) "Choose editor now" is a bit misleading, because it doesn't do anything *now*, but on the "OK" for the entire dialog. Also it doesn't show *current* editor, if one is already selected.

I think here we can change it to be a "Choose editor" as Link (and the dialog will be opened on clicking this link and not on "OK"). If editor was already selected, we could show "<XYZ editor>" as a link.

4) In the "Add associated editor" dialog I would layout the not in a single row with two columnt, but in one column with two rows. First row the "Document size" part, second the "Editor to use" part.

5) "Add associated editor" -> "Add Associated Editor" for the title.

6) "Add associated editor" *inside* wizard should be "Add editor association for large '*.java' files".

7) "Choose editor and specify file size" -> "Choose editor and specify file size limit. '*.java' files above this limit will be opened with the selected editor."

8) "Document size" -> "File size". We should be consistent in wording.

I personally miss <Restore Defaults> and <Apply> buttons. They are no on the original "File Associations" page too, so I wonder why? But we can postpone this.

One UI issue more: the text editor for the "default" limit at the top of the preference page is too narrow. If I change "8" to "10" MB, I only see "1" in the text field. That field should allow to see at least 3 characters.

Are you sure you want to invest code and effort into this? Its hard for me to imagine an actual use case where the table has more than 3 rows. We are sorting the table for this small amount of rows?

I.e. you want the radio buttons to remain, but the bottom radio button must also be a link, which upon click opens a dialog?

How does the dialog behave when the 2nd radio button is checked, but no editor is chosen yet? Disable the "OK" button?

Or you don't want radio buttons, but you want only a single link the user can click on? If so, how do we differentiate between a specific editor and asking the user at file open?

Yes. Rows 1 MB | 10 MB | 100 MB look consistent, and are easier to understand as 100 MB | 1 MB | 10 MB.

Yep.

Sure, plus "Please select editor to use" error message in wizard.

Which editor do you want to use for the displayed icon? In the other preference page, the "default editor" is used. We don't have a "default". Do we use the editor specified for the largest file size? And do we list an icon if that editor is actually "prompt for an editor" (if so, which icon do you want)?

The default editor used for "regular" files, I guess this is what is given by org.eclipse.ui.IEditorRegistry.getImageDescriptor(String)
