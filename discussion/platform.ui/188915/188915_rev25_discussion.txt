DESCRIPTION:

Bug 577289 - preference to open large files with specific editor

Add a new preference to allow fine-grained control over which editor is
used when opening a large document. If set, the already existing
preference 'LARGE_DOC_SIZE_FOR_EDITORS' overrides the new preference.

A preference is stored per file type, the value of the preference lists
pairs of file size limit and associated editor ID. The value
'largeFileLimits_prompt' can be used to indicate the user should be
prompted with a dialog to select an editor.

In addition, the preference 'largeFileLimits_DEFAULT' can be set to
specify default behavior for all document types, which don't have a
specific preference set.

The new preference can be set per plug-in customization e.g. as follows:

# all types with a preference, needed by the preference page UI
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/largeFileLimits_types=java,xml,txt
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/largeFileLimits_disabled=cpp

# default, show prompt for all types that don't have a preference
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/largeFileLimits_DEFAULT=100000

org.eclipse.ui.workbench/largeFileLimits.java=4096,org.eclipse.ui.DefaultTextEditor,8192,largeFileLimits_prompt
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/largeFileLimits.xml=1048576,org.eclipse.ui.DefaultTextEditor,77777,Emacs
org.eclipse.ui.workbench/largeFileLimits.txt=2048,largeFileLimits_prompt

The new checkbox "use this editor with all XYZ files over X by" doesn't *properly* work.
I see that there will be no second time question (good), but I don't see any preference added, so I can't change that anymore (bad).

The preference replaces the prompt for editor for the current matching size. You wanted something different?

Or you don't see the replaced preference?

As said: I don't see any preference added, so I can't change that anymore (bad).
NO. Nada. No preference in UI visible, but I assume it is somewhere set, because editor opens without asking and I can't change that anymore.

Expectation: selecting the checkbox would add a new preference and user *can see & change* that preference  later in the preferences UI.

Please list the steps you are doing. What I'm trying works fine.
