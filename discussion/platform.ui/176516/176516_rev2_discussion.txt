I was just reading through the code and to me it's mostly looking different from what we had before, but not necessarily more failsafe or certainly not easier to use.
Future based APIs come with some expectations, e.g. a clear contract what happens on cancellation and exceptions (Exception vs Throwable being propagated in the code as the future outcome or directly to the caller), or the option to provide a custom Executor. What I'm afraid of is the situation that inexperienced users will often a) try to register callbacks on the future which may well run in undefined threads or b) attempt to get the result (blocking call) with the risk of running into deadlocks again.

Sorry for the mumbling and I'm aware that this is not really an actionable feedback but this appears to be a little late in the game for the current release.
Line:95, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> JavaDoc does not match the implementation anymore.

Line:105, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> The CompletableFuture suggests somehow that the action can be cancelled, e.g. if the future is cancelled before the submitted runnable is started, the runnable should / should never be called? That should be clarified in the API docs

Line:128, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> If the future is somehow made available to the UI thread, a future.join will deadlock since the runnable will potentially never be started. We should throw an exception if a blocking operation is done on a non-completed future from the UI task.

Line:151, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Should clarify that the non-ui thread may well be the current thread.

Line:162, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> We should probably allow to pass a custom Executor that is supposed to be used instead of the ForkJoinPool.

Line:167, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Is this similar to ComputableFuture.supplyAsync?

Line:128, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Can you explain a bit more what you have in mind here? If the current thread is the UI thread then the feature is *always* completed before return. For sure one can lock-out by passing thing here and there, but that's not different from whats possible with the old API.

Line:151, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> Now with the CompletableFuture approach I think it makes sense to always execute this in the executor supplied.

Line:167, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.di/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/di/UISynchronize.java -> The problem with supplyAsync is that it does not support checked exceptions. So the code is clearly similar.
