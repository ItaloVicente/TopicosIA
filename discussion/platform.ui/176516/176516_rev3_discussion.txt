> I was just reading through the code and to me it's mostly looking different from what we had before, but not necessarily more failsafe or certainly not easier to use.

The API was newly introduced but there where concerns that a Future base approach would be more appropriate.

> Future based APIs come with some expectations, e.g. a clear contract what happens on cancellation and exceptions (Exception vs Throwable being propagated in the code as the future outcome or directly to the caller), or the option to provide a custom Executor. What I'm afraid of is the situation that inexperienced users will often a) try to register callbacks on the future which may well run in undefined threads or b) attempt to get the result (blocking call) with the risk of running into deadlocks again.

> Sorry for the mumbling and I'm aware that this is not really an actionable feedback but this appears to be a little late in the game for the current release.

No worry and thanks for the feedback. I have adjusted the code according to your recommendations especially in the area of executors and cancellation support.

This change breaks API (as highlighted by CI). Older APIs need to remain, and maybe be @Deprecated if there is general agreement that it's preferable.

@Mickael can you tell what where there is an API break? I still try to figure out why the last change has broken the build but the ones before succeed...

Mickael, this API was added in 4.19.

Any idea why the build is failing? The API error reference completely unrelated classes and even with every build the count gets higher and higher...
Anyways I think I'll follow Andreys suggestion and at least postpone the public api enhancements to the 4.20 release, I'll prepare a Gerrit for this.
