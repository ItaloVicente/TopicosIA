Yes, I also have the custom implementation of E4 About dialog in Passage Operator RCP

I have some questions regarding architecture. 
1) Currently we have org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs bundle. Can we move org.eclipse.e4.ui.about.dialog to org.eclipse.e4.ui.dialogs.about?
2) Do we really need to use org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.swt namespace for the quite common things like IProductConstants?
3) In general, can I reorder things a bit to match the current platform state?

I don't think so.

Of course

The one thing to consider is that the old dialog may have to stay if it is API, but we could deprecated it. And the IDE should of course use the new dialog.

Thanks for considering working on this.

@Lars The rebase button is not present for this change.
I fetched it to local branch and merged master to it.
After that it reports 11670 files to be commited.
Is this a right approach to continue working on it from the gerrit perspective?

I suggest to fetch the change and cherry-pick it on current master. We do not use merge commits. As your are not yet a platform committer you have to push a new change and cannot update this one.

If I cannot update this change anyway I think it is more effective to start this work from the current platform state, having this change as a reference implementation. So, I will upload a number of new changes with the reference to the Bug 457002. Are you OK with it?

You do not need my approval. He who does the work, decides. :-) That is what I love about open source and Eclipse.
