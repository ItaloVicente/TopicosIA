I vote -1 for this cosmetic change since it unnecessarily messes with the Git history and makes it harder to check changes when using the revision information in the editor.

Dani, what about the PMCs statement 
"Code clean-up should generally be accepted over maintaining Git blame usefulness."
from https://www.eclipse.org/lists/eclipse-pmc/msg03613.html ?

I didn't do this change because it's fun to do. I hosted a hackathon yesterday (in which we closed 5 bugs, btw). Files with mixed indentation is a *real* obstacle for newbies. We should make it as easy as possible for newbies to contribute to the project.

I know, but my position in the PMC was not that one ;-). So, I only gave a -1, so that someone else can +2 and submit.

As a policy we do not submit if someone puts in a minus vote.

I don't want now people submitting patches with minus votes as this would create a mistrust in the project. Dani, please change your vote to 0 if you want to express your concern.

-1 is a statement against a merge, a not a "please merge anyway".

It's just one opinion to express my concern. 0 does not do that. But as said, you can still merge. Also, we do merge changes that have a -1 vote e.g. from CI Bot.

So far we did not merge stuff if a committer said -1 on a change and I think this is a good approach.

So we had 0 to give feedback, -1 for, hey please fix this, -2 for no way

Changing this working progress and IMHO very positive progress to -1 is just an opinion would be really bad for the community. People which used to trust that others would not submit if they expressed concern would start using -2 a status which blocks parallel activity.

We can discuss in the next PMC call but that is a topic very important to me and the community and I'm would never support such a process.

Sorry Dani, please follow our processes here or ask the PMC to change it. Also I would expect that a PMC member follows PMC decision and dies not say "I was against it, so I vote -1". What kind of message is this from a PMC member? PMC decision do not matter?

I don't think we have that defined in a process (document). We only decided that -2 is a no go.

Feel free to bring this up in the next PMC call.

It is really dear to my hard, so I plan to check via the mailing list, if it is ok for a PMC member to disagree publicly with PMC decisions. I don't think that can wait a week 

Just let me know if I misunderstood you, otherwise I send the email.

The -1 documentation exactly describes my case. I think you are really nitpicking here. I remove -1 as I don't have time to argue further here.

Please answer my question, otherwise I will ask via mailing list: do you think a PMC member can publicly disagree with a PMC decision? I strongly believe not, as this would create chaos, if you feel we can, must must be clarified with the other PMC membets.

I agree with PMC decisions. In this particular case where it touches tons of files for whitespace changes I wanted to express my PERSONAL view. I did not give a -2 and it fits with the description of -1 in the link you said.

Thanks, Dani sounds good to me. I think no further clarification is need.
