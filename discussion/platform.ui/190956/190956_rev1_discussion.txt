DESCRIPTION:

Bug 578799 - Eclipse hangs when preferences dialog closed after
selecting Appearance

Theme is not changed when switching the selection in the Combo box, it's
applied only when clicking on Apply. So, we don't have to set Eclipse to
currentTheme on cancel.

Line:365, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewsPreferencePage.java -> I don't think this is correct, but the whole behavior of this preference page is inconsistent, so I can't be sure.

1. Start Eclipse in light mode.
2. Switch to dark mode.
2.1 You get a "you should restart" dialog. Don't restart.
3. Click "Cancel".

Result: Eclipse is still in dark mode. So far, the behavior is unchanged. I consider it wrong, though: since I canceled, my Eclipse should be in light mode again.

But now restart Eclipse.

1. It comes up in dark mode.
2. Go to the preference page, click "Restore Defaults". Eclipse witches to light mode.
2.1 You do _not_ get a dialog suggesting a restart. This appears to be wrong?
3. Click "Cancel".

With this change, cancelling has no effect; Eclipse is in light mode.

Previously cancelling canceled the "Restore Defaults" and would revert back to dark mode, as expected.

The restart dialog probably should be shown only if the theme change is not canceled?

Line:365, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewsPreferencePage.java -> @Thomas, Thanks for testing!
I checked the other Eclipse preference pages and see that after the change is applied by clicking on 'Apply', it doesn't get cancelled on 'Cancel'. I too thought it would cancel the change, but all other preference pages too don't Cancel the change after Apply. So, the Appearance page behavior seems inline with other pages.

But, Cancel after clicking Restore Default *does* cancel the restored state. I'll fix this and upload a new patch. 

Also, from the code, I think restart dialog is shown only when theme change is confirmed with 'Apply' or 'Apply and Close'. When theme is changed with 'Restore Defaults', it's a temporary  change that can be cancelled by pressing cancel and we don't want to restart yet. If theme change is later confirmed by pressing 'Apply', restart dialog is shown.
