DESCRIPTION:

Bug 543442 - Workbench window will not prompt to save non
CompatibilityParts if compatibility parts are also being closed.

Previously if there were CompatibilityPart elements which were dirtied,
the dirtied nonCompatibilityParts were just ignored. So now This has
been fixed so that a single dialog pops up to save the dirtied
nonCompatibility part resources and dirtied CompatilityPart resources.

Also added tests to test the new API added in SaveablesList.

I'm not sure we need all those changes. See https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=543442#c11 for very simple steps to reproduce the problem. And very important, File > Close All works, so, we already seem to have the code at hand that does the right thing. Editor Tab > Close all should just invoke the same code as File > Close All.

In the Case of File -> Close All a search is made of all IEditors present in the workbenchpage and then they are closed.
In the case of Editor view -> close all the Stack Renderer provides the list of the MParts to be closed. 
Both are two totally different mechanisms.
MPart is created when an editor view is split and a hybrid of MPart and compatibility view is not handled.
But in case of File -> close all the workbenchpage is searched for all EditorReferences and they are closed.
The whole mechanism will need to be changed if we do that for Editor view -> close all.
The same mechanism is used for close left, close right etc.
This would be a major change now.

The change that I have done fixes this issue for Editor View -> Close All

I verified that the change works for Editor > Close All. I tested with the provided editor-only (split) and sample view example.

The taken approach looks reasonable to me but I did not do a line by line review. The amount of changes is quite big.

I noticed that the parts appear in a strange order in the 'Save Resources' dialog, as opposed to being sorted alphabetically. However, AFAIK this is not a new problem, but if we change the code now, we should also address that.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Commit message should clearly mention that only Editor Tab > Close All is handled.

We should either change the message or make sure we handle all cases in this change.
