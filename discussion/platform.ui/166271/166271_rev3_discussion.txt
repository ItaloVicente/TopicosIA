now redundant.

Sorry I didn't have a chance to look at this sooner. As mentioned in https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/jdt/eclipse.jdt.ui/+/166270/4#message-0e78acb7a6cf2a9f15f2fa6e82de63de42348c78

This is a step in the right direction - but in most cases the colors can simply stop being saved as a field altogether, which further simplifies the code.
Line:55, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/fieldassist/FieldAssistColors.java -> It is probably the case that this whole caching is no longer needed now that Colors don't take resources - but I am not sure.

The fact that the whole class is deprecated means I won't spend too much time reviewing it.

Line:61, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/fieldassist/FieldAssistColors.java -> I think this field is unneeded anymore - however the nature of this class being to cache stuff, if it is removed, but requiredFieldColorMap is preserved, means that the cache has no way of emptying. That said, does anyone ever create multiple displays in one instance?

Line:52, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/preference/ColorSelector.java -> This field can be deleted - it only existed to have a handle to the color to dispose later.

(Ironically AFAICT the color was never actually disposed in all cases)

Line:112, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/ColorRegistry.java -> unrelated change - but this should say colors

Line:55, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/fieldassist/FieldAssistColors.java -> +1, as it is deprecated I also do not plan to spend too much time on it.

Line:52, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/preference/ColorSelector.java -> Alex was faster than me, I created https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui/+/166577 for the follow-up.
