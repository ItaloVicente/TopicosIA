Hi Johan, thanks for the patch.

First, comment I have is that the original filtering could be removed from NavigatorActionService as it is now no longer needed.

We will need somebody else to review as well, because I am not familiar with this part of the code base at all.

You can follow the call hierarchy on filterActionProvider, it is called in two places. Both places call findRelevantActionDescriptors which does the filtering now. findRelevantActionDescriptors not API, it is in an internal package. It is called in 3 places, the two above and in a test case.

So it might break a test-case, but looks save to just move the full functionality to the CommonActionDescriptorManager.
