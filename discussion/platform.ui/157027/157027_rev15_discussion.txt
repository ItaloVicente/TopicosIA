I like this change!
I'll let Thomas complete the review as he already did a lot.

Basically a +2 from me, except that I'm unsure about what the policies with respect to the snippets are. Is it OK if the snippets compile only with the latest and greatest JFace? (I do notice some prior commits (using WidgetFactories) that also would make snippets not compile with older JFace... but I also notice that the snippets didn't apecify any version range until now.)

Who could answer that question?

In the past, that was OK.

+2 for using latest and greatest in the Snippets. They are developer resources and developer can switch to the branch they are using.

fyi, I left out some additional cases where toList() or toArray() could be removed with IStructuredSelection now being iterable because I did not check if there are accesses within the loop iteration handling code back to the original datastructure. If we check them to not cause ConcurrentModificationExceptions we could simplify some more code (and possibly improve performance because of left out conversion step)
