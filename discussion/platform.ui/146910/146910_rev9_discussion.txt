DESCRIPTION:

Bug 549704 - Add option to rebuild projects in import wizard

This change adds an extra check-box to the Import Existing Projects
wizard. If the check-box is set, a clean-build is triggered on the
imported projects after the import is done.

Without extra preference the check-box value defaults to "false". The
default can be set to true with the preference (e.g. specified via
plugin customization):

org.eclipse.ui.ide/rebuildProjectsAfterImport=true

This change also fixes the import existing project dialog option "close
projects after import" when importing projects for an archive.

Last, the change includes test for the new option and the fix of the
close option in case of archives.

This should cover all comments so far, please continue with the review.
Line:1442, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> This one seems necessary after adding the tests to check whether cleaning an output source folder works.

I'm not sure whether the builder clean is supposed to refresh itself, but I doubt it. So I added a refresh here.

For the smart import wizard (File -> Open ...) there is this method which already does the necessary refresh:

org.eclipse.ui.internal.wizards.datatransfer.SmartImportJob.importProjectAndChildrenRecursively(IContainer, boolean, IProgressMonitor)

I've tried with a real Java project and I believe we might do something here that could be done in each the particular builder implementation.

It looks like Java builder does "clean" build for the first time even if I don't select the new checkbox. Means, Java builder can distinguish between "have no build state" and "have build state", and acts accordingly (or simply wipes out everything on full build, haven't checked that).

So probably our original problem is that "other" builders don't do that. 

The question is - do we want to have an explicit "clean" request on import or want every builder decide what to do?

I think it is OK to allow user to say explicitly "I want 'clean'  on project after import", similar to what it can say after import (Project->Clean).
Line:1438, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> Not sure why do we need two different ways to open project here? See my next comment.

If this is really needed, can we extract the common "!close" condition to have it in the "outer" if, it is common for both if/else branches?

Line:1442, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> Not sure why, but you have changed from IResource.BACKGROUND_REFRESH to IResource.NONE 

Doing so you meet bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=544975 that is internally planned for you to work on, see JEP-1423 :-)

Line:114, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/messages.properties -> I think single quotes must be written twice, otherwise they mark beginning of a "literal string" sequence.

Line:217, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/messages.properties -> Same here and closing one

Line:37, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/datatransfer/ImportTestUtils.java -> not needed, not an API

Line:141, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/datatransfer/ImportTestUtils.java -> I think we don't need to explicitly test this here.

Line:152, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/datatransfer/ImportTestUtils.java -> I believe this is what org.eclipse.ui.tests.harness.util.FileTool.getFileInPlugin(Plugin, IPath) does for you.

Line:187, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/datatransfer/ImportTestUtils.java -> bin.members() is enough here.

Line:250, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/datatransfer/ImportTestUtils.java -> Why not just folder.delete(true, null) ?

Line:299, tests/org.eclipse.ui.tests/Eclipse UI Tests/org/eclipse/ui/tests/datatransfer/SmartImportTests.java -> to be precise, we test isOpen().

Line:1442, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> Thinking again, I believe that after importing a project we don't need refresh at all, because all the data that we could refresh isn't existing at all. So I guess we can just open project without refresh in both cases. If the tests require this refresh, I would assume there must be some "not yet flushed" cache from a test before. I haven't checked it - do we use same project name on importing each time? This would explain the "cache" effect.

Line:1438, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> The background refresh is not enough when we import a project from a location without copying it. In that case, we will tell project builders to clean the project while the resources are not yet refreshed.

In the case of my test builder, this results in not being able to clear the contents of the bin/ folder (since the bin folder is not accessible without the refresh).

Line:1442, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> See my comment above. Without the explicit refresh, when resources are not copied, they are not refreshed. I think this is due to telling IProject that its files are at location X with the project description.

When the files are copied into the workspace, there is the import operation below this code. I am guessing its not necessary to refresh in that case, but I've not checked what the import operation does. I am guessing yes, we can remove the refresh for the copy case. But not for the non-copy case.

Though I wouldn't touch it in the context of this bug. Should we open a new one and check whether its really not necessary?

Line:1442, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/WizardProjectsImportPage.java -> I've removed BACKGROUND_REFRESH since I do an explicit refresh the line afterwards, or did I not understand your question?

I didn't find a flag "open AND refresh", only "open and refresh sometimes later on". This is not enough for a builder clean method that expects project files to be in sync (which I assume any builder method expects).

Line:114, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/messages.properties -> Writing them twice results in the label text: ''clean''

Writing them once results in: 'clean'

I am guessing you want the latter, so leaving as is?

JDT builder could just wipe output dir on a "usual" full build, haven't checked this in the code.

 > How did you check the above?

Good old manual tests :-) Just imported some PDE project I had in the zip that contained dirt in /bin and checked what happens with/without new checkbox.
