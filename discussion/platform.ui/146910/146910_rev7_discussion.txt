DESCRIPTION:

Bug 549704 - Add option to rebuild projects in import wizard

This change adds an extra check-box to the Import Existing Projects
wizard. If the check-box is set, a clean-build is triggered on the
imported projects after the import is done.

Without extra preference the check-box value defaults to "false". The
default can be set to true with the preference (e.g. specified via
plugin customization):

org.eclipse.ui.ide/rebuildProjectsAfterImport=true

This change also fixes the import existing project dialog option "close
projects after import" when importing projects for an archive.

Last, the change includes test for the new option and the fix of the
close option in case of archives.

Note: I've completely forgot that platform allows you also to use second way to import projects, via "File -> Open Projects from File System".

The same checkbox must be added there too, with same functionality (surprise :-)).

Line:114, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/messages.properties -> Not sure I like what we say here.

If auto-build is "on" (== default in most cases) the project will be *already* rebuild today.

So what we do here is to say *CLEAN* build must be triggered.

Not sure what is the best wording to say that.

"Clean build newly imported projects upon completion" ?

Sounds strange.

"Run 'clean' build on imported projects upon completion" ?

WDYT?

Line:114, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/messages.properties -> If I import a project with its bin folder, and JDT assumes there is nothing to build, auto-build does nothing? I thought this is the problem we are trying to fix with the new option?

So auto-build won't really build it in the default case, in which I exported some project (default for export includes output folders for whatever reason)?

I think the "run clean build" suggestion sounds good.

No, auto-build would not *clean* the dirt that is possible existing in the bin directory.

I think this is actually the main point of the fix, so we should change the test zip file to include some "old" bin directory structure with some "old" files and make sure after the new import option is selected, the old files disappear from the imported /bin directory.

Line:114, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/wizards/datatransfer/messages.properties -> I've tried adding a .classpath file to the archived project, with a bin folder. However no one cleans the bin folder. Do we need a Java builder for this? We don't have JDT plug-ins during those tests, so that won't do. Or is there another builder we can use?
