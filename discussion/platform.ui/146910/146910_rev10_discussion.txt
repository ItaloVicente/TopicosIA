DESCRIPTION:

Bug 549704 - Add option to rebuild projects in import wizard

This change adds an extra check-box to the Import Existing Projects
wizard. If the check-box is set, a clean-build is triggered on the
imported projects after the import is done.

Without extra preference the check-box value defaults to "false". The
default can be set to true with the preference (e.g. specified via
plugin customization):

org.eclipse.ui.ide/rebuildProjectsAfterImport=true

This change also fixes the import existing project dialog option "close
projects after import" when importing projects for an archive.

Last, the change includes test for the new option and the fix of the
close option in case of archives.

Odd, I'm fairly certain that when I (previously) exported a project with its bin/ folder and then imported it, there was no re-compile done after import (which always seemed broken to me, to the point of always excluding bin/ on export).

I don't see a breakpoint hit in org.eclipse.jdt.internal.core.builder.JavaBuilder.clean(IProgressMonitor) when I do this sequence? How did you check the above?

OK, I see this stack trace:

I.e. for JavaBuilder, FULL_BUILD means clean output folders and then build.

I see that AUTO_BUILD trigger becomes a FULL_BUILD trigger here: org.eclipse.core.internal.events.BuildManager.basicBuild(int, IncrementalProjectBuilder, Map<String, String>, MultiStatus, IProgressMonitor)

			// If no tree is available we have to do a full build
			if (!clean && currentLastBuiltTree == null) {
				// Bug 306746 - Don't promote build to FULL_BUILD if builder doesn't AUTO_BUILD
				if (trigger == IncrementalProjectBuilder.AUTO_BUILD && !isBuilding)
					return;
				// Without a build tree the build is promoted to FULL_BUILD
				trigger = IncrementalProjectBuilder.FULL_BUILD;
				isBuilding = isBuilding || builder.getCommand().isBuilding(trigger);
			}

public abstract class IncrementalProjectBuilder extends InternalBuilder implements IExecutableExtension {
	/**
	 * Build kind constant (value 6) indicating a full build request.  A full
	 * build discards all previously built state and builds all resources again.
	 * Resource deltas are not applicable for this kind of build.
	 * <p>
	 * <strong>Note:</strong> If there is no previous delta, a request for {@link #INCREMENTAL_BUILD}
	 * or {@link #AUTO_BUILD} will result in the builder being called with {@link #FULL_BUILD}
	 * build kind.
	 * </p>
	 *
	 * @see IProject#build(int, IProgressMonitor)
	 * @see IProject#build(int, String, Map, IProgressMonitor)
	 * @see IWorkspace#build(int, IProgressMonitor)
	 */
	public static final int FULL_BUILD = 6;

Christian, are the xtext builders broken here? The Java doc states, FULL_BUILD should clear output just as JavaBuilder does. Why would you need an extra CLEAN_BUILD in that case?

Thanks Simeon, I was too lazy and haven't checked what FULL_BUILD contract *really* is. It makes sense.

org.eclipse.core.internal.events.BuildManager.basicBuild() line 172 promotes AUTO_BUILD to FULL_BUILD (which follows the javadoc contract) and so every builder is supposed to "discard all previously built state" on import of a new project.

I think we are done here now, the problem is the concrete builder implementation. I'm really sorry not to checked this earlier.

Should I adjust the review to keep the close tests? Since some are missing. Also the close didn't work when importing an existing project from an archive. We can also open a ticket for this and open a new review, then merge the changes at some point in future.

I would transfer the changes you did (tests & fix for closing project) to a different ticket / review. Would be good to have them for M3 on Friday.

No, but they have their own review: https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/147698/
