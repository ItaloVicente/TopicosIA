Dani, Alex, I incorrectly increased the addons.swt  plug-in version and reverted it within a few minutes. Unfortunately this makes Gerrit verification build fails, as it now thinks addons.swt needs increase.

Let me know if this can be solved without breaking Gerrit verification. I merge the incorrect version increase again to make verification build work again.

Not sure, IMHO whenever we increase version it stays that way (unless it's major version bump but these doesn't happen by mistake :).

Actually, there is no way to fix it now that I think of it cause git will always show there are changes (only pom files are excluded) so trying to revert such change is nonsense.

As the changes happened today, I am pretty sure we can revert to 4.12 and everything should be fine again. I've done that now. Let's see whether something fails.

Tycho buildtimestap works based on git changes and as there are changes in MANIFEST.MF for the version bump and revert it will always report it as such. But please try.
