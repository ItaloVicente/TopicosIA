DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575616 - OutOfMemoryError on part create causes more exceptions/hang

This change makes CompatibilityPart.create() catch not only
RuntimeException, but also Throwable, to avoid a broken UI if e.g. an
OutOfMemoryError is thrown.

Rolf, I see 2 options:

1. Extend the handling of exceptions as in this patch, from RuntimeException to Throwable.
2. Fix bug 575641 by catching more than IOException in the respective text editor code, and close bug 575616 as "won't fix" (in case we say, we can't / won't try to recover from *every* Error the JVM throws).

WDYT? Both are fair from my POV.

There are safe runners all over the code base, to me it doesn't make sense to fix this in this particular place only. How safe is it catch Errors, and continue to use the workbench after an Error?

Also here, is it safe to catch and continue? Although I remember getting popups that suggest to close the workbench after a out of memory error occurred.

What do you suggest then? Do nothing?

I guess for platform.text we can check the file size and show an error if its above some value. That would prevent the exceptions in the first place.

Build and test are OK, but Eclipse project is currently in a code freeze period.
Please wait for end of code freeze period before merging.

I feel not to be in a position to make this decision as I am only spending some spare time on the platform, IMHO, this is an architecture decision that requires help from the appropriate people.

Who to add to the review in that case?

Since this is apparently a big change, I'll focus on fixing the text editor problem.
