Patch Set 2: Code-Review-1

This attempt is not so scary as previous one. I still dislike the static flag and the way it is used.

Also why should NestedProjectsContentProvider change the behavior of a dialog that it does not open / manage? This is not OK.

Example.

I open "Open Resource" dialog for the first time (Project Explorer not opened, I'm in Java perspective). The duplicates resources are shown, I see two files (one "duplicated").

Now I start debugging, the Debug perspective opens and Project Explorer is shown.
I open "Open Resource" dialog second time and only one file is shown.

I switch back to Java perspective and now if I open "Open Resource" dialog third time, it still shows only one file. Moreover, it will show this one file next time I start Eclipse, because the setting (which I've never touched) is now remembered.

This is un-intuitive at least, and also changes preferences without user explicit request.

In a previous patch, Dani mentioned that the value of the flag should be connected to the value in Project Explorer, so that's an attempt to achieve so.
From a end-user perspective, it's consistent.

That's actually the goal: we want that most users stop seeing duplicated resources in their IDE.
I would be fine changing the default dialogSettings for the OpenResourcesDialog so it always enable the filter by default, independently of Project Explorer, if it's OK with you.

Mickael, just push new patch set, it is easier to understand if I can see the code.
