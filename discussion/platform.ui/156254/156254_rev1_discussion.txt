This change affects not only "Open Resource" dialog, but also all clients extending it.
Line:247, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/FilteredResourcesSelectionDialog.java -> This is unexpected at least. I don't remember code that would save part of the settings conditionally, depending which UI was triggered by user before.

Line:1227, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/FilteredResourcesSelectionDialog.java -> This is unusual and setting the flag will affect all client classes who inherits this class, if they want or not.

NO GO.

Line:247, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/FilteredResourcesSelectionDialog.java -> Actually, many preference pages do work like that: they stick to the default value until they were explicitly modified.

Line:1227, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/FilteredResourcesSelectionDialog.java -> Right, I'll try to have this set in the OpenResourceDialog. That said, the OpenResourceDialog is not final neither, so it would also affect extenders. But at some point, I think it's also expected from extenders that things evolve for the best.
