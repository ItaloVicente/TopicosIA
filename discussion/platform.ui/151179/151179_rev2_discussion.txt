I think this change isn't bad, however, I'm not sure it fully fixes the initial issue. (ie what about a mapping A that set Ctrl+X B and a mapping B that sets Ctrl+X B; and user does Ctrl+X then switch from A to B and then type B?)
However, I'd be in favor of merging this patch which IMO does fix a bunch of cases without risk.
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> It's not exactly what happens with this patch, so please fix it so it says something like:
"Remove formerly active sequential key binding prefix candidate that do not match current active key bindings, typically in case the scheme changed in between keystrokes"
