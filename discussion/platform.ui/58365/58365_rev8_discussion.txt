We can't change the API page like this. We can e.g. add a new constructor where clients can tell to use the filtered tree.

@Dani: this feature IMO has a high-value for end-users. I would love to see it in 4.7. So I'll advocate for it.

I have trouble to understand what parts exactly breaks API? Is this only the JavaDoc comment replacing tree by filtered tree? As a filtered tree is a tree, we can probably adopt this change and leave the javadoc intact.

Line:16, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/contentoutline/ContentOutlinePage.java -> Why not a regular org.eclipse.ui.dialogs.FilteredTree ?

Line:16, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/contentoutline/ContentOutlinePage.java -> IIRC only the e4 tree allows dynamically enabling/disabling the filter.

AFAICS the viewer class is internal and API compliance is kept. Also API tools do not complain for me. Can you clarify what you mean?

OK, I see it might work. The confusion here is that you talk and use the wording FilteredTreeViewer, but there is no such thing. It is a FilteredTree. Please fix this in the commit message and the code and I will have another look after my vacation.

While I'm in favor of this change, I need some confirmations before I can claim it's good to merge.
1. The are big chances of this not performing very well with huge workspaces. In that case, do we have user informations (progress report, eye-candy...) and control (cancel , return to non-filtered) that allow to not be or feel stuck when filtering is happening?
Line:8, /COMMIT_MSG -> According to Dani, the commit message needs to be modified an not mention a FilterTreeViewer (only FilterTree) to not sound like an API change.

And bug number needs to be updated.
