DESCRIPTION:

Bug 407422: Mylyn context deactivation does not always close editors

CapatibilityPart was inappropriately listening for a part's widget going
null - never happens for an unrealized editor. Added a 'toBeRendered ==
false' listener in WorkbenchPage, instead. 

Also CompatibilityPart was tagging its MPart with 'removeOnHide' -
again, no good for unrealized editors. Instead, tag the MPart when added
to WorkbenchPage.

PartSeviceImpl selectedHandler was not firing partHidden on the last
hidden part.

Removed Workbench 'toBeRendered == true' listener as it never fires, and
editor/view reference creation is handled elsewhere.
