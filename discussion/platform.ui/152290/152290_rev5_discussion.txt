DESCRIPTION:

Bug 552814 - [Dark theme] Use consistent widget styling for active and
non active parts

This addresses several issues:

Not all parts are currently styled in the active state, e.g., the Target
Platform State which makes the dark theme currently feel inconsistent
It reduced the complexity of the CSS files so it them easier to
maintain.
The amount of different gray in the same UI is reduced which makes the
UI feel more consistent to me, Visual Studio code also don't use
different background colors for its widgets, so the approach seems to
work fine for them
