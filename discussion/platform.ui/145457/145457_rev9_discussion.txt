> Uploaded patch set 9.

After investigating why the test case failed I found that "sometimes" the icon URI is retrieved before it was updated and the icon indeed did not change.
With some digging into the history of the class, I found Bug 432785 to be the origin of the ICON_URI_FOR_PART work which made the icon change impossible.

I now decided to try to remove this transient data handling which results in much clearer code that works as intended. Also, I re-tested Bug 432785 (using the japanese symbols in the icon folder's name) without having any problem.

If someone could also verify that there are no other side-effects of removing the ICON_URI_FOR_PART handling, I think it should be the preferred way to get rid of it and to get this (annoying) bug here closed...

The code looks good to me.

Only wonder what the official policy w.r.t. mentioning original authors of the patch.
Line:12, /COMMIT_MSG -> Should Fabian be mentioned here as well?
