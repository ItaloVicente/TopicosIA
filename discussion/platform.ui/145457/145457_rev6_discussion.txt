The code does look fine to me, but i have some other concerns see the comment. Would it be possible to add some tests w.r.t. descriptors and parts?

@Lars do you know what the desired behavior would be?
Line:267, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/SWTPartRenderer.java -> This code raises two more (previously existing) concerns:
1. Which iconURI has higher priority the descriptor or the part?
2. What happens if the iconURI of the descriptor is changed?

I see part descriptors as blueprint for creating new parts. So after the creation of a part based on a descriptor we should be able to change the part and descriptor independently. In e4 RCP we frequently use part descriptors and the part service to create new parts, adjust the persistedState or transisient state, change the label and open the newly generated part.

Does that answer you question?

Yes, it does answer my question. And then the current patch is not correct yet, as it always gives priority to the descriptor.
