Does what it should. I have added a test case in separate change.
Just one more thought: Would the class name "LogThrottler" suite a bit better?

I saw it, thanks! I'm going to take a look at it and add a test for the setThrottle method.

That is taste, I guess. Looking at the dictionary, the Throttle is the device that does the throttling. Anyway, we can take a look at it for that other bug. It also does not necessarily need to be a log throttle. If we supply a callback to the throttle it could basically throttle anything.
