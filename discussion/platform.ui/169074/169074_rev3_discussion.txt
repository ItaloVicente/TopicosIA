Line:79, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/services/EvaluationReference.java -> move the log throttling to Activator#log?

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/services/LogThrottle.java -> This is quite limited to this bundle. I could imagine this class to be available at a more central place, so that it would be available to other bundles as well. Sure, we could start like that and later refactor this internal class to somewhere else.

Line:54, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/services/LogThrottle.java -> I think this message should not have the same log level as the message above. When an error was reported, I think warning level would be right here.
But how about other levels? Maybe "one level below" is a good choice? Assume the "once logged message" is info level, do we expect a warning? I guess not. Also info might be not necessary then.

Thanks for the review, Karsten. I have replied. Did you run the example project in this bug to see if it can be replicated?
Line:79, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/services/EvaluationReference.java -> Yes, we can work on this as part of bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=566400

At this moment I am interested to mitigate the flooding as described in this bug. I suggest to release this now and then look at 566400 for a generic solution later in 4.18

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/services/LogThrottle.java -> I agree. I have already filed https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=566400

Line:54, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/services/LogThrottle.java -> You are right, I think that should always be info. I will play with that.

Yes, I just the sample project for reproduction.

Line:54, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/services/LogThrottle.java -> Ok, I investigated. Although I agree with the fact that the message is info, it is possible that the user switches of info messages in the log filter. So the throttle warning message may be missed if the level is less severe than the original message.

WDYT? Keep the "info" message on the same level for now?

Line:54, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/services/LogThrottle.java -> I have a strong opinion for error messages. When the message is info, I'm OK with having the throttle warning on info level. I think message info and throttle on warn level won't fit, as you might only see the warning, but not the info messages that was throttled.
For error messages I think the throttle message should be on warn level.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:54, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/services/LogThrottle.java -> Ok. The throttle message is now warning. Info messages are not visible in the error log despite the value in the error log view menu.
