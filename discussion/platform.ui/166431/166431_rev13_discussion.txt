I moved everything to its place. Most noteworthy changes compared to the previous round:

new home is o.e.e4.ui.internal.workbench.swt
I had to create it here because of the JFace dependencies which were not in any of the other downstream org.eclipse.ui.workbench dependencies.

I created a new JFace IDialogSettingsProvider that takes care of loading and saving the dialog settings. Implementation is DialogSettingsProvider which takes care of the loading and saving complexity and caches the settings for each bundle. 

New instances of that class can be had by asking DialogSettingsProviderService which takes care of hooking into the workbench lifecycle for save actions.

PlatformUI is the main entrance to get the IDialogSettingsProvider instance. With the IDialogSettingsProvider instance, the user is completely free to get/save/reload at will.

I am not addressing the @Inject for e4 with this patch. It will be moved to another bug.
