DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 497444 - Progress indicator not updating in the splash screen
of Eclipse

Proof of concept

* simplifies the code
* remove unnecessary synchronize for the progress reporting of active
bundles
* Spins the event loop after
the splash creation to avoid a "ghost shell" (no content, I see the
widgets behind it).
* defines StartupProgressBundleListener as static inner class
* Trigger UI update if the startup listener is triggered for plug-in
loading
* Reset the name of task once bundle is loaded to avoid identifying
innocent plug-ins as bad guys
* Removes the last loaded bundle name from the splash screen as this is
misleading for the user, the user will think that this plug-in takes
very long to load while it is actually already finished

Line:310, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> Two problems with this:

1. If you just do a split(), the progress monitor will consume those ticks only the next time you call split() or worked() or done() on progressMonitor. So the last increment will be never shown. This should simply be worked(), not split().

2. The value of 18 is probably meant to convey something like "1 in 18 bundles starts up early". But the scale is bundleCount, not 100. So the increment should be something like Math.max(1, (int) (bundleCount / 18.0f)).

What should be done if the estimate is too optimistic and the monitor saturates too early? Since it is all an estimate anyway, we might be better off doing asymptotic progress. Don't know what might work well. 1/3 of the remaining? That'd be progressMonitor.setWorkRemaining(3).worked(1);

Line:311, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> Seems to work, though with the three early startup bundles in the Platform UI runtime workbench progress is so fast I only see it if I add breakpoints or delay this artificially by adding a Thread.sleep().
