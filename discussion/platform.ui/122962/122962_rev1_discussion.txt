DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 497444 - Progress indicator not updating in the splash screen
of Eclipse

Proof of concept, simplifies the code and now assume that 1/4 of the
bundles are early startup bundles instead of 1/10.

I like the SubMonitor very much. Is the 1/4 for testing? The real value is likely to be less than 1/10 even.

On Mac: the progress monitor doesn't show up right away because all this startup business happens in the main (UI) thread. So there's no display event processing. The progress monitor shows up only when we hit the loop in WorkbenchAdvisor.openWindows(), line 823ff. By that time early startup bundles are already loaded, and thus we don't see anything of the StartupProgressBundleListener's advancing that monitor.

Until that bit can be fixed, this whole progress monitor isn't very useful... Especially since there appears to be quite a bit happening after the early bundle loading, during which time the monitor isn't used anymore, so there's a few seconds anyway between the monitor showing up (looking blocked) until the main window comes up.
Line:309, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> Why the synchronized block? I think it could be removed, too,together with the comment. The progress monitor does everything in the UI thread anyway (via asyncExes),so there is a serialization there anyway.

Line:311, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> Why 4? I don't think we have 25% early startup bundles in any Eclipse.

How expensive would it be to obtain up front the correct number? Is that possible at all without undue effort?

Line:2463, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> I would move this down to 2508 where it's used.

Same behavior on Linux/GTK 3.

Thanks, Thomas for the feedback.

Bug fix for Bug 455162 updates the shell visibility but at least on Linux the display queue is not updated, so I get basically a ghost shell until the main event loop is hit. To make the splash screen suck less on Linux, I suggest we process the display event loop after creating the splash.

Thanks, Thomas, update to arrive soon. This is still WIP, as I still do not see get any progress reported.
Line:309, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> Done

Line:311, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> I'm not aware of an API for getting the bundles which are planned to be activated.
