DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 497444 - Progress indicator not updating in the splash screen
of Eclipse

Proof of concept

* simplifies the code
* remove unnecessary synchronize for the progress reporting of active
bundles
* Spins the event loop after
the splash creation to avoid a "ghost shell" (no content, I see the
widgets behind it).
* defines StartupProgressBundleListener as static inner class
* Trigger UI update if the startup listener is triggered for plug-in
loading
* Reset the name of task once bundle is loaded to avoid identifying
innocent plug-ins as bad guys.

Line:322, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> STARTING and STARTED don't come in pairs. The old code accounted for that. Can be nested, and if the OSGi platform can load bundles in parallel (don't know if it does or would be allowed to), could even come in any order. The only invariant is that for a particular bundle we'll get STARTING before STARTED.

You probably don't get flickering here because you spin the event loop only in one case, so I would expect the STARTED branch to not update anything in the UI.

Also, and else-if would be more appropriate here.

Line:572, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> A pity we have no better way than sprinkling partial display event loops throughout the code...

Line:628, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> progressMonitor may be null here. Also below.

Line:322, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> Thanks. I think in this case we should avoid reporting the bundle names, as I think it is misleading to list the last bundle that got loaded. It feels to the users that that this plug-in holds up the loading process.

Line:628, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/Workbench.java -> I removed this code, it did not made a visible difference for me.
