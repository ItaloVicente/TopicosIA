As you can see with the test failing, you will need to account for the added styled text of the path in the compareStyleRanges. I would suggest having compareStyleRanges become:
compareStyleRanges(Position[] expected, StyleRange[] actual, String fileName, String fileParentPath)
and outside of the for loop checking the given positions, add:
assertEquals("Start of file path StyleRange is incorrect.", expected[i].offset, fileName.length());
assertEquals("Length of file path StyleRange at index is incorrect.", expected[i].length, 3 + project.getName().length() + fileParentPath.length());

This would avoid having to do the calculations within each test and for testBug531610() you can do:
compareStyleRanges(withDigits, ranges,"file", withFolder ? "/folder" : "");

Thanks a lot for your reply. 

The problem that I'm facing with your proposed solution is that it still fails because it expects one style range less than it gets. This is the case for all tests in this class. The corresponding line for this issue is 210. That would mean that I either add a Position element to each test call or rework what getStyleRanges returns. What would you propose for this?

If we always expect to have expected length to be one more than actual length:

assertEquals("Length of StyleRanges is incorrect: " + printStyleRanges(actual), expected.length, actual.length);
for (int i = 0; i < actual.length; i++) {

Becomes:

assertEquals("Length of StyleRanges is incorrect: " + printStyleRanges(actual), expected.length + 1, actual.length);
int i;
for (i = 0; i < actual.length - 1; i++) { ...

so that the i can be used proceeding file path rage checks.
