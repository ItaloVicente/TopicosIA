"do not know" is no argument to add the filter. Please investigate and if you think the change is OK, i.e. not changing API, please file a bug report against PDE API Tools.

Will do. Did you look at the code change? Maybe the deletion of the redundant overriden methods is an API change? I don't think so but you may know better.

No, I did not have time for that right now. It's mainly Jens and your task to look into it and file a bug report with details. I can then take a look.

The code change was really small. I understand that time is an issue for you but maybe consider spending a minute or so looking at the code before writing long comments, you may same time on both our sides.

If you do not plan to contribute to the solution, I suggest that you remove your -1 so that we can fix this issue for all committers while still investigating the root cause.

A filter is not needed here. The minor version should be increased (-> 1.8.0.qualifier) because the methods are removed from MultiList. However, it's not a breaking change.

I will remove my -1 once a new patch set is uploaded with the version change.

Thanks to Vikas to confirm that this was causing the issue.

Yes, the deletion is the (non-breaking) change. It doesn't report an addition as the methods in the superclass were already there.
