DESCRIPTION:

Bug 540222 - All test projects should dump stack traces on timeout

When running tests with org.eclipse.test.EclipseTestRunner during
integration builds, stack traces and screenshots are provided if the
build times out (e.g. due to a hang in the tests). When running test
projects with maven however (e.g. when jdt.debug.tests run in a Gerrit
job), no such stack traces or screenshots are present. Debugging
sporadic hangs in Gerrit jobs is therefore very difficult.

This change is preparation for adding the dumps from EclipseTestRunner
to Gerrit jobs, i.e it copies code from EclipseTestRunner to
TestableObject. We choose TestableObject as its is available in plug-ins
which define test applications.

No. I see no hint from which project / repo the code is coming. I hint like "the files are copied from xyz repository and left mostly untouched" would be good. Most of the "new" code doesn't make sense without historical context and f you would write it from scratch, it would look completely different.
