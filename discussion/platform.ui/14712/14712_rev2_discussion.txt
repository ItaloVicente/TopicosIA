That's a somewhat large formatting change that I don't want to submit.  Also, it added this. in front of a lot of fields, and we don't don that.  I'm not willing to accept those changes.

I'm just curious what's wrong with some formatting changes?
Also, what's wrong with prefixing by a "this." ?

Our policy is to only reformat code that's being changed (so it's clear what the fix is about).

As for "this." we don't use it in platform UI.  Most of the this. weren't related to new variables in use but existing variables/segments of code that were fine the way they were.
