For me, this does not work. My test:
1.) Empty the Location field in the launch configuration
2.) Start a runtime Eclipse
3.) Select a WS -> afterward I still see a flickering

Hmm, do you have any plug-ins enabled when launching a runtime Eclipse? It seems to work for me when I launch with all plug-ins.

I have the modified org.eclipse.ui.workbench include in the runtime. Not sure if I understood your question correctly, please clarify is that was not your question.

Sorry, I was just wondering if you have any plug-ins launched with child Eclipse in the Plug-ins tab under Run Configurations, that may have caused the splash screen to be different. I can't seem to reproduce the issue with this patch on my machine.

I cleaned my workspace and I can confirm that the flickering is gone, see https://imgur.com/a/MNVYn4w.

I still see an empty gray shell (see screencast), in the best scenario this shell would not be shown until the splash is ready. Xi WDYT?

Yeah, I can see the blank splash screen when the workspace is unavailable. I think this is the same issue describe in bug 427393 comment 21, which seems unrelated to this change.
