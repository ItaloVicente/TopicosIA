Build and test are OK, but Eclipse project is currently in a code freeze period.
Please wait for end of code freeze period before merging.

I think a change like this makes it unnecessarily hard for adopters of the Eclipse IDE. Documentation has to be updated (outdated screenshots), terminology has to be explained (What is a project folder and what makes it different from a project that is subsequently referred to all over the UI), confusion arises (why Java Project, Plug-in Project but Project Folder)?

I'm not a committer on platform but only a user, but I doubt that a change like this with all its implications on the consistency in the UI is helpful.
Line:55, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/plugin.properties -> More questions asked than answered. What kind of metadata? Who is creating that? Where is it stored?

Line:57, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/plugin.properties -> "Create a new folder resource to a project" sounds wrong to me.

Line:57, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/plugin.properties -> Yes, my mistake. I initially wrote "into" and found it didn't sound so good. I meant to keep just "in" and mechanically deleted the "in" to accidentally keep the "to".
Would "in" be find here?
