DESCRIPTION:

Bug 560100 - [Project Explorer] Allow user disable "inline rename"

This change adds a preference to disable inline rename for the Project
Explorer view. The preference is available under Window -> Preferences
-> General. It can also be configured via product customization, with
the line:

org.eclipse.ui.workbench/RESOURCE_RENAME_MODE=dialog

Per default, inline rename remains on.

Line:395, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/WorkbenchPreferencePage.java -> this will always set to inline mode. However, it should set to the default from preference store (product customization value).

Can you be more specific? Do you mean bug 560091 or bug 560113?

Do you mean, we want to also fix the inline rename that also results in a dialog? And in this change?

I haven't tried that yet, but the comments in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=560091 indicate that RenameResourceHandler is affected / involved.

Still not following. You mean https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=560091#c6 ?

isCompositeChange in org.eclipse.ltk.internal.ui.refactoring.actions.RenameResourceHandler.performRename(ExecutionEvent)

returns true and thus dialog is opened
"

Normally if the rename would result in a composite change, the inline rename should not even show. But we are disabling it anyway, so why do we care? I thought we wanted to disable inline renaming in our product and not deal with the rest of the problems it brings?

Or do we want to fix also bug 560091? And if so, wouldn't it make sense to fix it with another review for bug 560091?

I just wanted you to follow up on the bug above and to check if we need to change *also* the RenameResourceHandler or not, without debugging this all by myself.

Beside this: can you please address the comments above & upload the fixed patch?
