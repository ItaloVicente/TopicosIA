Carsten would you be so kind to first do a review on code style yourself, before I spend my time on this? I only looked at the first file.
Line:337, bundles/org.eclipse.core.commands/src/org/eclipse/core/commands/ParameterizedCommand.java -> Incorrect identation

Hi Rolf, I did not yet separate the version bump. Other than that I hope I applied your suggestions.

Line:337, bundles/org.eclipse.core.commands/src/org/eclipse/core/commands/ParameterizedCommand.java -> Can you point me to a documentation where to lookup in which way this is wrong and maybe how to configure eclipse to consider this when doing a ctrl-I?

Line:337, bundles/org.eclipse.core.commands/src/org/eclipse/core/commands/ParameterizedCommand.java -> General documentation: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Conventions_and_Guidelines
Eclipse mostly follows 'Oracle's Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language'

For this particular instance, ctrl-l does only work correctly if you select the whole block, also ctrl-shift-f does not work correctly. Most likely because the comment is at the start of the line.
I always use ctrl-shift-f to format my code (which is also triggered on save for many projects, for lines that are changed).

In general, I think these save actions could help you. However, as you are using scripts to change this code, I don't think it works well together.

Carsten, can you finish this one fast? Otherwise I can have a look via a separate change.

Hi Lars, please feel free to abandon. I honestly must admit that I did not find the formatting problem Rolf pointed me to. Maybe he is talking about "ignore" message, dunno - did not find a violation according to the documentation. Anyway - please abandon this and the other open gerrits which you want to take over. 
Thanks - and thanks Rolf for your review!
