Why does this have to be in a different bundle instead of in org.eclipse.jface? The split package is a no-go.
Line:9, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.widgets/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> If this is internal, how is one supposed to use these widgets?

Line:9, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.widgets/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This package exists in org.eclipse.jface. Avoid split packages.

Line:11, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.widgets/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This is wrong.

Line:20, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.widgets/build.properties -> Doesn't exist?

Line:14, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.widgets/plugin.properties -> This is wrong.

File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.jface.widgets/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/.gitignore -> This file can be deleted now that there is content beneath this directory.
Line:126, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.widgets/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/floatingtext/FloatingText.java -> What's the reason for not doing pStlye & ~(SWT.BORDER|SWT.SEPARATOR) ?

But anyway: you do realize that SWT.SEPARATOR == SWT.MULTI? Might that be a reason for the "sometimes working" mentioned in bug 328832?

Thank you for the review, Thomas. We are not ready with it yet, but your review is very much appreciated and you caught a nasty bug. I hope you are right about it and it was the reason for 328832. All other issues are ACK. I will fix them.
Line:9, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.widgets/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> ACK. It was out of caution.

Line:126, bundles/org.eclipse.jface.widgets/src/org/eclipse/jface/widgets/floatingtext/FloatingText.java -> Yes, it is weird. I will change it.

> SWT.SEPARATOR == SWT.MULTI
Could well be. I will take a look. Great catch! Thank you.

Yes it is. See bug 328832 comment 5. (Checked only Cocoa; behavior is identical as stated in the bug, which was reported against Win32.)
