> Ben, from experience I know what the MenuManagerRender is quite fragile. There are some (incorrect) assumptions which break code easily. Would you be able to add some test-cases for this scenario? So that we can check that the functionallity works correctly, and keeps working in the future.

I have added a test for this. Please review again.

Hi Ben,

I did start a review some time ago, see the comment. Note that this is a rough comment, more like a brain dump still. Couldn't find more time to review it, as said its all quite complex.
Your testcase test one happy flow scenario, in a very limited scope, still can't guarantee correct interaction with more complex scenarios, like merging of menus.

I will try to look again, and see if your solution addresses one case, without breaking stuff. I don't expect that this change solves the general case.

Line:792, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/MenuManagerRenderer.java -> In the current implementation, a (recursive) call to the reconcile on the added menu must be done, such that the menu items are also synchronized to the model.
Moreover, in ContributionRecord#mergeIntoModel it is checked if the menu is already there. When the menu is pre-existing the children of the menu are added to the model. In this case, the children are not added to the model yet, i.e. the reconcile on the model is not called yet. Therefore, the reconcile must be called in the Factory code too. In the renderer for the general case, in the factory to handle pre-existing elements. However, I cannot imagine what happens when merging a opaque element with another one. Though this situation might already be triggered in code.
