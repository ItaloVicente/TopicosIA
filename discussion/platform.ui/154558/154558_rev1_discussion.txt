DESCRIPTION:

Bug 553089 - Handle premature closing of view before load finished

When the log view is closed while reading the log, the view is disposed
and widget updates happen later. This can be simulated by a Thread sleep
in fetchLogEntries() and closing the view meanwhile.

This uncovered also a missing null guard in PartSite#getShell().

Moved call to readLogFile() in createPartControl() down, since premature
closing calls dispose() and the controls are not created then.

See comments below.
Line:226, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> Trailing space

Line:875, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> I assume this is left over from tests

Line:877, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> Note, at this point view could be already gone.

Line:889, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> If I read it right, we enter this code now asynchronously. Means, all the work from the first line could be not needed / lead to some errors.

Line:898, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> I would extract the inverse of it to isDisposed() and use it.

Line:906, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> will be null after view disposal.

PlatformUI.getWorkbench().getDisplay() is our friend.

Line:435, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/PartSite.java -> please revert all changes here, they are not needed / hide errors where code tries to re-use disposed parts.

Line:13, /COMMIT_MSG -> It is not missing, it is intentional.

Line:875, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> No, this should be production code ;)

Line:877, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> Yes. I think additional check here is not necessary. This would be a very rare situation and would only lead to a bit obsolete background processing.

Line:889, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> right. unnecessary work is not problematic IMO. Errors should only be possible by access to disposed elements.

Line:898, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> I hope I got what you meant

Line:906, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.log/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/log/LogView.java -> Thanks! There are many other places where this may be used then, too.

Line:435, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/PartSite.java -> OK
