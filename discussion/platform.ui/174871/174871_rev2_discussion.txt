I will not block it but I'm not delighted to put two of the same methods in PlatformUI. It looks like an afterthought. It is not a big deal to use FrameworkUtil.

As an alternative we can change the signature of getDialogSettings to Object. We would not break BC and people can pass a Bundle, a Class and even any object. WDYT?

ps
in extremis we could also allow null to be passed and use an exception to detect the calling class.

Fine for me, so I abandon?

Both alternatives sound bad to me.

I do not want to block it. It's up to you.

What is your objection to the "Object" alternative? It's unconventional but it does not really matter what people pass.

Lets see what Matthias thinks, I like shorter API calls but don't insist on this shorter API.

Object implies that any type can be passed. Having typed methods has the advantage that users know what can be passed without reading the Javadoc.

I am ok with abandoning it.
