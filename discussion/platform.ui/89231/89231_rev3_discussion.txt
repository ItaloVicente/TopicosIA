We still use Eclipse 3.8.2 because we can't update to Eclipse 4.X, because of this bug in compatibility layer. A full migration to Eclipse e4 is not possible for use, because it would be too much effort compared to the benefits. There are some others facing the same problem.

I already tested the implementation by hand and it seems to work.
I also tried to activate the suggested unit tests in org.eclipse.ui.tests.api.IWorkbenchPageTest. There are quite a lot tests deactivated there. About the half of the test cases related to these 2 methods work instantly. I think that the others are no deal breakers, but they have to be adapted somehow. For me it is quite difficult to do this task taking all necessary aspects into account.
So I want to ask, if someone who is already familiar with the internal implementation of WorkbenchPage, could have a look at it. For me it would take a lot of time to get used to this implementation, while maybe someone else can solve it within an hour and in better quality.

I checked out this patch and enabled the tests in IWorkbenchPageTest. It looks like the editors are not even hidden when calling hideEditor(). At least not in testOpenAndHideEditor5() for example. I tried to debug, but actually it all looks ok when stepping through. But the opened IDE for the tests does not change.
Honestly I don't understand what is going on there and if something deeper in the E4 platform code or compat layer is not working correctly here.
Would need more time to investigate to find out what is wrong here.

Does not work, because new Editor instance is created on show.
