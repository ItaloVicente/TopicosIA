As mentioned on my previous comment, I don't think that patches fixes the root cause when it comes to compatibility editor (and maybe others). The root cause is more that this editorId is requested at startup, this patch just silents the issue without resolving it.
Please share 
Please provide steps to reproduce the issue so we can investigate why those ids are requested in 1st place.

That belongs to the overall patch series. Please continue discussing on bug, so everyone interested is involved.

Current patch fixes regression introduced by previous patches, so I'm going to merge that.
