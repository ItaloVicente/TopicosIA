@Lars: do you have any idea why this non-existing editor (that seems to come from e4, maybe a proxy?) is requested at startup; and -even more interesting- how could we prevent this from happening?

Build and test are OK, but Eclipse project is currently in a code freeze period.
Please wait for end of code freeze period before merging.

This editor exists, it is bundleclass://org.eclipse.ui.workbench/org.eclipse.ui.internal.e4.compatibility.CompatibilityEditor. The IDE basicually wraps every editor into this class.

You can check this via the model spy from http://download.eclipse.org/e4/snapshots/org.eclipse.e4.tools/latest/ and select Windows -> Spies -> Model Spy I attach a screenshot to the bug. 

Not sure about the external editor handling. As this editor is just a wrapper, I would not have expected a call to external editor for it.

And all editors using this class have the same ID? Basically they're not recoverable just by the id? Wouldn't it be better to have the workbench storing the wrapped editor id rather than the wrapper's id?

IIRC the editor uses the real editor number as ID, I don't know for certain. This was implemented by the IBM team before my time and I never investigated this in detail. 

I think the patch here looks good.

At the moment, I'm not comfortable with adding in the editor registry a specific execution patch for one specific id that is not even in the dependencies.
I think we can find something better and more correct in term of dependency flow, probably not in the registry though.
