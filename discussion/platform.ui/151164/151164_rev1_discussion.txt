help

Removed extra "Help" related code that seem do not match to the overall
design. That fixes NPE as a side effect.

Mickael, what was the purpose of that extra handling of "help" provider? It looks as it is not needed at all, and only causes troubles?

I don't know, this is from before I worked on the Quick Access. I guess one idea was that the "help" entry would always be visible even if all other providers had more entries to show.
But that doesn't seem to be a valid argument to me, and your proposal here looks much better.
