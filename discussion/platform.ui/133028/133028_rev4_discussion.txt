DESCRIPTION:

Bug 23862 - [PropertiesView] Properties view doesn't update when
switching between editors

Fix: Instead of showing properties for 'the last structural selection
that was made while the default properties view page was visible',
properties will be showed for the current active part.

With this patch:
1. A new default page (message page) is shown, when the current part
does not provide a properties page or is not a ISelectionProvider
   - Incorrect disposal of the old default page is fixed as with this
well
2. Each part gets its own properties view page, except for contributing
parts
3. The PropertySheet does not listen to the global selection provider,
but only to the selection provider of the current active part.
4. When the selection to the PropertySheetPage is not a IStructured
selection or when the selection is empty, the part (or contributing
part) is provide as input to the viewer.
5. An adaptor is added to show the IFile properties when a IEditorPart
is provided as input to the properties viewer.

Rolf, I fear the timing for this review is pretty bad. Next week I'm back to the office from vacations, so I will have not a minute free for a serious review, plus we have M1 stabilization week. I can't guarantee, but I will try to find some time in one-two weeks from now. If I will not respond timely, just ping me here.

Ping, a release cycle later already. But I understand that reviewing this change might take some more time.

I'm sorry, there are too many things with higher priority. Could you please ask on the platform mailing list for a review?

Rolf, looks like no one has time or desire to review this patch. If you feel reasonable confident with the solution, I suggest to merge it early in the next release cycle so that it receives good testing during the development phase.
