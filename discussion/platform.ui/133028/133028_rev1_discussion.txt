DESCRIPTION:

Bug 23862 - [PropertiesView] Properties view doesn't update when
switching between editors

Fix: Instead of showing properties for 'the last structural selection
that was made while the default properties view page was visible',
properties will be showed for the current active part.

With this patch:
1. Each part gets its own properties view page, except for contributing
parts
2. A new default page (message page) is shown, when the current part
does not provide a properties page or is not a ISelectionProvider
   - Incorrect disposal of the old default page is fixed as with this
well
3. When the selection to the PropertySheetPage is not a IStructured
selection or when the selection is empty, the part (or contributing
part) is provide as input to the viewer.
4. An adaptor is added to show the IFile properties when a IEditorPart
is provided as input to the properties viewer.
