DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 535679: load quick access elements in a job

The quick access field (top right corner of Eclipse UI) loads previously
called elements on creation. This has two drawbacks. First, for
previously called commands, handlers of all defined commands are loaded.
And second, loading an element can e.g. involve IO and so block the UI
for a substantial amount of time.

This change moves loading of elements to a job. The loading is indicated
by a message in the quick access dialog. The job is provided with a
progress monitor that can be cancelled. If cancelled, not all quick
access elements will be restored.

Furthermore CommandProvider is adjusted to not load all commands when a
specific command is requested via
CommandProvider.getElementForId(String).

This change is unfinished; it contains a bare minimum of changes to
examine the new behavior and check if the new behavior desired.

Instead of using new Job you could use Job create(String name, final ICoreRunnable runnable) to create the job. As ICoreRunnable is a functional interface you could use a lambda expression or method reference as second parameter.

Is this understandable?

I suggest finishing this by getting rid of the test delay and the [WIP] in the commit message so that this can be merged. 

Change looks good to me.
