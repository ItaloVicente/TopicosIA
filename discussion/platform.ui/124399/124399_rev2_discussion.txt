DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 535679: load quick access elements in a job

The quick access field (top right corner of Eclipse UI) loads previously
called elements on creation. This has two drawbacks. First, for
previously called commands, handlers of all defined commands are loaded.
And second, loading an element can e.g. involve IO and so block the UI
for a substantial amount of time.

This change moves loading of elements to a job and disables the quick
access field until this job finishes. The job is provided with a
progress monitor that can be cancelled. If cancelled, not all quick
access elements will be restored.

Furthermore CommandProvider is adjusted to not load all commands when a
specific command is requested via
CommandProvider.getElementForId(String).

This change is unfinished; it contains a bare minimum of changes to
examine the new behavior and check if the new behavior desired.

Could the job creation moved to a private field? Reading deep nestled structures is harder IMHO.

Sure, if its decided that the job is what we want I'll refactor and update the review.

Line:616, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> AFAIK jobs usually use Capital letter at the beginning.

Line:672, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> If you use split the cancle check is down automatically and you can remove line 644

+1 to the idea of using a job. 

But I don't think we need to disable the field though. If the search history is not yet restored, the field can still be active.

I think this would require some sort of indication that there are still loading entries. Otherwise as a user I would wonder where my entries are if loading takes exceptionally long? Any suggestions how that hint may look?

We would also need synchronization on the containers, since they'll be filled from UI thread by user (I think) and from the new job.

Entry in the list which says "Previously selected entries still loading.."
