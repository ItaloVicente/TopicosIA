DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Bug 535679: load quick access elements in a job

The quick access field (top right corner of Eclipse UI) loads previously
called elements on creation. This has two drawbacks. First, for
previously called commands, handlers of all defined commands are loaded.
And second, loading an element can e.g. involve IO and so block the UI
for a substantial amount of time.

This change moves loading of elements to a job and disables the quick
access field until this job finishes. The job is provided with a
progress monitor that can be cancelled. If cancelled, not all quick
access elements will be restored.

Furthermore CommandProvider is adjusted to not load all commands when a
specific command is requested via
CommandProvider.getElementForId(String).

This change is unfinished; it contains a bare minimum of changes to
examine the new behavior and check if the new behavior desired.

File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> If elements are being restored, a line of red text is now shown at the top of the quick access pop-up. This is where a line usually is shown, telling the user to start typing.

The user can still use the field, and their choices will be added to the restored choices.

I'm not too sure what to do with the job upon destruction of the SearchField though (SearchField.dispose()). Cancel I guess?
