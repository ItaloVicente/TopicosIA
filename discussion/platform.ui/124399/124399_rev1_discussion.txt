DESCRIPTION:

Bug 535679: load quick access elements in a job

The quick access field (top right corner of Eclipse UI) loads previously
called elements on creation. This has two drawbacks. First, for
previously called commands, handlers of all defined commands are loaded.
And second, loading an element can e.g. involve IO and so block the UI
for a substantial amount of time.

This change moves loading of elements to a job and disables the quick
access field until this job finishes. The job is provided with a
progress monitor that can be cancelled. If cancelled, not all quick
access elements will be restored.

Furthermore CommandProvider is adjusted to not load all commands when a
specific command is requested via
CommandProvider.getElementForId(String).

This change is unfinished; it contains a bare minimum of changes to
examine the new behavior and check if the new behavior desired.

As indicated in the commit comment, this is not finished work. Please examine behaviour and general change idea, then let me know if this is the direction we want to go in.
File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/CommandProvider.java -> I adapted retrieval of specific QuickAccessElements for commands, so that not all commands are loaded.

The new code can cause a different order of CommandProvider.getElements(). However getElements() already used a HashMap and packed its buckets into array for the result. So it didn't provide a specific order anyway.

Personally I can live without the changes here, considering the changes in SearchField. From my perspective its just messy to load everything on start-up; this is not really called for.
Line:616, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> The tooltip is unfortunately not shown if the SWT Text is not enabled (GTK 3.22).

I'm not sure how to express why the Text is disabled, i.e. that elements are still being loaded.

Line:640, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> To illustrate "slow" loading of elements. If you have many quick access entries, its probably best to reduce this sleep time.

Line:680, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Also a system job?

I think the convention is to use [WIP] in the commit header for unfinished work. Makes it easier to spot that this is not yet finished compared to a note in the commit message.

Line:614, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/SearchField.java -> Ctrl+3 still works, I'll need to disable it here as well (and re-enable later on).
