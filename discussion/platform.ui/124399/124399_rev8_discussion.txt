DESCRIPTION:

Bug 535679: load quick access elements in a job

The quick access field (top right corner of Eclipse UI) loads previously
called elements on creation. This has two drawbacks. First, for
previously called commands, handlers of all defined commands are loaded.
And second, loading an element can e.g. involve IO and so block the UI
for a substantial amount of time.

This change moves loading of elements to a job. The loading is indicated
by a message in the quick access dialog. The job is provided with a
progress monitor that can be cancelled. If cancelled, not all quick
access elements will be restored.

Furthermore CommandProvider is adjusted to not load all commands when a
specific command is requested via
CommandProvider.getElementForId(String).

Line:25, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/quickaccess/QuickAccessUiElementProvider.java -> So apparently this is a bad idea. I observe the following behavior (on master too):

Window 1 is created. Search field is created. Active window is WorkbenchWindow object X.

I open a second window. Window 2 is created. Search field is created. Active window is WorkbenchWindow object X *again*, lets call this problem (a).


This leads to the following behavior (master):

If a source AAA is open, and a previous choice was to "open source AAA", there is an entry in Window 1 to "open source AAA" (expected).

*The first time* when I open the quick access dialog in Window 2, I see a quick access entry "open source AAA". Clicking on this does nothing, since it targets Window 1 (see problem (a)) and AAA is already open there. If I closed AAA in Window 1, the quick access entry will re-open AAA in Window 1.

*The next time* I open the quick access dialog, the "open source AAA" entry is gone. This is the case, since the command providers are told to throw away their elements each time the quick access dialog is closed, if there was an entry coming from this command provider. Lets call this problem (b).

So problem (a) exists on master. Due to problem (b), problem (a) manifests only the first time the quick access is used.

Since here we cache the active workbench window, problem (a) manifests always.

I don't really know what to say about problem (b). Its surprising to say the least, but since everything is already loaded at start-up, probably this is not a big performance loss.
