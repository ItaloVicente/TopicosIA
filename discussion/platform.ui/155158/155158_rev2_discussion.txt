I am fairly confident that this patch works as intended. At least it brings back CPD functionality, such that it can be tested in M1.

Only issue that there might be is the ordering of menus, it can be different from the menu order as shown by the WorkBench. But that is fundamental, menu's will be show at the first place they become visible and will not move. In CPD we cannot predict where the menu was shown first. Most likely this will improve when menu items are properly added and removed from the model.

I will release it when the build if finished
