Line:107, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> maybe it would be good to make this a class instead of an inner one and passing the ModelAssembler instance in the constructor?

Line:225, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> SHould resolved bundles be included? Or only those who are started and/or LazyActivated?

Line:63, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> I wonder if it won't be possible to instead pass these to the EclipsContext used for construction?
Currently an empty context is created and filled with values given here, why not pass the Eclipse context with all values on the first place?

Line:107, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> This tracker as a very thight binding to the ModelAssembler. The tracker can not live without the ModelAssembler and it actually would not make sense to have the tracker without it. Even the instances have a tight coupling. The ModelAssembler on the other hand could live without the tracker.

So I would not see a benefit of extracting it. Why would you prefer a separation?

There are good arguments for both ways. I personally would not increase the visibility of methods and members (even package private) if i have such a strong coupling.

Line:225, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> I just noticed that "this bundle makes contribution to the UI" checkbox automatically activate the Lazy-Header and eclipse warns if I use extension-points but don't activate this header.

So a resolved bundle with Lazy-Activation should be in STARTING state, will be catched up here and then a class is loaded by the modelextender and then it is "really" started.

On the other hand if i explicitly STOP a bundle one might expect that the UI contributions are no longer available (as it is with DS components).

Line:225, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> AFAIK extension points are read when they are resolved. With a lazy activation otherwise a bundle that contributes to the UI would never be loaded as the UI contributions that are added via fragment would never be loaded otherwise.

So yes, resolved bundles need to be included, otherwise the contributions wouldn't be loaded anymore.

Line:225, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> Yes it would be nice if we could register/unregister fragments on bundle start/stop. But that could also break stuff or at least can cause some confusion.

If you look at org.eclipse.core.internal.registry.osgi.EclipseBundleListener you will see that the RESOLVED state is taken into account. So I would assume that the parsing of the MANIFEST for fragment loading is also done already in the RESOLVED state.

If a user adopts the new approach for registering a fragment with the MANIFEST header, there is no warning or any other hint that he/she has to set the lazy activation policy in order to get the fragment loaded.

But we can also sell this as a feature of the new way for registering a fragment. If you want it to be loaded on startup, set the lazy activation policy (just like bundles that contribute DS). If not, the bundle will not be started automatically. You will then need some programmatic way to start the bundle and trigger the handling of the contributed fragment.

I see good reasons for both approaches. The start/stop support would bring additional benefits. Maybe this discussion should be brought to a broader audience?

So I would assume that the parsing of the MANIFEST for fragment loading is also done already in the RESOLVED state.

I think the *parsing* should really be done in the RESOLVED state (and might gather information e.g if it includes references to other fragment contributions) as it won't change between restarts, but maybe just make them 'live' (aka create the Object for an MPart) in starting/started state?

> But we can also sell this as a feature of the new way for registering a fragment.

I think one might start with this 'new' approach and if it proven to be too problematic later "upgrade" to start things earlier? Or mabey we we can add second attribute ;start=lazy

> Maybe this discussion should be brought to a broader audience

Sure why not! Making this more dynamic is a really cool feature so thanks for taking care. one could even think about that in debugger-mode changes to a declared fragemnt are aromatically reloaded like it is done for classes then...

Line:63, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> No, I wouldn't do this. It could also change the way the injection is handled. There is a semantic. The main context is the context to retrieve the injected objects from. The localContext is the context to obtain additional objects from. I would not change the processing for additional model element injection that could have negative side effects as it would change the injection order.

Line:63, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> But creating an empty context also does not seem right here when processors need to declare what to get from the parent. So what about creating a child from the parent like this:
 IEclipsecontext child = eclipseContext.createChild("processor");
 ContextInjectionFactory.inject(object, child);
 child.dispose();

Line:63, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> A local context is created. If you would use the context that is used for creation, you would put application model elements on the workbench level context. This would break the context hierarchy injection rules.

BTW, this feature was probably never used, as the injection did never work because the wrong inject method was used. Just as a side node that I fixed this on the way too.

About the service properties, I know it adds a bit of overhead but remember from other changes that there are often concerns about "eager" activation of services and we better put the effort on a central place than on the client.

That would be great. I have the feeling that the ModelElement parts are more dependencies that need to be present? Maybe then a processor can only be created if some prerequisite model elements exits and its start has to be delayed?

My only concern here is that its rather vague what this ModelElement stuff actually does. As mentioned before I would even expect that all these details are part of the processor and we rather should give access in some way so the Service could create the model-processor on its own something like:

Object createProcessor(IEclipseContext);

then, even the isBeforeFragment/ApplyAttribute can become service properties instead of parts of the service interface. That way it would even be possible to consume services lazy, e.g a processor that does not match (yet) do not even needs to be instantiated.

Line:63, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> I think they don't get it from the parent actually. That is why the local context had to be introduced. The application model is not loaded completely at the point where the processors are executed. And in this state somehow an injection should be supported. At least I think that was the idea behind it. I haven't found real documentation on that, and as I said, it never worked before because of the wrong overloaded method being used. Anyhow I would really keep the injection at this point as it is. I think there was a reason for these local contexts, and this could be one of them.

If one of the original developers would put some light on this topic I will consider changing it. But I do not see a real reason to change the injection at this point without a reason.

Maybe again a topic to be discussed with a broader audience.

Line:63, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> The model element stuff seems to be a way to get model elements from the application model, that are already loaded in some way, can get injected additionally to a processor. And yes I suppose this introduces some timing concerns if the model element I need is not yet available. Probably one use case was to register a processor that programmatically modifies something that was contributed by the fragment in the same plugin. Which is the reason for the before/after fragment configuration.

Maybe you have not seen the latest changes here. I have added the option to have the @Execute method directly in the service. This way it is not necessary to create an additional processor instance. Although it is still possible as it was before. In case you use the service directly as the processor, you can also have a @PreDestroy which is necessary for the dynamics to revert modifications if necessary. And with @Execute in the service, you can also manually create and trigger whatever you want. I think that should satisfy all use cases.

About the service properties, well I can think about it. But that means I will need to change the whole registration again, because then I need to store the properties with the service instances for the initial processing.

Line:63, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> I just though of making it "reversed", using the "empty" context as the "injector context" and the global one as the "local"/"fallback", even though thats might look a bit strange it should suffice here:

 ContextInjectionFactory.inject(object, EclipseContextFactory.create(), eclipseContext);
