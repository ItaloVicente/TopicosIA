@Dirk I think this would be a great addition but the dynamic nature of services is not handled properly in my opinion. This is a bit related to a bug I stumbled over a while ago that currently it is not possible to "unattatch" a fragment e.g. when a bundle is shut down.
Line:104, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> This does not handle the dynamics needed for services, how will the code know that a new fragment is contributed or the bundle is gone?

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> it would be more flexible if the contribution itself is searched for a Execute annotation.
That way it won't be necessary to even have a default constructor and we could even have more Lifecycle Methods (comparable to the E4Lifecycle).
I even think that making this work like a LifeCycle handler can greatly enhance the usability.

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelFragmentContribution.java -> A more "OSGi" and declarative way would be to declare this in the manifest. This is the way its done for example in DS, and JPA Service specification.
a header might looks like this:

Model-Fragment: /fragment.e4xmi;apply=always

Line:104, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> Right now the whole process of model loading does not respect dynamics. The ModelAssembler is created using ContextInjectionFactory in ResourceHandler. IIUC the instance is created, then processModel() is called, then the instance will be dropped as it is not stored anywhere.

I could change the injection to method injection which would then lead to re-injecting the list of available services. But the @Service injection has no similar behavior to OSGi DS where we get informed that a particular service is not available anymore. And since the ModelAssembler is not persisted at runtime, it would also not help.

@Tom Please correct me if I am wrong, but as of now there are no dynamics supported. Or do you see a way we could add such a support?

Of course it would be nice if we could even support the service dynamics for the fragment contribution. This could add the possibility to really load/unload model contributions at runtime without the need to reload. But as of now I don't see that possibility. But it could be an improvement build on top of this patch.

Line:104, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> Despite the timing, does it make a difference?

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelFragmentContribution.java -> I agree from the usage/OSGi point of view. But that would mean to implement logic that scans the MANIFEST files of all plugins in the runtime in search for the header, right? And that would be done in the main thread, which would have negative effect on the startup time, as building the application model is done in the main thread. For a big RCP application that would mean to scan hundreds of MANIFEST files. Or do I see things wrong here.

Line:44, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelFragmentContribution.java -> open for improvements. could you give me a pointer what you mean exactly. I suppose you have examples somewhere that I could adapt. 😊

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> but that would also mean that model processors need to implement an interface, which was not necessary before. I again agree with your statements, but I am not sure how intrusive this would be. A simple move from plugin.xml to DS for registering a processor is then not possible. You need to change your processor implementation aswell. And having more lifecycle methods does probably not work as the processor itself should be called only at specific time slots. Adding more execution fragments inside a processor doesn't make the whole startup logic easier.

Line:104, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> I think that the ModelAssembler has to be a DS component itself to make this work reliable. the "non dynamics" is one of the biggest problem currently.

What do you think about the following process:
1) ModelAssembler is a DS component
2) ResourceHandler uses eclipseContext.get(ModelAssembler.class) to get the service
3) ResourceHandler calls ContextInjectionFactory.inject(service, eclipseContext);
4) ResourceHandler calls ContextInjectionFactory.invoke(service, PostConstruct.class, eclipseContext)

That way a proper injection as well as notifications are guaranteed.

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelFragmentContribution.java -> No one forces you to do this in the mainthread :-)
Beside this, currently all "plugin.xml" are scanned so if its a service then DS will scan all manifests... so in the end there there is not so much difference and if not the modelassembler then anyone else will scan the manifests.

One could even think about having an extender listening for bundles come-and-go and register corresponding ModelProcessor services.

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> I don't see much difference in implementing this in a separate class. Implementation has to change anyways. If I don't like to merge both into one class I could still separate them (e.g

@Execute
void execute(IEclipseContext ctx) {
  inst =  ContextInjectionFacory.create(MyProcessor.class, ctx);
  ContextInjectionFacory.invoke(inst, Execute.class, ctx);
}

would be possible.

The main point is, that the whole control is at the IModelProcessorContribution, e.g if it likes to track other services and pass them to the actual model processor, or if it likes to invalidate/take don/update the processor instance and so on.

Line:104, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> Well, I think this can cause severe problems in the future. With this change the ModelAssembler will be a single instance managed by the SCR. Additionally we use Eclipse injection to set states. Which makes it also managed by Eclipse. So we are mixing two injection mechanisms bi-directionally. While this will probably work in some way, there will be side-effects we do not see yet. IIRC we already came to such points in several places were workarounds were added instead of a real solution.

OSGi services and the SCR injection I see as the base layer. Eclipse injection is the mechanism on a higher level. The @Service annotation was introduced to easily get services from the base layer to the upper layer. But the opposite direction feels incorrect. Invoking a method via Eclipse injection on an OSGi service is fine from my point of view, as it does not create references for the re-injection. But injecting fields to get the object in the correct state is dangerous.

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelFragmentContribution.java -> As we are talking about the application model, which is the base for the UI that should be rendered, it has to be executed in the main thread. Even if executed in a parallel thread, the UI will have to wait until the application model is completely loaded. So it is a blocking operation.

Yes all plugin.xml files are scanned on startup. And IIRC this is also done in the main thread. The SCR scans the manifest files in the SCR thread. Of course someone needs to scan the MANIFEST or anything else. But at the time the ModelAssembler is called, the services should be already there. If the ModelAssembler has to scan the MANIFEST files again, we introduce new processing overhead. Although I really agree that the MANIFEST solution is the better OSGi solution and it looks cleaner.

I compared the service approach showed here with inspecting the manifest header in ModelAssembler. The service approach takes about 10 ms to process. The inspection of the manifest header takes about 40 ms in a small Eclipse RCP application. I suppose the more plugins there are, the longer it will take.

On the other hand I am not sure if my service approach will always work in a big RCP application because of timing and the SCR thread. Maybe I should try to setup a scenario with the Eclipse IDE as base application to get better numbers.

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> Well changing your model processor implementation to implement the IModelProcessorContribution interface shouldn't be a big deal, I agree. But then I would actually create the option to support both ways. Either the IModelProcessorContribution has an @Execute method or a processor class. Then adopters have the choice to keep the existing model processor as is and just provide the component for the registration, or change the implementation to directly become the IModelProcessorContribution.

Your proposal expects that users are aware on how to use the injection programmatically. And that is very often not the case. ;)

BTW, I am not an EMF expert, but from looking into the code there is currently only a merge option available. There is no option to remove the contributions provided by a fragment from the application model as of now. Not sure how much effort it would be to add such funtionality.

I'm neither an EMF expert, I think Ed could know a lot about it :-)

Anyways it MUST be possible in some way as I can happily create / remove / update any elements at runtime.

For example I have implemented a dynamic license check for one of my applications: When the user unplugs the license device a dialog ask him to connect it again. If the user refuses to do so, the license bundles are shut-down and I modify the model by removing Views+Perspectives (btw this works all dynamic with services), but of course I need to scan the fragment.xmi to find out what belongs to the bundle that is disabled.

And that where I think ModelAssembler should kick in: It needs to keep track of bundles that contribute to the Model (and in that case also the Header-Scanning would be essentially a no-op!), store the element that where contributed and remove those if the bundle is gone or refreshed.
Line:104, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> > Well, I think this can cause severe problems in the future

I think the current approach will even more problematic. This will introduce all kind of start order dependency problem, using invalidated classes and so on.

> The @Service annotation was introduced to easily get services from the base layer to the upper layer

IMO @Service can reliable only be used on short term execution handlers due to its inability to notify about changes in the service layer.

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelFragmentContribution.java -> That's why I think the ModelAssembler needs to be "dynamic aware". In that case the parts scanning on the bundles (the Manifest don't needs to be parsed as this is done by OSGi already!) can happen in a separate thread and contribute to the ModelAssembler the final parsed data.

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> I thing we shouldn't pollute the interface with such "convinence" stuff. If someone has no idea about E4 and no idea about OSGi its probably better not to use the modelprocessor interface.

Passing class objects to create instance from it are always problematic and only work nice for simple cases. The main advantage of a Service approach versus a xml/declarative one is that I have more control about the created instance and its life-cycle.

Actually I would like to first add an option to contribute a fragment and/or processor via DS and not via extension point. The way in this patch will actually provide the same un-dynamic approach as with the extension points. Once the service interfaces are acknowledged we can think about changing the ModelAssembler to support dynamics. This will be definitely a bigger change.
Line:104, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> I will need to investigate the startup order topic.

The statement about @Service is not correct. It was introduced to actually bring the support for dynamics to the Eclipse layer, which does not exist with the default injection. In case you use a List for the injection, changes in the service layer will cause a re-injection of the list with the updated services. And it also supports the service.rank correctly.
What you don't have is the same processing as DS event binding. You do not have an explicit unbind, which makes it more complicated to handle bundle stops.

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelFragmentContribution.java -> Yes OSGi already parses the manifest. But still you have to iterate over all bundles and inspect the header data. That is four times slower than the service injection. I will update with some data when added to an IDE.

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> IMHO a platform/framework should exactly do this. Provide convenience over technical detail knowledge. Developers were able to implement a processor without such detailed knowledge before. Why should that be different with this approach? The message goes into the wrong direction for a platform committer! But maybe my idea is not clear enough. I will provide a suggestion for better understanding.

For me in first place the advantage is to drop the plugin.xml and the extension point usage. The next thing is of course the dynamic support of services compared to extension points. But maybe that should be then a topic for a next step. The extension point support can not be dropped completely for backwards compatibility.

But what is the advantage if it does not support any dynamics? If its just for the sake to get rid of plugin.xml a Manifest-Header would much more suffice for that than a service.

>  The way in this patch will actually provide the same un-dynamic approach as with the extension points.
I think this is the completely wrong approach here, what is the benefit of this? I can't take any advantage of a DS then (late binding, management of dependencies, restart / rebinding) but will add a lots of complexity without any gain. I even would find this dangerous as one keypoint of services is that the service provider do not need to mind the dynamics, we revert this completely here.

> Once the service interfaces are acknowledged we can think about changing the ModelAssembler to support dynamics.

I think this is the wrong order (and thus I'll change to even -2 here), if dynamics is not part of this changes its clearly a perquisite for that as it contradicts the whole service concept not supporting it and is a constant source of subtile bugs.

>  This will be definitely a bigger change.
The lets star with that. A minimal viable increment would be:
1) have a bundle that contributes a view to the model
2) if the bundle stops, the view goes away
3) if the bundle starts, the view is available again
Line:104, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/ModelAssembler.java -> From an OSGi POV the statement is correct. If you don't have the ability to free resources if a service is gone (the bundle do not need to be stopped for this) this introduces leaks of service references, anyways I think this is not the point here.

Line:26, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelFragmentContribution.java -> I really can't believe that. 10ms vs 40ms is really nothing one can reliable measure in a complex RCP startup procedure the time is simply taken somewhere else. For example how do you measure the "service injection time"? Is it the time E4 needs to set the field? collect service references? Make the actual service available in the service registry? How many services are to be fetched?

A service requires an active (or lazy activated) bundle, it requires firing Service Events, creating objects, registering listeners a classloader creation for the bundle and sometimes triggers even activation of other bundles and services. This can't be considerable faster than a simple hash-map lookup for a key.

Just for the sake of getting a measure I have added the following code to one of my applications:

 long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
 Bundle[] bundles = context.getBundles();
 LongAdder adder = new LongAdder();
 Arrays.stream(bundles).filter(b -> b.getHeaders("").get("Extension-Name") != null).forEach(x -> adder.increment());
 long end = System.currentTimeMillis();

fetching and filtering 615 bundles took 3 ms and yields 31 results with a variation from 2 to 10 ms thats even near the resolution one could expect to get from System.currentTimeMillis

I even tried to further optimize that

 Arrays.stream(bundles).parallel().unordered()

but this even yields slower results as the overhead of parallelization here is even much higher than the gain.


Beside of that a Manifest/resource lookup can even happen if the bundle is not active or even resolved (yet).

Line:36, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/modeling/IModelProcessorContribution.java -> The problem is that we are getting another "we cant change because API and must support this for years" here then.

The only "hybrid" solution i could think of would be a "Object createProcessor(IEclipseContext)" or something.

Just to get it right. You are against this minimal improvement as a starting point because it does not solve an issue that the Eclipse platform has since the early days of Eclipse 3. Is that correct?

Well I will try to find a solution that satisfies you and introduces ground breaking changes in how the application starts instead of adding an additional way to contribute a fragment/processor. But for such a change I will need more time as there are several possible side effects and lifecycles to consider then. And I also have to learn about EMF and how dynamically removing stuff from the application model using a fragment.e4xmi.

As you on the other hand also don't like the fragment contribution via DS and want a MANIFEST header, I will check how this could be done using a bundle listener. Also nothing I had in mind in first place, but well...

Don't get me wrong I really like the idea, but it makes only sense to add it if dynamics are supported.

I just see the risk, that if we add the interfaces now and later on see that for real dynamics we need another concept or need to adjust the behavior it would be much harder to change (as it has become API) than doing it the other way round.

I also know it will be hard to add dynamics but see this as an essential part if we like to move forward. Just adding another way of "non dynamics" feels wrong and would just complicate it.

Just let me know if I can help in this area, having the dynamics will help with other issues as well in that area.

I don't know if it is possible (using existing classes) to transform a fragemnt.e4xmi into a IModelProcessorContribution that would be a good way to separate this.

A BundleListener could then simply listen for bundles having a corresponding header and register IModelProcessorContribution on behalf of the bundle. This would also require to later only take one interface into account and even the plugin.xml processing could then be separated into an own extender so the actual ModelAssembler has not to deal with legacy stuff then.

I don't think it would make the life easier if we have several places were the application model is build up. And it would probably result in duplicated code. I don't think we can get rid of the extension point legacy in the ModelAssembler in short.

I have a partially working state with dynamic support. Some cleanup and I can update this patch to discuss. But there is one issue related to fragment loading, lifecycle and equinox bundle activation.

Equinox has the policy to only start a bundle if classes from the bundle are accessed. For fragment contributions the activation happened because the plugin.xml was loaded in INSTALLED or RESOLVED state (not sure about the extension point details). But anyhow it is not related to the STARTED state. So we need to load the fragment when a bundle is installed, and then consistently can only unload on uninstall. Doing it on start/stop will break the concepts in Equinox, as nobody would start a bundle that contributes a fragment, as without the fragment loading, nobody loads the classes from that bundle.

Any thoughts?

@Tom
What do I need to consider when introducing dynamics to not break the non-OSGi use cases? I remember the Logger discussion. But is there anything else?

The same should happen if the DS is contributed in a bundle with lazy Activation policy.

> So we need to load the fragment when a bundle is installed, and then consistently can only unload on uninstall.

Yes that is correct, but has nothing to do specifically with equinox per se. In any standard framework a bundle in resolved state is usable and has a classloader, "ACTIVE" or "Started" just means the BundleActivator has run (if any) and the bundle is contributing. If one of the classes are actually loaded, the bundle gets active by default if it has lazy activation policy.

Resources on the other hand can be loaded without any problem, so if the xmi actually does not define any classes to be loaded even a "resolved" bundle can participate. I just think that "INSTALLED" should be ignored as it means the bundle has no usable class-loader and only bundle local resources can be accessed.

> Doing it on start/stop will break the concepts in Equinox, as nobody would start a bundle that contributes a fragment, as without the fragment loading, nobody loads the classes from that bundle.

See above, a simply track the RESOLVED, STARTING and STARTED state should do the magic!
