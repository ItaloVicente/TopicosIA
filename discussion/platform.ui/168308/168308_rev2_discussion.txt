@Matthias, can you foresee if this change has any other implications? In fact, I wonder why the implementation was like that... Seems to me that this has some distinct reason, but it doesn't appear to me?

Sorry. No I cannot foresee that.

Do you think you could manage to build a unit test for that? The change without a test doesn't seem reassuring IMO.
Line:1148, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> This should maybe use Objects.equals() ?
Also, can you please comment the choice for how to deal with equality here? What specifically was wrong with elementId? It's supposed to be an id so 2 elements with same id are supposed to be equal...

Line:1148, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> I've written some more details in the bugzilla. The identity check was used because some lines above that's the way the references are checked in getViewReference...
However, as I mentioned in the bugzilla, I am not sure if this is the proper way to handle the references.
The element Ids are not unique, that is what caused my problem. I have a part stack with several MParts of the same type which thus have the same element ID.
Also not sure if a unit test makes sense here, the code itself is more or less trivial. But I cannot say that it has no other negative implications...

I think this is something we need to discuss as I'm not certain it's the desired behavior.
Can you please start a thread about it on the platform-dev mailing-list? I think some e4 experts can help finding the best approach here.
