Thanks for the formal part.

I'm not sure about the change as such. As you mention in the bug, the problem is that you always get a different hash code since ImageData does not provide a meaningful has code. When you compare against the dataProvider, you rely on the ImageDataProvider's hash code. In your test this is safe, as you provide a hashCode() for your custom provider. But how about the other implementations? They don't. So they would rely on identity. For example, I would expect that URLImageDataProvider would consider its url for hash code.
Long story short: Are you really sure that relying on the provider's hash code is safe without having them implementing a meaningful hashCode themselves?

Hi Karsten,
I also thought about the impact of this change. My conclusion is:
- using the ImageDataProvider outside of a ResourceManager the hashCode is not realy of interest. It makes no big different if the hashCode is not implemented on ImageData or ImageDataProvider.
-  using the ImageDataProvider within a ResoureManager it makes a difference only if the instance of the ImageDataProvider is reused in different ImageDescriptors. 
- using the hashCode of ImageDataProvider gives the only chance to reuse Image Resources by using the ImageDataImageDescriptor.

Thanks Stefan for this explanation. Could you phrase this a bit into the commit message, so that if this change is looked up in the history it can be understood without navigating to this Gerrit?
I think this change looks reasonable, thanks for that?
