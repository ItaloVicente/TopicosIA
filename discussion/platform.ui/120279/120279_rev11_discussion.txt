displays.

I can but there's another problem: The view dropdown, the minimize and maximize buttons are currently custom drown and use os-specific colors (grey on windows, black on macOS). If we change to PNGs here we have to agree on one color (I think we prefered grey the last time we talked about this) and also need to replace the custom drawn max and min with PNG (or also use the same grey color to draw them).

+1 for grey. I think we can start with one image if we do the other two in the same release

-1. We should do all three together. Otherwise we have a state where they look different.

A good plan. Matthias, can you update the view image here? Once it looks OK, we can taggle min / max until they are OK and release the Gerrit together.
