Asides from my minor comment, this looks good.
Line:389, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/IWorkbenchPreferenceConstants.java -> Maybe it should read:
@deprecated use org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt.CTabRendering.USE_ROUND_TABS instead?

Well, since they are different preference stores, I'm hesitant to point to the new one since it's used for a different purpose. 
 It implies, where you were using 'this', use 'this instead'.

You have a good point.

Lars, what are your thoughts on this? 

After this is decided, this patch can be merged finally :)

@Mike I agree with your solution. We don't want anyone using this preference key anyhow as it should be overriden with CSS if anyone wants to modify it externally.

I'll verify your patch and then merge :)

Actually Mike, it might be worth leaving a note to use CSS if someone wants to modify/override this preference.

Something like:

@deprecated No longer in use. Use swt-corner-radius CSS property to override when round or square corners are desired.

Works as expected :) Once the note about using CSS to override the preference is added, this will be merged.
