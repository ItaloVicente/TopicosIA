I basically tried to follow the same pattern that the StackRenderer does.  I ensured that the listeners in CTabRendering are bound to the disposal of the CTabFolder widget.

You may notice that I removed some redundant null checks in the ViewsPreferencePage since there's already an established pattern that does not have null checks on checkbox buttons.  I suppose these could be moved into a new patch if anyone has any serious objections to the cleanup.

Line:1327, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/CTabRendering.java -> Didn't the corner radius in px used to be 16? If it's currently 14 then this is ok.

Line:1332, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/workbench/renderers/swt/CTabRendering.java -> This is more a personal style preference, but here I'd change it to:

if (USE_ROUND_TABS.equals(event.getKey())) {
	cornerRadiusPreferenceChanged();
}

Keeping it the way it currently is, is fine however :P

Line:45, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/dialogs/ViewsPreferencePage.java -> Moving the preference constant to CTabRendering seems cleaner to me (and we're already importing org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench.renderers.swt.StackRenderer) but Lars would probably know best if this is ok.

I think the corner radius used to be 16, I never noticed it getting switched to 14.  I can fix that up in the morning.

Yeah, I always lean towards an early out.  I always want to know when I can leave a function as soon as possible, certainly in listeners.  Anyways it's a style that we use heavily at Crank.

Okay sounds good.

I tend to use this style often too :) I'm not against it. My proposed alternative only saves one line of code, which is not a good enough argument to require changing what you wrote.

Also I looked into what software Crank makes yesterday, really cool stuff :D

Just tested out the actual patch - it works as expected :D

After the swt-corner-radius is changed back to 16, this will get my +1.

Fine for me. Once you got your commit rights, please feel free to merge Mikes patches after review. You are already way deeper into this topic than me.
