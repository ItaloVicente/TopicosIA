@Vladimir I still do not see the explicit test of added code. You introduced a condition for delta processing - and the test doesn't call it directly. For example, adding a marker will produce IResourceDelta.ADDED that should pass your condition. But it should not, right?

Well, for the test to call it directly, the added method would need to be public, would not it? Are we really talking about exposing a method that is inherently an implementation detail? Is this approach used widely enough in the Eclipse Platform code to consider it a recommended practice?

> For example, adding a marker will produce IResourceDelta.ADDED

No, adding a marker never produces IResourceDelta.ADDED, as one might learn by simply using a debugger.

The new test method `test559539()` explicitly adds, updates, and removes markers. If the condition didn't work correctly, the test would fail. The existing test method `testWorkspaceUndoMonitor()` contains all sorts of other resource modifications. If the condition didn't work correctly, the test would fail. In the end, we have a test that fails on the current master branch and succeeds with the patch applied. What else would be required?

And what if there were no errors to begin with? :-)

It is not a matter of functional style. It is all about control structure. For example, using the visitor, you need to catch a CoreException that actually never occurs. You need an additional condition to skip siblings in case the traversal has already stopped. It just does not seem to fit well to this specific case. Perhaps it is a matter of preference, but I maintain that the original patch set 1 was better structured overall than the current patch set 2. Actually, I would just merge it :-P

In the end, I really wanted to help with this bug, but I'm afraid I have already spent my very limited time budget for working on this. It would be great if someone else could take up the baton. Thank you.

There is a difference between "public" and "API". You can add public type to internal package to improve test coverage, I do not see a problem with it.

You are right, typically it produces the chain of IResourceDelta.CHANGED, but statement "never" that is based on debugger experience is too strong. There is a lot of products that interacts with platform via API and we should cover all the cases that is legal with the public API usage

This is good addition to integration tests - but I'm talking about unit tests. The unit tests should directly interact with the code of "visitor" to ensure it works as expected for the delta it visits.

It depends on the usage, as this place is very sensitive I would expect the reuse of recommended platform code

Part of that is the overhead of anomymous class usage. Actually I'm not a big fan of this API - my arguments are all about "unchanged is more stable than improved", and it makes sense if we are talking about critical IDE points.

Thank you for your time. Maybe we can return to this later.
Line:145, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/undo/WorkspaceUndoMonitor.java -> IResourceDeltaVisitor anonymous implementation instance will be created for each method invocation. I suggest to extract it to the separate type and cover with unit test explicitly, integration test is not sufficient.

Just a note that I regret providing patch set 2, since, in my view as the author of the contribution, patch set 1 is better with regard to code quality and is already adequately tested. While I respect committer powers used to fail the code review, which happens quite often and is not something extraordinary, I nevertheless do not support the raised concerns. I plan no further work on this bug, sorry.

I try to have a look next week Vladimir to provide a second opinion

@Vladimir please don't take it personal. As I stated before, this part of code is too sensitive to be changed with concerns, because it is related with undo and potential data loss. Even if it will be merged by someone - there is a chance it will be reverted later in the release cycle. I already menitioned in the bug that it will be more natural to fix it in LSP4E who attacks the undo queue (according to your report).

Alexander, I do not take it personally at all, I just cannot concur with your points professionally and unfortunately have very little spare time to continue arguing my position, especially when it seems like I'm not going to be heard. That's all there is to it. I'm sorry if I inadvertently made it look like I'm offended by you or something like this, despite my best efforts to choose words. Please do not take it personally either.

Thanks you for keeping the quality of discussion.

Let me describe my position again and this is my subjective opinion:
 - the particular bundle/type/method does matter, i.e. your contribution would be OK for some leaf functionality, but for method that every platform user will invoke it requires much more conservative evaluation
 - the recursive method from PS 1 in this place looks potentially dangerous for me - this is why asked to use standard approach with visitor. I'm not a fan of visitor and the API looks ancient - but it is stable for years.
 - the integration tests are good but insufficient, because they do not test the logic of change explicitly. We need to add explicit unit test to ensure that it works as expected for all the logic branches we have, not just for the particular case.

We are happy with every contribution, but it should be suitable for its place. Again, this particular functionality is too sensitive to just accept the contribution. 
Also, you need to be ready to support your contribution, i.e. to follow up if some bug will be caused by it in the downstream products. So, it is not a "single time activity" to upload a patch, we have a lot of Gerrits with 10+ PatchSets and with a long discussion threads. This is the price to keep the platform stable.

BTW, your not regarding "spare time" was nice, I wonder how it looks from your perspective. My be a big open space with well-funded full-time reviewers that have mostly nothing to do until one uploads a Gerrit? :)

Alexander, I appreciate the time you spent for reiterating your position, and since you asked...

I know what contributing to the Platform might entail, see for example https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=543609, which cost me days of my life.

This bug cost me about a day or two already, and it is counting while I'm writing these words. Consider that fixing (or not fixing) this bug does not affect me or my employer directly; there is a workaround in place already. It is just that Lars asked me to provide a patch, and here I am, willing to help.

Please also consider that I'm just a contributor, and cannot make any commitments beyond just providing a patch. To reiterate, I'm a contributor, not a Platform committer, and I'm not willing to become one. And it is you that keep asking me doing more work and spend more and more time, not the other way around ;-)

Regarding working at the Platform level vs a leaf project. Yes, I understand that concern. That's why I try to keep the size of a patch set to a minimum and never expose anything until it is really required, even in internal packages, which are often exported. And yes, I understand the difference between "public" and "API", of course.

Regarding the patch code itself.

1. I cannot understand why you keep insisting on the resource delta visitor approach. To me, it is clear that the recursive implementation in PS1 just fits the problem at hand better. Having written more than one resource delta visitor in my life, I do not get the argument that one Platform API (IResourceDelta#accept) is more "standard" or "better" than the other (IResourceDelta#getAffectedChildren). They both address the same problem (resource delta tree traversal) from slightly different angles.

To reiterate: I'm not going to reimplement it using a visitor; I see absolutely no value in it. I provided PS2 just so you could see the difference for yourself. Unfortunately, it failed to persuade you. I regret doing that.

2. There is already a test method for WorkspaceUndoMonitor in the Platform: WorkspaceOperationsTests#testWorkspaceUndoMonitor(), which covers the code pretty well (~ 70% as reported by EclEmma). PS1 concisely augments #testWorkspaceUndoMonitor() to cover the new code. Launching WorkspaceOperationsTests with EclEmma reports 100% coverage of the new method, WorkspaceUndoMonitor#isAffectedBy(IResourceDelta). That's it. Zero missed instructions. Do you really believe it would be feasible to provide a better coverage with a unit test?

To reiterate: I'm not going to provide more tests, especially unit tests that would require exposing implementation details; I see absolutely no value in it.

Hopefully, I was clear enough.
