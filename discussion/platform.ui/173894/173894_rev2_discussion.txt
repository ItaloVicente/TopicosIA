DESCRIPTION:

Bug 568991 - Fix black headers in forms in system theme

CSS definitions for 'color' and 'text-background-color' had foreground
and background mixed up. Just swapping the values gives on OS X 10.14.6
with the default system "Accent color" set to "Blue" a form header with
black text on dark blue background, which is not easily readable. Use
the lighter #COLOR_TITLE-BACKGRUND-GRADIENT instead. That is the same
color as used by the section headers, though, and thus some distinction
is lost.

Includes version bump for 4.19.

On Linux/Fedora, the colors for form titles and headers were nice enough before the change (it was some light blue on white) so the issue wasn't much reproducible.
Now it's black on white and black on grey, quite sober, less shiny, but still functional and correct. I think it's OK to merge as it fixes a bug and make things more correct, but beware some people will dislike it though.

But isn't that strange? If before with the system theme it was light blue on white, that means
COLOR-TITLE-FOREGROUND was white. That is now set as 'color', so the text should be white? I don't get it...

Sorry, I messed up my themes during testing. The title is now while on blue, as expected.
