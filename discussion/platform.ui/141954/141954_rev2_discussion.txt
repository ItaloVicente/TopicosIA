DESCRIPTION:

Bug 547157 - Fix Show View dialog element ordering

The ViewComparator was incorrectly comparing different strings to
the different sides of the comparison when trying to sort 'General'
first. This resulted in an effectively random sorting based on which
elements the sort algorithm decided to compare (and in which order).

If the 'Other' category is intended to be placed last (which would seem
reasonable), this would be easy to achieve with the same logic, but
I could see nothing suggesting this is the intention other than the one
erroneous line of code.

Thanks Jonathan. I've slightly modified patch to make sure "Other" is last, which was the case before the patch for bug 430988.

That modification looks fine to me. I suspected Other was supposed to go last but couldn't find any evidence to back it up - the change in 430988 is what I was missing. Thanks!
