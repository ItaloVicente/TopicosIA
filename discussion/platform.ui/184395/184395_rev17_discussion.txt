DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575453 - Doublecklick on Marker without File shows configured View

Since "Goto Resource" is disabled for markers without path and double
click on a Marker can not open any Editor:

Only if no File Editor could be opened this patch uses a view which is
configurable per perspective.
If no view is configured the ProjectExplorer is used as default.

Note that the "Goto Resource" context menu is still disabled.

The main question being whether it is worth introducing (and then covering with tests, documenting, maintaining...) the new perspective setting for this use-case.

I would like this feature - it would help me in my daily life. If we can't agree on any hack then it should be this way. However i do not see any existing test for "open marker". So i doubt we need  automated tests for this simple change. documenting OK, for maintaining i do not see real effort.

I think we should merge Patch Set 10 if it's functional. That was by far the best and less intrusive proposal.
Further discussions that have happened do not invalidate that it's the best choice; they bring concerns on other topics, but those are not fundamentally related to this proposal and are issues coming from other place that should lead us to a more complex or lower quality code.
The new flag on the perspective could see as an issue for 3rd party products as well: imagine a product properly defines their "Show with", deals with perspective extensions, and basically introduce another better explorer by default in the perspective. Those 3rd party products would rather expect the 1st "Show In" proposal to be used instead of the hardcoded Project Explorer here.

I do not mind which version - i just want the feature for java perspective - however for patch set 10 i can not offer the work to fix the PDE perspective - which looks highly misconfigured in terms of show-all :-(

@Mickael how about a compromise: we use this patch, but disable any default (or use first show-in as default - i do not care) but configure the perspectives we care about. This way it is *much* easier to configure the target view, instead of *sorting* out misconfigured perspectives. 
We can not assert that every perspective wants the first show-in as default, as we already have PDE as an example that does not want it.
To "earn" this feature any perspective just has to add a single line.

I'm more in the idea that we start by merging Patch Set 10, which contains a good enough solution for the requester (you) and doesn't require new API nor tweaking established extension point nor hardcoding any view.

Starting that way, we basically cannot assert anything about every perspective. And hardcoding is the most restrictive way to assume something.


So, any objection against merging Patch Set 10?
