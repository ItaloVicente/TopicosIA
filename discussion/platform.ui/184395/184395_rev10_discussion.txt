DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575453 - Doublecklick on Marker without File shows PackageExplorer

Since "Goto Resource" is disabled for markers without path and double
click on a Marker can not open any Editor:

Only if no File Editor could be opened this patch uses the first "Show
in" Handler that supports ISetSelectionTarget to select the Resource
(i.e. the Project).
In the Java workbench this defaults to the Java PackageExplorer.
(The ProjectExplorer does support it too.)

Note that the "Goto Resource" context menu is still disabled.

Almost correct, but I used the PDE perspective. I added some screenshots to the bug report.

The patch should work independently on the perspective :-)

It does work. the perspective just define which "Show in.." actions are available and in which order. When you show the context menu of a resource you can see the "Show in.." order. - For PDE it's kinda messy configured. For Git perspective its almost Git only. Thats fine. You may fix the PDE perspective independently (i do not use it).

No, sorry, that the wrong approach. It is not about fixing one perspective only (because you use it), it is a contribution to Eclipse platform, that is used by many people and in many perspectives.

The patch should either do something useful or not do anything. 

Perspectives can be defined in all possible ways, we can't just let Problems view do some weird things on double click only because something is not as the patch expects.

It needs to depend on the perspective:
PackageExplorerPart is Java only. There are people who don't use eclipse for java. We cant force them to open the PackageExplorer.

How about defining an additional interface like IShowInTarget - "IShowInAutoTarget" - which we (by now) only add to the PackageExplorer?

What if the product wants to customize that and open MuchBetterExplorer instead?

One could add a preference like "General -> Handle problems reported for containers in ..." and let the user select the preferred view to handle that.

They need to add MuchBetterExplorer to the perspective anyway. They just need to put its entry in front of PackageExplorer.

A good default is better then 10000 configurations. Almost nobody would go through all configurations.

FWIW, I agree with Jorg here that defaulting to the default explorer/view as usually defined by the perspective for the container is the best choice - and that it's still an improvement over the current state where doubleclick does nothing-; and I agree that people who are unhappy with their perspective settings about default explorer should bring that issue to the provider of the perspective.
Adding preferences for that would also break the concept of a perspective which does already have some responsibility about what's the default "show in".
