DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575453 - Doubleclick on Marker without File shows PackageExplorer

Since "Goto Resource" is disabled for markers without path and double
click on a Marker can not open any Editor:

Only if no File Editor could be opened this patch uses the first "Show
in" Handler that supports IShowResource to select the Resource
(i.e. the Project).
In the Java perspective this will default to the Java PackageExplorer.
(The ProjectExplorer will support it too - for non-Java perspectives)

Note that the "Goto Resource" context menu is still disabled.

Line:15, bundles/org.eclipse.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> This is needed for other bundles to see new API via org.eclipse.ui

Otherwise Oomph/tycho/whoever can happily update navigator bundle but not the workbench bundle, resulting in a runtime error if new API is used

> Can you please post steps to validate the change? Just wonder how to test it.

Lars gave a nice example: "I created plugin a and b and a cycle between them."
then doubleclick the error marker.
Line:15, bundles/org.eclipse.ui/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF -> i do not understand those detail. but i trust you on that.

It seems to duplicate the perspective Show In duty; and it will most likely scale to show the same issue. What if EGit view suddenly adds the IShowResource interface, what if Terminal does it... In the end, the proposal here adds no clear benefit over relying on the Show In action.

what if .. what if somebody introduces and error... of cause its an error. you can never prevent that. If you dislike this kind of interface please make a better suggestion.

Maybe we should just retitle this patch to a differet scope "Double-click on Marker without File opens first 'Show In'", and then what is 1st show in becomes a dedicated (perspective) problem.

Lars and Andrey did not like that. We seek a solution that all of you can live with.

Clients implementing a public API to "annotate" a view can open a resource is not an error. This API will mislead consumers to make something that this particular consumer think is erroneous, so on that aspect, the error is how the consumer assumes and expects a more generic API will be used.

Stick to Show In, do not put focus on package explorer, let people fix their perspective rather than introducing workarounds that duplicate a capability we already have.

I regret I wasn't fast enough to merge one of your 1st patches earlier; we'd have made a good step forward already and would be working on fixing what needs to be fixed anyway (ie not making the Git views first ones in Show In).

i would be fine with that. 
@Andrey, @Lars can you reconsider that approach?

I see several possible paths forward which are technically acceptable (ie not adding APIs that we don't need and that won't scale)
* We integrate patch set 8 (relying on Show In), and fix the Show In order in parallel because it's not best anyway (I also get Git views as top-level which isn't what's best in my perspective)
* We just abandon the idea that double-click is worth the effort, abandon the patch and let people already enjoy 'Show in'

Unrelated to the discussion how to fix: 

@all: please, if you create or review new API, could you please enable API tooling? Current patch has one API error.

With the current patch, in the default Java perspective, two Java projects referring to each other - the History view is opened if I double click on any of the two errors.
