DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575453 - Doublecklick on Marker without File shows PackageExplorer

Since "Goto Resource" is disabled for markers without path and double
click on a Marker can not open any Editor:

Only if no File Editor could be opened this patch uses the first "Show
in" Handler that supports ISetSelectionTarget to select the Resource
(i.e. the Project).
In the Java workbench this defaults to the Java PackageExplorer.
(The ProjectExplorer does support it too.)

Note that the "Goto Resource" context menu is still disabled.

damn. is that sort order of getShowInPartIds somehow random? any idea how we can prefer package explorer?
At least it opens somewhere ;-)

The only thing I can think of would be to add a new preference somethere and default it with "Project Explorer" (Package Explorer is supposed to be replaced by Project Explorer over time).

Turns out showIn used depends on the active Perspective. You probably was in Git Perspective.  The order is given by the order of "showInPart" elements in 
<extension point="org.eclipse.ui.perspectiveExtensions"> in plugin.xml.
I think thats fine! Just use the Java perspective if you want to use PackageExplorer.

@Lars please test again with switching perspectives.

No it was not in the Git perspective, I never use this perspective

Which perspective do you use? Java? Both Package Eplorer and Git Repositories where both open?

I can re-test tomorrow. From memory: Java Perspective, with Project Explorer in left stack, Package Explorer in bottom stack, Git Repository view not open initially, was opened by double-click.
