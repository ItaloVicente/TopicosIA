Looks good to me.  I have had one occasion where I thought this ability could be useful.
Line:67, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/workbench/HandlerActivationTest.java -> My only comment here is that the names are bit confusing.  How about activePerspective, inactivePerspective, activePart, inactivePart?

Looks also good to me. If Jonas can fix naming suggestion in the test from Brian, I suggest to merge it. Also to stay inline with the general intent to convert to JUnit 4, I think the test should be added as JUnit 4 test.
Line:49, tests/org.eclipse.e4.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/tests/workbench/HandlerActivationTest.java -> Can we add this as JUnit 4 test?

Test suite has been updated to JUnit 4, see Bug 474274. Please rebase this change onto master.

Thanks for the comment.
"active" and "inactive" does not really fit, as they get activated and deactivated during the tests (even in different scenarios). The names reflect the structure. I would rather leave them as they are. If you think it is necessary, I can add some docu, though

As far as I can see, you have updated the core suite, not the ui one. I would prefer to merge this first, before sb switches the ui tests to Junit 4, too.
