Thanks for the comments. The error you report now is probably the follow up on the provided fix. Now that it does not fail anymore for the missing EventBroker, the next one missing is the DefaultResourceBundleProvider component, that probably is not ready yet when the E4Application is started.
If you add equinox.ds or auto-start felix.scr it should be working. 

Regarding your question about the copyright header. Well that class existed before as anonymous inner class. I just made it a separate class so an instance can be created via ContextInjectionFactory. That does not mean I created that class, so IMHO it is correct that the original creator is still the copyright holder.

With regards to the else comment, I provided an update.

For the BundleTranslationProvider issue we could make ResourceBundleProvider @Optional so it can come at a later stage via injection. That should fix that startup order issue. But as it is in platform runtime, that would be another patch.

After adding org.eclipse.equinox.ds I stumbled over another issue and opened bug https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=533285

Whatever org.eclipse.equinox.ds does, it should be also detected somehow by PDE to add it. But that's another issue.

Also your suggestion rgd. BundleTranslationProvider is another issue. Could you open a follow-up bug?

What you wanted to achieve by this change does work then.

Well it was the Equinox DS implementation. Since it was replaced by Felix SCR, it is only a wrapper to make some default configurations to align the DS behavior of Felix with the one DS has (keepInstances). And it is used for backwards compatibility for existing launchers that mention org.eclipse.equinox.ds directly. If you look closer in the editor, you will notice that on adding that bundle, the start level is set to 1 and the autostart flag is set to true for that bundle. The reason is that we need DS on startup in an early stage to make things work. This is not true for org.apache.felix.scr which has the default flags.

That is actually the reason why adding org.eclipse.equinox.ds directly works. It also works if you configure org.apache.felix.scr to autostart in level 1. Then also the BundleTranslationProvider issue does not come up. Not sure if PDE should magically always add equinox.ds as required bundle or if felix.scr should be configured the same way to start automatically in level 1 by the launcher.

Regarding the BundleTranslationProvider, I will create another patch once this is approved. Actually I think it is the same ticket, but another patch as it is in the runtime project.

I'm waiting at least for Andrey who reported the issue and Tom who might be affected by this.

I'm pretty sure you meant Tom Schindl.  But I went ahead and did a review.  Overall the fix seems ok to me.  I have a few questions, but nothing serious and depending on your answers maybe no change required.

I'm a bit concerned about the service registration with no explicit unregistration.  But if an application context being destroyed always results in the OSGi framework being stopped then it maybe OK.  But I do worry if a scenario comes up where the framework instance outlives the application context.
Line:40, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/HostedElementEventHandler.java -> The event is ignored if the uiSync is not set. Is that a problem in practice? Will the uiSync always have been injected before any of these events that get handled by this code get fired?

Line:41, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.workbench/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/internal/workbench/HostedElementEventHandler.java -> Likely a dumb question, but is it possible with e4 DI for the uiSync to get "uninjected" and set to null dynamically here? If so then there is a very small window that will cause an NPE between the check for null and the usage of uiSync.

Yes I meant Tom Schindl. :)
But your feedback is aswell always welcome and appreciated!

AFAIK if the application context is destroyed the whole E4 application will not work anymore. I am not aware of any scenario where the framework would outlive the application context. But maybe I miss some use case. One place where Tom Schindl share his opinion as he knows that place very well.

Regarding the UISynchronize questions, well in DS speaking I would say UISynchronize is a mandatory reference. I just marked it as @Optional because of a time restriction. The ModelServiceImpl instance is created on creating the Application Context. And once created the UISynchronize is added to the Application Context. So the listener is created before the UISynchronize. In theory it could of course happen that someon removes it from the application context. But if he does that, the whole application would not work anymore. The EventBrokerFactory shares the same design. So if someone removes UISynchronize from the application context, actually nothing will work anymore.
From my understanding the proposed patch does not make anything worse as before. If we want to solve that and make the dependenies correct (mandatory) we need to change the way the application context is created. Not sure what side effects would be involved than.
Compared with DS we do not have some orchestration that creates instances via DI once its mandatory dependencies are resolvable. For this scenario it would be the best. If we make UISynchronize available as component, we could register the EventHandler via DS and it gets activated once UISynchronize is available. But I am unsure about side effects aswell.
