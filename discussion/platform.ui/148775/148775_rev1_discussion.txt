Sorry, I have been inactive.

I see no problems with this change. It certainly improves the situation.

I took so long time to get back about this because I tried to figure out if the change solves *all* problems. I'm still not sure about this, but I think we should merge this change anyway.

I have some questions about the changes to TheadRealm, however.

There are still races in the code, in case that the observables are disposed on threads that does not belong to the observables realms. I don't know if this is allowed; there isn't much of a spec of these things.

Kudos to Conrad for managing to create a test for such a tricky case!
Line:239, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/ValueBinding.java -> Is there also a race here? Could the binding and validationStatusObservable become disposed before that value is set?

File Comment: tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/observable/ThreadRealm.java -> Are these changes necessary for the new tests? Otherwise it should go in its own commit.
Line:98, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/observable/ThreadRealm.java -> What is this call for?

If the queue is not empty then the `block` method should be running already? And if an element is added to the queue then notifyAll is called from that method?

Do I miss some case?

Line:138, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/observable/ThreadRealm.java -> Is it necessary to have an additional loop for spurious wake-ups? Doesn't the outer loop take care of those?

Line:138, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/observable/ThreadRealm.java -> Disregard this comment! There is no additional loop! I was confused in some way...

Line:138, tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/tests/databinding/observable/ThreadRealm.java -> But anyway, is the extra check with `doProcess` necessary?

The general pattern for handling spurious wake-ups is that when a thread wakes up it should check the condition it is waiting for.

It seems to me that the code already checks its condition. The condition in this case is whether there are any elements in the queue, and whether `block` is still true.

It seems to me like this is sufficient and that there is no need to also use `doProcess`.
