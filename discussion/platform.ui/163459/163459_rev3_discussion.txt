I'm a bit torn on whether or not the tab highlight should be on the top or bottom.

Having it on top seems a bit more common (Firefox does this) however as you mentioned to me a while back, IJ uses the bottom (with certain themes).

Realistically... it might be better to just go with your proposal of having it on the bottom and then get feedback from the community.

A followup bug to allow customizing the active tab highlight preferences would be nice too (let the user select the color of the highlight and maybe set whether it should be on the top or bottom). Just writing this so I don't forget after this is merged ;)
Line:48, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_tabstyle.css -> Maybe we should enable the selected tab highlight for form editor tabs? IMO they would benefit from this as it's pretty hard to tell which form editor tab is active on the dark theme.

Line:63, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_tabstyle.css -> Originally I was going to suggest the default selection color on GTK (#3584e4) however, this would only really help keep colors consistent on GTK.

The color you used is nice as it's kind of faded so it goes good with the grey used for the tab colors.

Line:64, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_tabstyle.css -> This is nitpicking but could you replace the 4 spaces used with a tab? :P

Line:64, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.themes/css/dark/e4-dark_tabstyle.css -> The file prior to my changes mostly seemed to use 4 spaces (with one tab and one 2 space indent), so I've switched all added lines to 4 spaces instead.
