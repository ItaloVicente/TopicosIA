Thanks for the review! I'm updated a few bits.

Agreed regarding the follow up colour preference.

The disadvantage is that it adds complexity, we've already got quite a few colour definitions in the default themes, and sometimes these can cause confusion (see Bug 559312 for example).

The advantage is that users can choose their own favourite colour and can effectively disable the highlighter by setting it to the same colour as the tab background. I can then avoid a revolution when some unhappy users will without doubt come and complain about this new feature. :)

Agreed, it will add complexity. I've discussed this with Aleksander Kurtakov and we're both in favour of trying to implement a way for users to paste in CSS to modify the currently used theme. This could provide much deeper theme customization without adding extra font & color preferences. A new bug should be made for this.

Exactly :) 

This looks good to me, merging. Great work Pierre-Yves!
