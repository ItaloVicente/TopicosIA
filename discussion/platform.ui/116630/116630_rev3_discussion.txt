DESCRIPTION:

Bug 530628 - PartActivationHistory and EPartService.ACTIVE_ON_CLOSE_TAG

EPartService.ACTIVE_ON_CLOSE_TAG is not always honored by
PartActivationHistory.

getActivationCandidate(MPerspective) requires that a part candidate is
contained in the perspective.  This is usually the case unless one drags
the part into a detached window or into stickyFolderRight...

When the application is closed with the active part outside the
perspective, then that part is not restored as the active part.

This matters very little in the Eclipse IDE, but may be important for
certain applications.

In this proposal, any part from the EPartService that contains
EPartService.ACTIVE_ON_CLOSE_TAG is returned regardless whether it is
contained in the perspective.

Something like SessionCreateTest and SessionRestoreTest from org.eclipse.ui.tests.api?

Whatever works ;) I admit I don't have much knowledge nor preference about what those tests could be best. So if SessionRestoreTest seem good for you to mimic here, feel free to get inspired.
What matters is that the test 1. reproduce the initial bug as close a possible from description 2. fails without the patch and 3. passes with the patch.
