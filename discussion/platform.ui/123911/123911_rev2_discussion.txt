DESCRIPTION:

Bug 535462 - NPE when closing second window during debug

The bug occurs while debugging, having two windows and a custom debug
context provider. When closing the second window,
DebugWindowContextService.notify is called with the selection of the
custom debug context provider. If this selection is e.g. a stack frame,
SourceLookupService asks SourceLookupFacility to open a source file.
This throws a NPE, since the workbench page window is closing.

With this change, WorkbenchPage.openEditor will not try to open an
editor if the page window is closing. Instead, it will log a warning and
return null.

Reproduction is relatively complicated, but it should be possible to write a test. Do we want one?

If this patch is not want we want, we can also expose WorkbenchWindow.isClosing() (its protected at the moment) and ask for this during SourceLookupFacility.openEditor. SourceLookupFacility.openEditor already asks if the workbench is closing, so it would be OK for it to ask the page window the same.

For this we could either define IWorkbenchWindow.isClosing, or cast in SourceLookupFacility and call internal methods. Unfortunately both requires changes in platform.ui and platform.debug. So this approach seems more valid but the change is more complicated also.

See comment.
Line:3212, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchPage.java -> This violates the contract, null is allowed for external editors.

I would say we should simply throw PartInitException here, no logging etc. However, this will not help ServiceLookupFacility, because how it should know if this PartInitException is one which shouldn't trigger error dialog.

One can pass a IStatus to the exception with some code but this would be a hack.

I think the best way is to add isClosing() *API* to the IWorkbenchWindow and use this from debugger.

See org.eclipse.ui.IWorkbench.isClosing().
