DESCRIPTION:

Bug 535462 - NPE when closing second window during debug

The bug occurs while debugging, having two windows and a custom debug
context provider. When closing the second window,
DebugWindowContextService.notify is called with the selection of the
custom debug context provider. If this selection is e.g. a stack frame,
SourceLookupService asks SourceLookupFacility to open a source file.
This throws a NPE, since the workbench page window is closing.

With this change, WorkbenchWindow.isClosing is exposed as API of
IWorkbenchWindow, so that SourceLookupFacility can check for this and
avoid opening a source while the window is closing.

OK, looks good, API tools do not complain too.

I'm not +2 on this because we still have no 4.9 builds running.

As soon as we will have them (in a week or two, may be after 4.8 release is shipped, I have no idea right now ?), I will merge this.

Please prepare the follow-up patch for debug ui, (it will not compile, but this is not a problem now).

Once more, commit message should be updated.
Line:14, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think this does not belong to this commit, but to the debug ui commit.

Please change the commit message, pointing to the API change first.
