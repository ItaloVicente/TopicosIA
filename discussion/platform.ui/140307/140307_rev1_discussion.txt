I believe I can't reproduce it anymore with this patch, however I've only seen the error twice before. Would be nice if you could verify it works.

I've tested it on RHEL 7.4 Linux, it seem to fix the issue, I see no side effects so far.

This avoids the error but the previous choices are lost.

Can it be that the previous change caused this? This one shouldn't affect retrieval at all, only avoiding AnPE

Yes, I think so. It works fine in 4.11.

Patch Set 1:

This could probably be automatically tested by instantiating one SearchField (DI make it much harder than it could be...) selecting a dummy command of whatever so it get stored, disposing the SearchField and reinstantiating a new one and checking the default proposals.

And, in general, this whole SearchField class is a bit messy and fragile because it does too much, so it would probably need some heavy refactoring to be reliable.

It's actually a lot of work to get it behaving well with such code and without a decent functional coverage with automated tests...

Test would be good. But note that it did work in 4.11.

I'm fine to merge this NPE fix but we should find a correct fix for M1 as well since it got broken in M1.
