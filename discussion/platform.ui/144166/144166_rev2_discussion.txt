I did not look at the code but at some point we should generify the JFace viewer API. Does that change restrict us?

Actually it was inspired by "fix raw type warnings" activity. Maybe we just need to suppress signature warnings and start "jface.viewers.typed" effort instead?

We tried once, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=402445 but failed due to concerns from the community. If you want to start another attempt that would be awesome. jens@lidestrom.se should be a great reviewer, as he did the databinding generic work.

OK, but this may be an epic activity. Most probably it will be another generation of viewers in the separate package(s).

What should we do with this gerrit change and bugzilla record?
