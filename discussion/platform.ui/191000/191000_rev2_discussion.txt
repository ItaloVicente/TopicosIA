DESCRIPTION:

Bug 578864 - remove fake job from waiting progress list

The change removes an entry for the swt display thread
"The user is waiting for background work to complete"
if no particular Job was running in display thread.

Since it is now possible to cancel exactly that job
with a dedicated cancel button the additional entry 
for does not add value but is confusing.
