DESCRIPTION:

Bug 466511: Make view menu icon crisp on HiDpi displays

Instead of replacing the custom drawn icon with a PNG simply make the
drawing HiDPI aware.

Also: Made the drawing code more understandable by replacing magic
numbers with meaningful names.

What was the issue with using png files instead that they needed a bit more work? I personally would like to see this special case remove from our code base.

wenn we remove this code, we have to adapt also the max and min. icons because they use os-specific colors for the lines. And they should be consident. 

And to be honest I have enough of all these discussions about colors and pixel-differences. And this was the easiest way to get rid of the blurry triangle that is visible everwhere.

Why do you personally like to get this special case removed? Where does it hurt?

The custom drawn icons look IMHO bad, especially on Linux. And I would like to see a consistent usage of PNG files. This would for example make it easier in the future to replace them via CSS (if we implement this in the CSS engine).

I understand your frustration with "this pixel look different" but I believe you also get this feedback if you adjust the gc code. ;-)
