Lars, for non trivial patches please create bugs.
This is a non trivial patch, and I fear the diagnostic is broken too.
Line:389, bundles/org.eclipse.jface/src/org/eclipse/jface/resource/CompositeImageDescriptor.java -> Not sure why should it be good. The if above is ignored then, so instead of return imageData on next iteration we would proceed further with the code after the loop.

Fabrice, please have a look. This is an example for a wrong result of the "Exit loop early" JDT cleanup.

Once Fabrice had a chance to look at this and confirms it is an issue worth looking into, I can create one.

Things would work better the other way round IMO.

I think it is preferable not to tell contributes how to work. I did the work to test this cleanup in my unpaid time, so I think I should be allowed to ask Fabrice for his opinion before opening a bug.

I would love to see others to also help testing JDT cleanups instead of instructing me how to work.

Well, you don't need to test & report anything, but *if* you do this and see that the tool is broken, shouldn't you be interested to fix the tool *before* pushing other cleanups created with the broken tool?

Yes, I typically stop using a certain cleanup once I find an issue with it and be very careful with reviewing existing ones.

I confirm it's a bug in the cleanup and a ticket must be created.

It's a pity. There are workflow that work better than others for the project (eg reporting a bug when one see a bug), there is indeed no way to mandate contributors to work one way or the other, but as a contributor, rejecting the idea of using better workflows is reducing the value/productivity such contributor is producing for the project.
