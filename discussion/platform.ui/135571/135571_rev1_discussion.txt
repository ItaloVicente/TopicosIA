DESCRIPTION:

Bug 542982 - Adding an underscore to existing workspace in workspace
location dialog doesn't work

The proposal update was triggered by the VerifyListener.
Since this listener is called before the text changes have been applied,
the proposals didn't always match the text content.

Some part of the problem is solved and other part is not solved.

Problem 1:
Launch eclipse in workspace C:\workspace1
File -> Switch Workspace-> Others  ( same workspace is selected)
Add an underscore and press enter.

Problem 2
Launch eclipse in workspace C:\workspace1
Close eclipes
Launch eclipse in workspace C:\workspace1_
File -> Switch Workspace-> Others  ( same workspace above is selected)
Remove the underscore and press enter


With this patch, problem 1 is fixed but problem 2 still exist. Both these problems didnt exist in eclipse-SDK-I20181114-1345-win32-x86_64

Problem 1 is more common scenario and is broken since early December
Problem 2 is also a recent regression but I am not sure if both of them started together but at separate times.
