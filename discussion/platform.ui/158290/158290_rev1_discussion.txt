DESCRIPTION:

Bug 553483 - ViewerDropAdapter does not reset lastValidOperation

In clearState() the lastValidOperation and overrideOperation is reset.
Furthermore in dragEnter() clearState() is called on entry (this could
also be moved to client code, see comment code).
The faulty scenario to consider is: a drag source, that does only
support DROP_COPY and a drop target, that accepts DROP_MOVE and
DROP_COPY. If then the first D&D was a DROP_COPY, the second one (from
the same 'copy-only' source) would be treated (and accepted) as
DROP_COPY, even if it was DROP_NONE, because the DROP_COPY is
(non-erasable) stored in lastValidOperation (=> surprising behavior for
clients...).

@Gerhard the comment implies that the scenario needs some prerequisites. Is it possible to add a test to demonstrate the fix? https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.ui/tree/master/tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers

@Alexander: so far I tested manually and I have no test code at hand. I will write and provide a test, but it can take a few days...

This fix can hardly be merged in this release as we are near RC1 already. The changes you did may impact the existing code, so it is better to incorporate them in the beginning of the release cycle - this way we will have time to do more testing.

Alexander, I tried to write a test with 'faked' DropTargetEvent events to demonstrate the bug / fix. But I fail to create DropTargetEvent objects. So real D&D seems to be necessary. IMHO this leads me to SWTBot (I have no experience with SWTBot so far). Would a SWTBot based test acceptable (the other tests seem not to employ SWTBot)?

SWTBot may require too much infrastructure setup. Have you tried to emulate it via DragSource/DropTarget? 
BTW, I don't know what can we name as "real D&D" - it all looks to be "imaginary" :)

What I meant with "real D&D" was an D&D operation initiated by a "real" mouse click :). I had a closer look on DragSource/DropTarget and I could not figure out a way to emulate the drop... I working on Windows where SWT D&D is implemented using Windows COM interfaces, therefore I'm not sure, if SWTBot could help here anyway? Do you have any tip?
I understand that my change might have impact on existing code. Mainly because the call to ckearState() in dragEnter(). This call could be removed and it would be the responsibility of the derived (client) class to call it, if the context makes in necessary (at least my RCP app could live with it). According to the Javadoc of clearState() I would state, that resetting lastValidOperation was simply forgotten (maybe this field was introduced late...)

May be this can help you https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.platform.swt/blob/master/tests/org.eclipse.swt.tests.win32/JUnit%20Tests/org/eclipse/swt/tests/win32/Test_org_eclipse_swt_dnd_DND.java

Yes, exactly, this is why we need to imrove test coverage.

Sorry for the long delay, but I had a busy time. I now have a Junit test that nicely demonstrates the fix. As I'm not aware of all your conventions and machinary, I will send it to you via a separate e-mail and hope that you can put it to the right location...

Thanks for update, Gerhard!
The unit test is important part of patch set, please add it. I suggest to put it here: https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/tree/tests/org.eclipse.jface.tests/src/org/eclipse/jface/tests/viewers
