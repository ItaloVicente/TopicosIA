No, sorry, this one makes really no sense. What is wrong on the "imperative style loop"? Debugging lambdas is a pain, creating them in such number is an overhead at runtime, stack traces are not readable, etc.

Just as a small hint for the background: As far as I know lambdas and streaming are the only simple way to make use of modern multi core cpu and allow to spread load on all cpu cores in java. Every other way is more bloated.
If it is worth the complexity added to debugging would need a careful adoption of the code and measurement of the performance (that can even decrease in a lot of situation as a matter of fact).
But it is fine if that is not something interesting for you at this point. I just wanted to share this...

Lambda's do not mean more cores will run faster a single threading computation (how it schould be done?!), it means first that *more* computing power is needed to run exact same code. 

To benefit from more cores you need *parallel* execution - which is unrelated to converting the code to lambdas.

If you want improve performance, check bugzilla for bugs with "performance" keyword, and try to fix *real* problems. All the places here are not performance critical, end if, the lambdas would not be the solution anyway.

Hi Andrey,
thanks for sharing this info. However lambda expressions and streams have a lot to do with parallel execution. 
To get an idea have a look at e.g. https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/jamsi.2018.14.issue-1/jamsi-2018-0007/jamsi-2018-0007.pdf
However in the end you might be right to be sceptical because of other implications.
So I don't care. Maybe another day we will see this or a better change.
Best regards,
Carsten
