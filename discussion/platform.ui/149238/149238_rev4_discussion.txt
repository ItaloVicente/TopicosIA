Patch Set 4:

Neither Gerrit nor Eclipse IDE shows me a API baseline error which I find strange, as I'm marking API for deletion.

Adding Andrey as he usually suffers from API baseline errors, in case he want to comment.

If I don't hear anything I plan to merge tomorrow.

Comments are added without respecting existing ones, sometimes with @deprecated, sometimes without, sometimes with annotation added between class comments. This is not nice. 

I haven't checked API build, can check tomorrow.

I figured it is not worth spending time on having nice comments on code which is not used and will be deleted.
