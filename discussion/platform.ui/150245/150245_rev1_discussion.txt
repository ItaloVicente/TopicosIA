Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> most changes are no switch statements, message does not fit

Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/css2/CSSPropertyTextSWTHandler.java -> As we are on it, this looks buggy. newColor might be null here, which will lead to problems later when using newColor for setForeground/setSelectionForeground.

The logic should be here:
  if (newColor == null || newColor.isDisposed()...

This should be done by separate bug. Could you open one and provide a patch, and remove this from the change?

Line:51, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertySelectionBackgroundHandler.java -> the original code does not make toLowerCase(). Why did you add it?

Line:69, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertySelectionBackgroundHandler.java -> This changes the logic. When I see it correctly then the previous logic *always* returned false. Now you return true, even when the property was not handled.

The original logic seems to be broken. IMHO the method should return true when the CSS property was applied, false otherwise.

Unfortunately the contract of the method does not document that and looking at some implementations shows that they always return false.

This looks as a bug to me. If you agree, open one.

Please do not change the original logic with this change, even if it is wrong.

Line:38, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertyTabPositionSWTHandler.java -> typo

Line:42, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.properties.tabbed/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/properties/tabbed/css/TabbedPropertyListCssPropertyHandler.java -> and here no lowerCase? looks inconsistent.

Thanks Karsten for the review.

Benedikt, some background why Karsten gave the feedback: we want to have focused commits so in case we find an issue we can simply revert the focused commit. Focus commits makes also review easier

Benedikt, take a -1 not offensive. As Lars said, changes should be focused on the issue they resolve. I thought that the issues I pointed out are somehow other flaws and should be handled separately. Thanks for your contribution anyway, would be awesome if you could provide the other enhancements also! Thanks!

No problem!
IMHO its always a trade-off between having full traceability and taking the risk of "good" changes not being conducted at all, but I guess you already had a lot of discussions about that topic in the past ;)
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Do you have any suggestions for a better message or should we change the bug title as well?

Line:66, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/css2/CSSPropertyTextSWTHandler.java -> opened Bug 551692

Line:51, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertySelectionBackgroundHandler.java -> Think it is worth a discussion as imho CSS properties should be case insensitive. I see that that this is a change in logic and should be handled in a separate bug so I am going to revert it.

Line:69, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertySelectionBackgroundHandler.java -> Opened Bug 551693 - will change logic back to always return false.

Line:38, bundles/org.eclipse.e4.ui.css.swt/src/org/eclipse/e4/ui/css/swt/properties/custom/CSSPropertyTabPositionSWTHandler.java -> Done

Line:42, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.views.properties.tabbed/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/properties/tabbed/css/TabbedPropertyListCssPropertyHandler.java -> The property constants are not lowercase here, so I decided to keep it case sensitive...
This probably should be handled in a separate bug as well.

This is the bug title, so do you want to have the bug title changed or the commit message or both?

I don't have the priviledges to change the bug title myself...
