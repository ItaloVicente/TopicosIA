DESCRIPTION:

Bug 525387 - Cannot hide inactive view with its reference

This is a test case for the bug. The test opens a perspective with two
views, both in the same folder. It then retrieves a reference to the
inactive view, and tries to hide the view using this reference. The test
fails, since it doesn't receive a view hide notification. It can also
still retrieve a reference to the view.

test still not running.
Please try `mvn clean verify -Pbuild-individual-bundles` locally from the Git repo root or from the org.eclipse.ui.tests/ folder. Then, upon completion, look inside org.eclipse.ui.tests/target/surefire-reports to find whether there is a report file about your new HiveViewInNewPerspectiveTest. The goal is that such file gets generate and report a test failure (or even to mark the build as failed because of this test)

Abandoned

The -1 Code Review has been pending for more than a year without any reaction to resolve it. That's a sign this got actually abandoned.
Please reopen if you're still willing to work on this patch.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> The test would fail though, what is the point?

Presuming I figure out how to add it to the automatic tests (which was "the issue" so far, other than having no fix).
