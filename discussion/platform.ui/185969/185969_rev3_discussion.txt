DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576350 - Add cancel user operation button to blocking dialog

This change adds a cancel button to the "User Operation Waiting"
blocking dialog, allowing the user to cancel their blocked operation in
order to continue using the Eclipse UI.

Note that the button does not cancel the operations that are blocking
the initial user operation. If the user attempts the same operation, the
blocking dialog will pop-up again (for as long as the blocking
operations are running).

Line:336, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/progress/BlockedJobsDialog.java -> This is the same as patch set 2 in terms of functionality, but we rely on the cancel button id resulting in a cancelPressed() call. IMO this is better than patch set 2.

Wouldn't it be nicer if the blocking operation would be canceled? In your screencast the build process should be canceled and my work should be saved.

So far I'm not aware of plans from Advantest to contribute something for bug 518665.

From my POV, finding out which job holds whatever lock is preventing the user operation will not be trivial. A button like that would of course be nice, but I don't know if the effort is worth the result.

No plans, also see below.

Not only that. 

1) There can be N jobs waiting on the lock, typically they all will try to acquire the lock immediately after current one that blocks will finish. So killing one will not help, the dialog will appear immediately again. In contrast, there is only one "user operation" waiting, because we only have one UI thread, so if cancelled, the user could re-think if he should repeat whatever action caused the UI to "hang".

2) Additionally, typical "user" jobs can be cancelled because user can re-trigger them again. E.g. saving an editor while some longer workspace locking task is running will be cancelled, and can be re-triggered once the lock goes away. On the other side, the jobs that are *blocking* are typically some long running operations, which either do not support cancellation at all, or may cause another long waiting time to redo whatever the would fail to finish.
