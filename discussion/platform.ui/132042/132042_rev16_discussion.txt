DESCRIPTION:

Bug 544821 - Cache result of ModelServiceImpl#find

Added CacheAdapter, which was copied from Eclipse Xtext. Xtext
uses this cache which is attached as an adapter to an EResource and
evicts itself when any change happens to the contained EObjects.
Added version constraint on org.eclipse.emf.ecore since new method
EContentAdapter#useRecursion is used.

Added new test ModelServiceImplTest.

> The method should be hit often enough during a workbench startup. I would enable trace mode in YourKit to see how often it is called and the consumed time for that. I'll provide data to the bug.

I have attached profiling results to the bug. It seems that there is not enough to gain ATM. Shall we abandon this?
