I discovered a problem in DataBindingContext.dispose.

I also though more about the changes where a copy operation of a collection is removed by this change. I think those copy operations should be preserved to avoid changing any behaviour. Removing the copies might result in subtle bugs, as the example in DataBindingContext.dispose shows.

This applies to this Gerrit, but also to the others. I think there was a removed copy operation in the JFace change also, for example.
Line:232, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/databinding/identity/IdentityMap.java -> I think the copy should be preserved to avoid changing any behaviour.

Line:165, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/databinding/identity/IdentityObservableSet.java -> I think the copy should be preserved to avoid changing any behaviour.

Line:140, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/databinding/identity/IdentitySet.java -> I think the copy should be preserved to avoid changing any behaviour.

Line:369, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/databinding/DataBindingContext.java -> Here is a change in behaviour that probably introduces a bug.  

Binding.dispose calls DataBindingContext.remove, which modifies the bindings collection. This probably lead to a ConcurrentModificationException. There should be a unit test for this; apparently there is not.

To avoid this problem the bindings and validationStatusProviders lists must still be copied after this change.

When I've got think about this a little more, I really think all copy operations in other places should also be preserved.

File Comment: bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/databinding/IdentityMap.java -> Removing this class is an unrelated change.

It's good to remove this class if it isn't used, but that has  to be done in a separate change.

(Why does this class exist if it isn't used? Probably because it was copied together with other classes from org.eclipse.core.internal.databinding.identity, even if it wasn't needed.)

Thats interesting. Would it be possible to solve this issue by using one of the concurrent collections or List<Object> objList = Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<Object>()); after entering the method?
Or maybe the datatype to have as parameter in the method should rather be https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CopyOnWriteArrayList.html?

CopyOnWriteArrayList allow modifications while they are iterated and I think that would solve the issue; Collections.synchronizedList doesn't change how the  ArrayList works in this regard.

But regardless of alternative solutions I think it's best to make this change big but "dumb": Modify a lot of files but make simple modifications.

A separate change could be created to get rid of copy operations, in cases where that is important.
