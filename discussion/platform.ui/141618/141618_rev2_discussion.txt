> Jens, please review

I'm happy to help with the review process. But I have to prepare you on the fact that I really don't know when I will have time and energy to spend on it.

I'll try to do this some evening during this week or in the weekend, but it could also be the case that I do it the week after that.

These changes look like good improvements, but they are also not urgent. If a change look urgent I'll try to do it promptly, or at least replay to say I don't have time at the moment.
Line:238, bundles/org.eclipse.core.databinding.observable/src/org/eclipse/core/internal/databinding/identity/IdentityMap.java -> I think toReatin1 is not a good name.

I think it's more clear to use a name like `e` when the scope is so small.

Okay, I did the whole review right now. (I really shouldn't have!)
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Use for-each loop in databinding

@Carsten Hammer:

I see a few style issues with the patches that are repeating, both in one and the others. I think you should fix them in all of the patches before other reviewers look at them.

* Many loop variables have poor names. Look through them and update them to something better.

Example: Rename `retainAll1` to `elem` or `e` or `toRetainElem`.

* There is new indentation that uses spaces instead of tabs. It should be all tabs.

* Minor thing: The languages construct is called the "for-each loop". It's better to use this term in the commit message.

Thanks Jens for the feedback. In case you are not available for a review that is fine, reviewing is an optional activity but I wanted to make you aware of these changes in databinding as you working on it.

In case you are to busy or do not have the energy for a code review, simply remove yourself as reviewer or leave a short comment so that we can find another reviewer.
