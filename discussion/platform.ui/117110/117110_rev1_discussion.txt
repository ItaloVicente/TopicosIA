DESCRIPTION:

Bug 371586 - various smaller code fixes in Markers area

- Add toString() to MarkerCategory and MarkerField
- Use Linked* collections for stable iteration behavior
- faster compare in MarkerComparator
- mark fields accessed from different threads volatile
- trying to avoid concurrent access to markerEntryArray:
Markers.getClone() should return cloned arrays

Note: getClone() implementation and its usage overall in the code is MT broken by design. It tries to return new instance with same markerEntryArray object if it is not "inChange" yet. However no one prevents the change of a "clone" AFTER the array reference was returned, and no one guarantees the atomicity of the isInChange/markerEntryArray states.

looks okay, just some style issues
Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> you may want to reformat this long line

Line:193, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/markers/MarkerCategory.java -> PMD/Sonarqube: Avoid concatenating characters as strings in StringBuffer.append

Line:265, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/MarkerField.java -> same here

Line:245, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/internal/MarkerGroup.java -> I think this can be simplified further to 

    findGroupValue(item2.getMarker())

Line:16, /COMMIT_MSG -> Interesting, this one line was formatted like this by egit, even if "hard wrap commit message" is enabled. Must be a bug.
It looks like the "Note:" on the beginning causing this. OMFG, it thinks "Note:" is some special attribute like "Bug:"

What is even more interesting: Gerrit accepted this commit without message id and signed off attributes, or may be it fails to show them after the unexpected "Note:" line.

Line:193, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/views/markers/MarkerCategory.java -> One of the most annoying and idiotic Sonarqube warnings. For debug code, such warnings are irrelevant and should be reported as false positive. I will change it but if you run Sonarcube, please report this as a bug.

Line:265, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/MarkerField.java -> same answer

Line:245, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/views/markers/internal/MarkerGroup.java -> No, it can't. The method you mentioning needs ConcreteMarker.
