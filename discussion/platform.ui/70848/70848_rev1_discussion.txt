I'm not myself a user of MRU so I cannot really review this functionality. However, I've put a few comments related to plain code that I believe should be addressed to keep this contribution as simple as possible.
Line:298, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/NavigatorFilterService.java -> This seems like a bug in initial code. Do you know other parts of the navigator that could be fixed thanks to that change?
If so, then we might consider make a seprarate patch for this.

Line:117, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/CustomizationTab.java -> What's the point in extracting this method?

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/SelectFiltersAction.java -> I'm not sure this is necessary: the filterSelectionDialog already takes care of applying changes as part of its okPressed method, so there is no need to check for dialog value at that point.
I'm not saying it's a bad thing to do it, but as it doesn't seem to be a bug nor to be related to the issue you're willing to change, it would be IMO better to not mix concerns and avoid this kind of unrelated change.

Line:52, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/ToggleFilterAction.java -> Same think as earlier: isn't it an unrelated bug fix that could be separated for easier tracking and review?

Line:298, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/NavigatorFilterService.java -> No, I do not know other parts that could be fixed. I needed that fix to make the ToggleFilterAction work.

Line:117, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/CustomizationTab.java -> In the subclass CommenFiltersTab I also needed a ICheckStateListener.

I thought that it would we better to have just one listener registered. So I extracted the checkStateChanged method to be able to override it in the subclass.

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/SelectFiltersAction.java -> I agree that it is not strictly necessary, but when the dialog has been canceled I want to avoid updating the MRU filter list.

Line:298, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/NavigatorFilterService.java -> Ok.

Line:117, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/CustomizationTab.java -> Ok, makes sense.

Line:53, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.navigator/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/navigator/filters/SelectFiltersAction.java -> Makes sense.
