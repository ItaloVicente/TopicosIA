IMO, this is ready to be merged as soon as M1 is released (end of week).

Although it's concise, the commit message is IMO pretty clear and describes well what this change is about. What specific information do you find missing in it?

I pinged this because the commit message was not clear to me. There is no commit body to explain why this change was needed and what has been done to fix it. 

We recently discussed commit messages in this thread.

(It looks like the subject has a spelling error. Although I don't mind spelling errors, it does not help grasping what has been changed for this specific commit.)
