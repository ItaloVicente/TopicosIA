DESCRIPTION:

Bug 479218 - Add projects as resource to select in Open project Dialog

Bugzilla ticket 479218 requested projects to be displayed in the Open
Resource Dialog. This allows for searching, filtering and selecting
projects in a quick and convenient way.

Changes:
OpenResourceHandler.java
- Added IProject as valid resource type for the OpenResourceDialog

FilteredResourcesSelectionDialog.java
- The OpenResourceDialog displays information about the parent of the
displayed resources. Since projects have usually ROOT as parent and
ROOT doesn't contain any useful information for the user, the
implementation for this case was changed to either omit the parent
information or use the selected resource instead.
- Added convenience method parentIsRoot(IResource) to check if resource
parent is of type ROOT.

OpenResourceDialog.java
- When Projects are selected, "Open" and "Open With" would not make
sense. Disabled this buttons for this use case.

Looks great, thanks a lot Dieter for providing this.

One follow-up work would be nice. For example, it would be great if the label provider could add an info that the resource is a project. Currently, if I type aaa a project name it lists aaa but gives no indication that this is a project so it is a bit confusing that the Open With button is inactive. Best would IMHO if the project explorer could register as "editor" for projects but I guess this would be a bigger challenge to implement.

Dieter, if you are interested in working on an improved label provider, let me know and I open a bug for that. But even without this, this is SUPER useful, thanks again.

Isn't the project indicated by the icon?

Yes. But I think a text indication would still be nice. But if you don't think so nor plan to work on this, the current functionality is already great.

ah, ok. I think it is fine for now. I don't see me changing this further.
