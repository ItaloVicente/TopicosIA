Line:542, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/extensions/org/eclipse/ui/dialogs/FilteredResourcesSelectionDialog.java -> since this is always tested with resource.getParent() and IResource.ROOT, shouldn't it be simplified to parentIsRoot(IResource resource) ?

Line:290, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/src/org/eclipse/ui/internal/ide/dialogs/OpenResourceDialog.java -> This condition should be generalized to other forms of containers, and actually be reversed to identify the only different case (ie the case of only files), something like !Arrays.stream(getSelectedItems()).allMatch(IFile.class::isInstance)

Thank you for your review Michael.

Instead of negating the condition in OpenResourceDialog i would rather use it for the else case since this handles the "only files" case.

The other issue i see is that "getSelectedItems()" does not return an Array but an SturcturedSelection. I would have to call "toArray()" or "toList()". Both of wich copy the array. This is probably fine but i think it's not the best solution.
Since we see StructuredSelection as a container shouldn't it provide a "stream()" function?

So in short: should i copy the array or add a stream() function? please let me know

OK.

Looking at toList, the array doesn't seemed copied but is instead wrapped in a list, so I don't think there is a drawback 

> Since we see StructuredSelection as a container shouldn't it provide a "stream()" function?

That would be nice, but it's a bigger piece of work (adding API requires much more attention), so I don't think we should try it as part of this change. Please open a separate bug for this.

> So in short: should i copy the array or add a stream() function? please let me know

I think it's fine to use toList() at the moment.
