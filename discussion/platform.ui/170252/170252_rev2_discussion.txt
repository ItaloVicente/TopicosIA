Thanks Dieter, one smaller comment below. Larger question: Did you try integrating this into the Open Resource dialog? If yes, what prevented you from adding it to this dialog?
Line:1253, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.ide/plugin.xml -> Why not using Ctrl+Shift+P which would be similar to Ctrl+Shift+R for resources and Ctrl+Shift+T for types?

Regarding The Key Binding: The current key binding is the same i used in my plugin "Project Select" and the Plugin i got the idea from "Select Project" (this is no longer installable). I did not change that because i don't know to what. Many good key bindings are already taken. Ctrl+Shift+P for example is already taken by 3 other commands. I don't see that i as a contributor have the authority or the knowhow to switch key bindings around. In short: the key binding is open for debate.

Regarding the integration into the open Resource Dialog: The two dialogs are very different in nature. The only common thing is that they do something with recourses. The differences are:
- One Dialog displays Files, the other Projects.
- The Select Projects Dialog selects Projects in views that allow project selection while Open Resource Dialog opens Files.
- The Open Resources Dialog lets you "select" instead of "open" with the "Show in" drop down. This lets you use die Open Resource dialog for opening, but this function is kind of hidden. 
- Mixing Files and Projects in one Dialog would be wired. What would "open" even mean for a project?
- If you look at the use case for the Select Project dialog, an combination of both would be less user friendly:
* - If the dialog display both files and projects, the selection of only projects becomes harder.
- - If the dialog can be but into a "projects only"-mode, the user would have to do this every time. With the current implementation the user has to 1. press key binding, 2. type, 3 press enter. A fiddling around with settings would disrupt the workflow. Besides this, a "Projects only" mode would basically be my implementation.

So if this changes are acceptable, i see 3 open points:
* Key Binding. 
* There is currently no context help. I did not find any context help resources in platform.ui so i don't know where to add them.
* Testing. I am not familiar with what kind of test are required for platform.ui feature. I have only swtBot tests for my plugin at this point.

Sorry for being inresponsive for such a long time, Dieter.

I'm still not sure if adding another selection dialog is the right thing here. I requires the user to discover this new dialog, looks almost like the open resource dialog and adds some maintainance burder.

If we could add project as a result to the search dialog, I think this would be easier. We could for example disable the "Open" button and only use the "Show in" for selected projects.

What do you think?

I'm not sure how the workflow looks like you have in mind: 
- Dos the user press a new key binding that opens the "Open Resource" dialog that only shows projects?
or
- Does the user open the "Open Resources" dialog like usual and configures the dialog somehow so that them can select projects instead of files?

A good solution would imho be that projects are by default included in the result list. And if a project is selected certain buttons are getting disabled.

Yes this would be possible.
Such a solution would not have much common with the original plugin or with the changes of this commit. This means that this review can be abandoned.

Or it could be updated. Are you still interested in helping here?

I don't really think a new dialog is necessary. It adds some API (maintenance cost) and on the ticket, there is a proposal of a workflow that reuses the Open Resource dialog which seems more interesting to implement as there is already some habits and shortcuts with it.
