Hi Lars, IMHO this one would add to the usablilty of the dark theme on windows a lot and should be considered for 4.17. Not heavily tested though, and still lots of inconsistency between tables and trees.

My guess would that this path re-creates inconsistencies with EGit. Would it not better to fix SWT to provide a better highlight color?

Indeed, this patch creates inconsistencies with EGit. EGit shouldn't redefine the background color, but that is another issue.

The background color provided by SWT is the one provided by the OS. Configuration of this color in CSS has been removed, see bug report.

The configuration of the color via CSS did lead to fuzzy tree drawing artifacts, that is why it was removed. 4.16 had no selection highlight under windows, now SWT supports this in 4.17 so we are definitely better compared to the last release.

I would suggest to not rush with changes for 4.17, CSS changes tend to be very controversial.

Given the issue that are still there, its good not to rush these changes for 4.17. Its only too bad after all the hard work on the dark theme for windows, it is useless for daily usage due to this issue.

Dark theme on Windows was impossible to use (for me, I saw clients using it) on Windows before 4.16, 4.16 was ok but not good and 4.17 works fine for me.
