Patch Set 2:

It's a old one, but I think the feature would still be nice to have in Photon. That said, I didn't look at it for a while and this would probably require me another fresher look at the code and a rebase, so it requires some work to have it in.
I suggest that instead of rushing this in Photon, we plan it (ie assign target version, put in backlog on so on) for next version after Photon, and we work on it as soon as Photon is frozen.
WDYT?

Sounds good. Please proceed that way.
