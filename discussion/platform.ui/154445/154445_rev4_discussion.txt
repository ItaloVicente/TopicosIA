DESCRIPTION:

Bug 558279 - WorkbenchWindow menu not consistent with e4 model

- Call reconcileManagerToModel whenever updateActionBars is called, to
synchronize changes to the E4 model.
- Replace WorkbenchWindow#fill by
MenuManagerRenderer#reconcileManagerToModel as functionality is
duplicated.

I used this patch in a custom Eclipse IDE build for approx 1.5 days and I was not able to spot an issue with this.

Rolf, I suggest to merge this soon so that it gets a decent milestone testing. Thanks for working on this and for getting your menu and toolbar story to a maintained state.

I will try to do some more investigate what the possible impact is on the markers being handled differently, before pushing. Also will look into bug 439783 a little more, and probably push a separate patch to keep track of what fixes that one.

Pushed https://git.eclipse.org/r/154823 for the bug as mentioned.

Also separators can be handled as opaque items without any impact.
Line:1496, bundles/org.eclipse.ui.workbench/Eclipse UI/org/eclipse/ui/internal/WorkbenchWindow.java -> When the original separator/marker is not removed from the menu, it can be correctly handled as opaque item. No need to set the group_marker tag on opaque items.
