Ed, would you please add test cases validating your workflow will keep working in the future?

Patch Set 4:

I don't understand PDE's test framework details, and a large number of tests fail for me locally...

Here's the problem I have with all this:  If I were the lead of this project, I would revert all the changes, and I would insist that the folks proposing all the changes in the first place also write all the test cases themselves in the first place.  I.e., I would expect the work and review to be done with a broader/fuller understanding of the framework, and to be tested fully in that light, especially after it's already been established that the original changes break the extensibility framework. 

To err is human so where the necessary deep understanding is lacking, test cases should be added.  But none were added and the changes were committed yet again, without even the remotest possibility that they could actually work.  I'd already pointed out that ITargetLocation.searialize() needs to be called and yet again, in the latest commit it is completely absent. Clearly the review and the testing has been inadequate...

But of course I'm not the team lead, and I'm in fact nice enough not to simply jump up and down insisting the changes be reverted. Instead I invest two days of my personal effort helping fix the regressions.  

As such, I find the following things super annoying:

1) Lack of proper reviews in the first place.
2) Slow response to my efforts; none from the author of the original breaking changes.
3) Lack of a simple thank you for my efforts.
4) Effort invested elsewhere on formatting rather than on creating tests cases or reviewing my changes.
5) And to top that off, the expectation that I should also create test cases as if my attempts to help should be held to a higher standard than the original committed changes. 

Of course I fully understand why you want test cases, and I'm more than happy to create test cases, and to find all other problems with all these and other PDE changes.  But I  will ask first, is there somewhere I can send a invoice at the end of the month for this effort?  Because if not, I really can spend my effort on a great many other things (I do have projects of my own to manage) rather than fixing regressions in other people's code. 

My suggestion would be that the folks who value all these breaking changes are ones who ought to refocus any further effort toward creating adequate test cases.  I've provided more than enough information for the details, and of course Oomph is Eclipse project too.

Please open bugs for these so we can lower the barrier to entry. If a setup is not clear it prevents people from contributing.

Writing a test case for a workflow one doesn't know and is not part of the codebase is a tricky thing and quite unlikely to be done proper.

Hey Ed, 
I'm sorry that you see things that way. Clearly the project is understaffed (as many others). I agree that there is no one that knows the bells and whistles of PDE from the currently active people. With that said yours and Lucas's time are both spent on something you find valuable for yourself, for this reason. 
Regarding tests, I have spent a lot (personal) time to make (most, as I haven't checked all yet) PDE tests even run on gerrit commits for verifications, this was not there few months ago. I don't remember single thank you from anyone and don't expect it to be honest. It's important to remember that like every open source project it's community effort and the only way to ensure smth will happen is to do it. 
I dedicate enough time to keep the Eclipse TLP projects going to know that it's merely impossible to know all the places I do reviews but yet I do it as no one else steps up and there are still patches that provide significant functionality. As one doing a lot of releng for multiple projects the target editor saves me ton of time almost every day while I never use Oomph so I have no idea what taglets there do. I don't claim one is more important or the other - different people, different needs. But we have to move past the time of preventing every change because there is no one knowing what happened 10 years ago left and admit that new features will come at a price and it requires the whole community to help with that.
P.S. If you find whom to send invoices let me know :).

A thank you is always nice to get, and it costs nothing.  It's a great preamble to any comment.  Also, if you'd mentioned test cases as a follow up comment (e.g., "it would be great to also have a test case") rather than as what appeared to me be a prerequisite request for progress, I would have taken it in a different light.

With the other recent bug fixes I contributed to PDE, the setup for PDE now produces an error-free workspace.  As I find time in the coming days to refine all the existing setups for the platform, I will look more closely at the PDE's setup and in that context I will try running the tests again; the tests have dependencies on things that aren't normally in my target platform, making it harder to work with PDE Oomph together, which is what I needed to do to test the code in context.

Of course I can see the value that Lucas is contributing and that's why I was willing to invest time to fix the contribution rather than go with his proposed approach of putting back the old code. This way we can move forward together with the new code.  That being said, I do feel there was, is, and remains an obligation on the folks driving changes such as these, to create tests cases where they are currently inadequate, especially after the inadequacy has been established.  But as you said, when others fail to step up, the only way to get things done is to do them yourself.

On a philosophical note, progress is of course good, and arguably keeps the community vibrant instead of slowly stagnating away, but that must always be balanced to a significant extent against disruptive changes, because of course that is a very good way to drive a satisfied community into dissatisfaction.  In the end, the user will often not care nor notice small improvements, but when their favorite stops working, they will definitely notice and who will they blame?

Anyway, I do appreciate and thank you for all the effort you personally invest in the community.  The new source tab in PDE is a nice enhancement, so thanks to whomever implemented that too. :-)
