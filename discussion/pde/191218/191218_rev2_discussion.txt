As mentioned in the Bug report the problem has already been addressed in Equinox.
Therefore I think this should be abandoned.

Not because this change would not fix the problem (the change here was also discussed in the duplicated bug), but because it should not be necessary anymore.

should be enough for my usecase. Nevertheless i agree with https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=578564#c2 that it should have be done in PDE, not in osgi since the sort order is not API.

The problem is that there a multiple other locations in PDE that use getFragments() and could also be affected by an unstable ordering, as said in https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=578564#c7. Furthermore other consumers outside of PDE could relay on the same behavior although they should not have done that. And since sorting the fragments is not harmful and likely has only a neglectable performance impact (usually there are only very few fragments) this was IMHO the most robust solution with less work.
But if you want to implement that in PDE (and probably P2 has to be checked to) I'm not opposed.
