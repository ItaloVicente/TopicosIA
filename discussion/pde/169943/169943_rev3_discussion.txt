Wim, I have edited the patch to avoid throwing NPE and also externalised the string. Can you check if this works for you.

Thanks for reviewing, Vikas. 

You should include an exception in the log so that we have a stacktrace. Your solution just logs warnings without context. My solution logged context.

I still don't know what is wrong with my initial patch. Apparently it is "strange". I have no clue what this means. I would like to know for any future patches I submit to PDE. 

The reasoning for my solution was ignored.

PS
I did not know that PDE also translated error messages.

It's strange because you implemented control flow via implicitly and - even worse - explicitly thrown NPEs.

We dont have exceptions anymore. We log the warning before reaching the exception. Lets go ahead with for now.

Isn't throw/catch designed to change control flow? 

Sure, it is out of the box, and normally I would have used an ifthenelse structure but I needed the NPE for logging. This should really have been thrown by ManifestEditor.open(null, false) but it does not. in this way I can re-use the catch block AND have an exception for the stack trace in the log. 

Maybe we should not spent so much energy in fighting for the perfect solution, because there are always 50 ways to skin a cat. ;) 

Cheers, Wim
