DESCRIPTION:

Bug 527378 - Remove old way from testing pattern

The old and new ways of calculating bundles are only relevant if the old
way still exists. Since it doesn't, remove that call from the test.

nevermind, that's for legacy code as well.

I switched to assertEquals though and removed the api tools version bump from this change.

Was there a reason not to include the apitools/org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.generator/.project file in the commit? In patchset 8 there was a .project committed but in patchset 10 it was removed.
