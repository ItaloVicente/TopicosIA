Line:65, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/correction/AddExportPackageMarkerResolution.java -> why was this necessary? It seems you unconditionally overwrite the value passed in from the constructor, which lets the constructor look broken (i.e., passing a value that is always ignore).

I remember this change where I make a field redundant.
For multi-selection, we need to get package list from the current marker - so I introduced a field called marker in AbstractPDEMarkerResolution. Once marker was present, the field fValues is redundant especially for multi-selection.  Initially the class was designed in that way for quickfix to be single selection for that marker. I was hesitant to remove already existing field (albeit private). Now that multi-selection is present, a cleanup would help.
