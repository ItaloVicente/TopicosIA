LGTM. The code that consumes these XML files can deal with CR-LF line terminators in element bodies? (I presume so, especially since the last value was already followed by a CR-LF on Windows before, but better double check.)

As far as I can test in the _current_ IDE, yes. Manually changing the line terminators and disabling the automatic generation from Java to XML leads to everything still working. Also using the form based editor (of the service declaration) first tab and opening the property editing popup dialog works fine with all kinds of mixed terminators for a multi line properties element body.

Looking for the parsing mechanism I found code like while(reader.readLine()), which should work with this, too. I was not able to get PDE runtime up, unfortunately, so I couldn't give my change a real test drive.

When using Eclipse 2022-03 as development IDE you can launch a fully featured Eclipse-IDE with PDE by creating a new "Eclipse-Application" launch-config, change it to be based on "Features" (drop down menu in the Plug-ins tab) and select the the following features:
- org.eclipse.pde
- org.eclipse.platform
- org.eclipse.help (not necessary, but then you get an Eclipse-App equivalent to the the org.eclipse.sdk)

If you have "org.eclipse.sdk" in your target platform (which is unfortunately not yet the case when you have used the Oomph setup) it is sufficient to select only that.
