DESCRIPTION:

Bug 579230 - remove unused service.packageadmin.PackageAdmin

The only call of the PackageAdmin was false because it got the Bundle
from the host/the running platform. Furthermore the preceding code
always fails because PlatformAdmin implementation in use does not
support add/removeDisabledInfo anymore.

Line:491, ui/org.eclipse.pde.runtime/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/runtime/registry/model/LocalRegistryBackend.java -> This method as well as addDisabledInfo() seem to always throw an UnsupportedOperationException with the implementation of the PlatformAdmin from the org.eclipse.osgi.compatibility.state bundle.

So in general this whole enable/disable seems not to work anymore.
This code is reached when you open the 'Plug-in Registry' view and right click on a plug-in an then select disable.
Therefore I wonder if the entire enable/disable story can be removed?

Line:499, ui/org.eclipse.pde.runtime/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/runtime/registry/model/LocalRegistryBackend.java -> I suspect this code did never work because the bundle obtained bundle is from the host-app/the running platform since the this Plugin's BundleContext is used?

Definitely this doesn't work. Is there an easy way to make it work again?

It is also possible to disable/deselect units in the Target-Platform Editor.
But I think this simply does not add the affected bundles to the org.eclipse.osgi.service.resolver.State.

The BundleDescription could be removed from the state with state.removeBundle(desc) (but I have not yet tried this). But I assume the bundle is then entirely removed and would have to be stored somewhere else as disabled so it can be enabled again later.

But in general having two ways/stages (this and the Target-Editor) to disable bundles is IMHO not ideal because one has to check where a plug-in is disabled. Furthermore I assume this feature is not very well known (I did not know about it until I tested it for this Gerrit) and given that it does not work (probably for some time already) it can also not be widely used

I think we can remove these calls of PackageAdmin ( as isn't doing anything) but we should open a bug that either fixes enable/disable and related stuff in Plugin registry or removes it.
