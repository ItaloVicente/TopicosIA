Resolved your remark and inlined the isMatch() function since there is not much left to do.

Thanks, then you just need to increment the version of org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests so that the build can run.

I have just created a separate change 183524 that is associated with Bug 575106 where the version bump was not applied. I think we should not associated with this change, since it had nothing to dot with it.

Here with link:https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/pde/eclipse.pde.ui/+/183524

As soon this is merged, I can rebase this change which should then succeed.
