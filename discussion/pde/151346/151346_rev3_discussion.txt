> It's still necessary for the case where the refresh is asynchronous, I'm afraid. To demonstrate this easily, just close the view and reopen it – the first load is always asynchronous.

I can't seem to trigger this properly. When opening the view, the reset obviously does nothing because we're already at the top.

Patch Set 3:

Ha, that would be logical behaviour, but the asynchronous population often seems to result in the view being scrolled down to the bottom!

Perhaps it's platform / timing dependent? When I triggered the issue I probably had a delay coded into fetchDeferredChildren(), so maybe that will reproduce?
