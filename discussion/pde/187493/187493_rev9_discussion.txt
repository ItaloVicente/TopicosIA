DESCRIPTION:

Bug 577118 - Handle multiple Plug-in versions in launching facility

- Take only the latest version of a workspace/target bundle if multiple
versions are present and no version is specified in the launch-config
- Replace selected target-bundles only by a workspace-bundle if it has
the same Major-Minor-Micro version
- When writing bundle entries, check if there are other bundles in the
same container (workspace or target-platform) to decide if the version
is written and not only check the number of 'active' models

Ok, make sure to do this backwards compatible though. All combinations of old/new eclipse and old/new equinox should work together (preferable without version checks in PDE against the target).

Line:142, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/ClasspathHelper.java -> That would not be compatible to an "old" equinox. We could write an additional <id>_<version> entry and leave the <id> entry as before (items from one/last version) or merged.
The new equinox would then look first for the <id>_<version> entry and prefer that if it exists.

Line:382, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> add();
return true;

is clearer IMO

That's a good suggestion. If PDE would have to require the corresponding org.eclipse.osgi it would be cumbersome.

Furthermore I thought again about the logic when plug-ins with same version should be discarded and concluded it should not be changed regarding workspace plug-ins and only target-bundles with the corresponding workspace plug-ins with same MMM-version should be discarded (see in code comment for details).

Additionally I removed the possibility to obtain the workspace/target-bundle set without filtering same versions. This avoids possible inconsistencies between the list of selected plug-ins displayed in the UI and the list actually used to set up the launching application in the end.
Line:142, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/ClasspathHelper.java -> That's a good suggestion. I have implemented it accordingly.
I'm also about to prepare a corresponding patch for Equinox.

I think we should only take the entry from the last version to leave the 'old' behavior unchanged.

Furthermore the entry should just be put into the properties and should not be merged, so an existing entry is simply overwritten.
An entry is only present if you have a plug-in that is in your primary dev-workspace also in the workspace of your launched Eclipse app (secondary workspace) and launch a third Eclipse app from there. Then you only want the class-path entries from your secondary-workspace's plug-in because that's the one used in the third app.
Merging them together is IMHO just wrong because the plug-in in the primary and secondary workspace can be completely unrelated (even though they have the same symbolic name).
Or do I miss something?

Furthermore when the entry is just put into the properties we also automatically preserve the 'old'-behavior for the legacy non-version mapping.

Line:142, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/ClasspathHelper.java -> I'm not quite satisfied marking this off as a legacy-case. Developing against older targets without the equinox support will be the norm for quite some time to come, so I want to keep behavior changes there to a minimum (even if this behavior is not obviously specified).

I'm ok with the current implementation if you say it behaves the same as before, but please show that in the testcase then.

Line:142, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/ClasspathHelper.java -> Sorry for the extra work.

I fully agree that the behavior is not obviously specified. But because it wasn't specified before (which Plug-in actually ended up as value in the Map<String, IPluginModelBase> until now was also just randomly the last plug-in specified in a launch config because getMergedBundleMap still used a LinkedHashMap back then), I suggest to leave it unspecified now as well. Especially this only affects the legacy-case to be.

Performance-wise I don't matter as well, I would just save the additional code/logic for sorting and keep thinks simple.

If the List values were sorted, but I don't think they are? They are added in the order they appear in the HashMap from getMergedBundleMap().

Line:142, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/ClasspathHelper.java -> I missed that getMergedBundleMap returns a linked HashMap. But IMO that's too far away from this usage to assume that the order is always correct - and that the poor reviewer understands it ;)
So I would prefer an explicit sort here - even if it's unnecessary. Performance wise that should not matter, there should not be that many different versions for one id.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:142, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/ClasspathHelper.java -> Additionally the logic to just take all dev-entries of the currently running eclipse seems to be wrong, if one launches an Eclipse-App, that does not use the running-platform as target. If for example an ordinary .target file is used that pulls in build bundles from an p2-repo the classpath of those bundles should not be extended with the dev-classpath of plug-ins of the same name in the primary workspace. Otherwise if one launches another Eclipse-app from the secondary workspace the classpath of the launched bundles would be incorrect.

Since this topic becomes bigger, I think it should be handled in a separate bug/gerrit.

That's indeed right and reasonable.

To the best of my knowledge it is, but as you said, it is not obviously to trace.
Yes, I just have adjusted the test-cases accordingly.

I have created Bug 577543 for this and a resolving change and added you to both.

Yes, they are not sorted and appear in the order of the map from getMergedBundleMap(), but getMergedBundleMap() returns a LinkedHashMap. So in the end the values appear in the order as they are written in the launch-config and later entires overwrite earlier ones.
