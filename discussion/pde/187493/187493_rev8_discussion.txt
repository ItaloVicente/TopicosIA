DESCRIPTION:

Bug 577118 - Handle multiple Plug-in versions in launching facility

- Take only the latest version of a workspace/target bundle if multiple
versions are present and no version is specified in the launch-config
- Replace selected target-bundles only by a workspace-bundle if it has
the same Major-Minor-Micro version
- When writing bundle entries, check if there are other bundles in the
same container (workspace or target-platform) to decide if the version
is written and not only check the number of 'active' models

Line:314, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> The only scenario I can think of where a plugin exists with multiple qualifiers in workspace is when you have the sources (with .qualifier) and additionally import the binary project (with build qualifier). In this case I expect only one version to survive.

So if I understood you right, I'm pro simplification.

Regarding your remark in Bugzilla:
Before PDE can write different dev-file entries for multiple version support for this has to be added in equinox. I can take care of this and will link the bugs/Gerrits as soon as I have created them.
Line:314, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> Agree. I cannot think of any other (relevant) scenario.

Great. Do you think one of the two should be preferred or should it be unspecified? I'm not sure which one is the right one then.
Maybe PDE should create an error in the Manifest in such case to make users aware of two plug-ins with the same symbolic-name and version so they close one and break the tie manually.

I will add another test to the change of Bug 577385 to demonstrate the behavior change.

Furthermore the idVersions Map<String, Set<Version>> can be changed to a Map<String, List<Version>> because each version has the be checked any ways when attempting to add one, so a HashSet only requires more space.

Line:712, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> At the moment, when you for example have one 'plugin.a'-1.0.0 in the workspace and plug-in 'plugin.a'-2.0.0 and 'plugin.a'-2.1.0 in the target-platform and you select one or both bundles from the TP an entry without version is written for each selected bundle from the TP. So if you selected both you only get the latest one ('twice') or if you select version 2.0.0 you end up with 2.1.0 in your running app. This is why I think it should be improved. :)

Actually it should be sufficient to only check more multiple versions in the same location (so workspace or TP), but simply checking the combined number of workspace+TP-bundles with the same symbolic-name would make the code in BundleLauncherHelper simpler.

Line:1100, ui/org.eclipse.pde.unittest.junit/src/org/eclipse/pde/unittest/junit/launcher/JUnitPluginLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> Even better. Done.

Line:314, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> Agree on that.
Nevertheless I thought about it again and if for bundle/plugin-based launches only one workspace-plugin with the same MMM-version is allowed, it should also be the same for 'feature-based' or 'default'-launches in order to be consistent. But this would require more changes. Furthermore if it is generally not supported by the launching-facility the user should be informed about it in form of errors in the Manifest, for example (again more changes). And since OSGi/Equinox has no problems with two bundles (AFAIK, but correct me if I'm wrong) with same MMM-version I think this would be an unnecessary restriction for the user that in the end adds more complexity than it saves.
Therefore I reverted it to the previous behavior and adjusted the methods, so that in the end only an additional BiPredicate has to be passed, which specifies when two versions are allowed to coexist.

Line:314, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> There are indeed none. If you are interested: I looked it up in the specification.
In OSGi-8 (https://docs.osgi.org/download/r8/osgi.core-8.0.0.pdf) section 4.4.1 "Bundle Identifiers" says that
"The combination of Bundle Version and Bundle Symbolic Name is a globally unique identifier for a bundle."
But "Tough the pair is unique, it is possible to install the same bundle multiple times if the org.osgi.framework.bsnversion framework launching property is set to managed or multiple,[...]."

So not only is there no restriction regarding same MMM-version but different qualifiers, it can even be allowed to have two bundles with same symbolic-name and exactly the same version (depending on bsnversion which defaults to managed).

Exactly.

Perfect, then I just have to remove the TODO :)

I thought that's the previous behavior? When there are multiple versions in the specific location, the version must be specified.

> but simply checking the combined number of workspace+TP-bundles with the same symbolic-name would make the code in BundleLauncherHelper simpler.
The question is, are there drawbacks to having a "redundant" version specified. For the launcher code itself it shouldn't matter (--> testGetMergedBundleMap_singleWorkspacePluginVersion_notMatchingVersion), but what about the UI?
Would it show plugin.a_1.0.1 as selected with this launch config or would it show nothing as selected and clear SELECTED_WORKSPACE_BUNDLES upon saving?

Previously BundleLauncherHelper.writeBundleEntry() only considered the 'Active-Models' set to check if multiple versions are present. But the active-models are, if present, the workspace-models and if no workspace-modles are present the target-models of a ModelEntry. This can lead to the scenario described above.

Do you mean how the UI behaves if there is 'plugin.a' version 1.0.1 in the workspace but 'plugin.a*1.0.0' specified in the launch config (and no other 'plug.a' in the workspace)?

I have just tested it and observed that in this case the launch config is automatically changed and saved (without notifying or prompting the user) to have no version for the entry of 'plugin.a', as soon as the launch-config is selected in the Run/Debug Configurations wizard. When multiple versions are present but not version is specified in the launch-config the entry is changed to the latest version and if multiple versions are present but none matches the entire entry is removed.
From this observations I assume the Wizard simply gets the merged-bundle map from the launch-config and then re-writes all entries with BundleLauncherHelper.writeBundleEntry() so that they are in their exact form.

With this in mind writeBundleEntry() should definitely write versions for target-bundles even when a workspace-bundle with same id is present. Otherwise, in the scenario described in my previous answer, all target bundles but the latest would be deselected when the launch-config is opened the next time in the UI.

Regarding the original question, if a version should be written only if multiple bundles are present in the same location or if it should be written already if more than one is present in workspace+TP combined:
It only makes a difference if for example when one has 'plugin.a-1.0.1' in the workspace and 'plugin.a-1.0.0' in the TP and then creates a launch-config where workspace and target bundle are selected and later replaces in the TP 'plugin.a-1.0.0' by 'plugin.a-2.0.0' and additionally adds 'plugin.a-3.0.0'.
If for 'plugin.a-1.0.0' from the TP no version was written, then 'plugin.a-3.0.0' is selected, if version 1.0.0 was written no plug-in is selected.
If a single-version bundle is replaced in the TP by a new version it should not make a difference because BundleLauncherHelper selects the the only model if the version does not match.

With this I think a version should only be written if multiple bundles are present in the same location, which also corresponds to when BundleLauncherHelper is graciously reading not matching versions.
