DESCRIPTION:

Bug 577118 - Handle multiple Plug-in versions in launching facility

- Take only the latest version of a workspace/target bundle if multiple
versions are present and no version is specified in the launch-config
- Replace selected target-bundles only by a workspace-bundle if it has
the same Major-Minor-Micro version
- When writing bundle entries for launch-configurations, check if there
are other bundles in the same container (workspace or target-platform)
to decide if the version is written and not only check the number of
'active' models
- write versioned-entries to the dev.properties to enable different dev
classpath-entries for different versions of a bundle
