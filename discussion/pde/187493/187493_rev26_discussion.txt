DESCRIPTION:

Bug 577118 - Handle multiple Plug-in versions in launching facility

- Take only the latest version of a workspace/target bundle if multiple
versions are present and no version is specified in the launch-config
- Replace selected target-bundles only by a workspace-bundle if it has
the same Major-Minor-Micro version
- When writing bundle entries, check if there are other bundles in the
same container (workspace or target-platform) to decide if the version
is written and not only check the number of 'active' models

When I run the build locally, I was able to reproduce the failure. While setting up the build Debug environment I noticed that the TP (at least in my workspace) does not contain the latest o.e.osgi version. After importing the the o.e.osgi project in my PDE-dev workspace the tests also failed when launched from the IDE.
It turned out that the reason for the failure was that I have not adjusted the dev-classpath enhancement performed in org.eclipse.pde.launching.JUnitLaunchConfigurationDelegate.collectExecutionArguments() to write versioned entries too.
So your suggestion would probably have brought me on the right track (maybe even faster).

I have adjusted JUnitLaunchConfigurationDelegate accordingly and created methods in ClasspathHelper to get and add correct entries from/to a dev.properties object with the new entry-schema, so that the logic of the two entries is at one location.

Actually it is obvious that this had to be adjusted as well, but afterwards one is always wiser.
It's great that we had the tests here, they definitely prevented trouble.
Line:99, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/JUnitLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> I have chosen this approach to get the host-plugin of a fragment considering the specified version to make sure only bundles selected for launch are considered. Other approaches like the following might select bundles that are not selected for launching:

IPluginModelBase hostPluginModel = PluginRegistry.findModel(fragment.getPluginId(), fragment.getPluginVersion(), fragment.getRule(), null);

or 

HostSpecification host = fragment.getPluginModel().getBundleDescription().getHost();
BaseDescription supplier = host.getSupplier();
if (supplier == null) {
	abort(NLS.bind(PDEMessages.JUnitLaunchConfiguration_error_missingPlugin, fragment.getPluginId()), null, IStatus.OK);
}
IPluginModelBase hostPluginModel = PluginRegistry.findModel(supplier.getSupplier());

Absolutely, I completely missed that part too.
Line:98, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/JUnitLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> let's name this getFragmentHostModel to not confuse it with the mechanism to pull junit runtime bundles from the host eclipse.

Line:99, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/JUnitLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> ok
