Thanks Peter.. Minor feedback inside. I'm personally not a big fan of inheritance of tests. Maybe you can move common code into an Util class which is then referred to by the tests?
Line:8, ds/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/pom.xml -> Remove ws

Line:27, ds/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/pom.xml -> Are they not? Would be nice if new tests actually run in Maven Tycho.

Line:1, ds/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/projects/test0/.gitignore -> I think that is covered by the repository .gitignore file

Line:3, ds/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/projects/test0/.project -> If the project file is not needed, I would prefer to leave it out, so that this test code is not imported as project by accident. If you prefer to keep the project file I would suggest a name which groups the project closely to the test project.

Line:6, ds/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/projects/test0/src/ds/annotations/test0/Activator.java -> Remove?

Line:6, ds/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ds/internal/annotations/tests/Activator.java -> I suggest to remove this Activator, looks like it is not needed and adding Activators is IMHO a anti-pattern.

Thanks Lars. This is an early "draft" as I wanted to get feedback on the overall approach. It's still very much a work in progress -- I need to add more scenarios to extend test coverage (btw, is there a test coverage tool that's used by Platform/PDE?)

Please note that these are more like functional tests rather than unit tests -- they test the overall functionality as integrated with PDE and JDT using various use-cases (test projects with annotated classes). I see a similar approach being used in PDE itself (UI, DS, API tooling, etc.)

The approach involves using several "test" projects (I'll be adding more) with annotated classes that serve as test subjects; the unit tests then verify that DS Annotations code treated these projects/classes as expected. This is what one would do when verifying functionality manually. These projects are version-controlled (in their source form) under org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/projects (for easier development). They are not imported into the build workspace; rather, they're used in the test runtime workspace (imported by the test suite upon startup).

As far as test inheritance -- the base classes only implement test setup/cleanup, which is infrastructure-like code (not actual tests) that is required for the actual tests to run (depending on test type). If I were to move that to a utility class, I'd have to duplicate all those calls in actual test classes, which doesn't seem very efficient/elegant. This way when a test extends the right base class, it automatically gets the right setup/cleanup behaviors.

Line:8, ds/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/pom.xml -> Ok.

Line:27, ds/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/pom.xml -> I copied the pom from org.eclipse.pde.ds.tests. I'll remove this.

Line:1, ds/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/projects/test0/.gitignore -> This is a test project imported into test runtime workspace (as is), not into build workspace. This is normally added to new projects by egit, but I can remove it (I don't think egit is used in test runtime workspace anyway).

Line:3, ds/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/projects/test0/.project -> I believe it's needed in order to import the test project correctly -- upon test suite startup, I import these test projects into the test runtime workspace so DS Annotations can generate xml descriptors. The unit tests then verify the output.

Line:6, ds/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/projects/test0/src/ds/annotations/test0/Activator.java -> For this test project, I just needed some arbitrary code to be there (not a component). Activator is generated by default so I left it there. Remember these are "test" projects with mock code in them.

Line:6, ds/org.eclipse.pde.ds.annotations.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ds/internal/annotations/tests/Activator.java -> The tests do need to get access to BundleContext (to load resources) and this is the easiest way to do that. Do you suggest an alternative approach?
