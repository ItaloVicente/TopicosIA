Line:502, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/target/TargetPlatformService.java -> What if the argument was already properly escaped?

Line:502, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/target/TargetPlatformService.java -> I doubt that this could be the case. Or it would appear wrong in all other places where a vmarg could be used. Don't you think so?

Just put this lines to eclipse.ini of your Eclipse and debug with your patch:

-Dname="Albert Einstein"
"-Dname=Albert Einstein"

Lines above will be double quoted

PS: if you wish to continue, please rebase on master and increment bundle version.

It turns out that you're right and it's even more difficult because apparently escaping is also supported. For example the following does also work and preserve the escaped quotes:

"-Dname=\"Albert Einstein\""

I'll try to find a smarter solution...

So I verified the behavior of a dozen alternative inputs. The most important thing to note is that all these -D declarations do only exist so they become *system properties*, i.e., key/value pairs. So anything we do to fix the problem must preserve the key and the value of the system property.

As I mentioned before, both your eclipse.ini examples do not lead to the correct system properties!

This also means that if someone specified quotes in the vmarg in eclipse.ini she definitely wants to see these quotes in the resulting system property.

In addition with the original problem that unquoted spaces in the eclipse.ini lead to invalid TP definitions and launch configs that leads to the following very simple fix:

   vmarg = vmarg.replace("\"", "\\\"");
   vmarg = vmarg.replace(" ", "\" \"");

The first line makes sure that existing (wanted!) quotes make their way into the system property.
The second line makes sure that spaces don't break the command line parser.
