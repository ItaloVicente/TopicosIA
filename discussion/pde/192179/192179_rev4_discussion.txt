Line:153, apitools/org.eclipse.pde.api.tools/src/org/eclipse/pde/api/tools/internal/search/UseScanManager.java -> I assume the additional "localmonitor.split(1);" was not intended?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Has PDE also moved to Github? I get an error while trying to push an update.
Line:153, apitools/org.eclipse.pde.api.tools/src/org/eclipse/pde/api/tools/internal/search/UseScanManager.java -> Nope, sorry for this.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I assume only pde.build has moved, because it's the only repository that is present in eclipse-pde: https://github.com/eclipse-pde

But I did not recognize any announcement that pde.ui has moved.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> At the weekend I was able to push to refs/for/master without any issues.
But you have pushed a branch "origin/change/192179/20220325113407" on Friday. Maybe this was not your intention?

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thanks Hannes. Indeed looks like my default push configuration went to "origin/change/192179/20220325113407". Not sure what changed, AFAIR my configuration has not changed. Looking forward to have all projects moved to Githu to have one commmon flow again.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> You are welcome.
Sometimes (E)Git is magic.^^ Can you delete that branch or ask the webmaster team to delete it (the same happend to me as well and I was not able to delete it and asked them to do it)?
Yes and hopefully on GitHub we as committers get the right granted to delete (non master and non maintenance) branches.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Lets wait with the branch cleanup until we moved to Github. I would love to get rid of all the old and outdated branches. We tried a few years ago and failed as people were not ready for branch cleanups but IMHO the move to a new repo is a good chance.
