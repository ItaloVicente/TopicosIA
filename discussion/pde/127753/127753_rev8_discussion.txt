DESCRIPTION:

Bug 538110 - suppress auto build for irrelevant MANIFEST.MF changes

Every MODELS_CHANGED event triggers a classpath update and an auto build
for all dependent plugins. Whitespace changes or adding/removing
Service-Components do not affect the subsequent build and therefore
should not trigger it at all.

On resource changes the manifest headers are now compared and
MODELS_CHANGED is only fired when there were actual changes to headers
that affect PDE state.

It is too late for -1, have reviewed very important Sonar patches.
Line:42, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/WorkspacePluginModelManager.java -> See org.eclipse.pde.internal.build.IPDEBuildConstants

EXTENSIBLE_API, PATCH_FRAGMENT, ECLIPSE_XYZ, PLUGIN_CLASS

als org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.ICoreConstants
almost all ECLIPSE_XYZ headers, AUTOMATIC_MODULE_NAME, SERVICE_COMPONENT, IMPORT_SERVICE, etc.

Almost all those should trigger build too.

Suppressing the MODELS_CHANGE does not suppress the build of the changed plugin. It prevents an "updating plugin dependencies" and therefore suppresses the build of dependent plugins.

Changing SERVICE_COMPONENT without triggering a build of all dependent plugins was the initial reason for this change.

But you *have* to update plugin dependencies on EXTENSIBLE_API, PATCH_FRAGMENT etc. Please go over the constants I've mention and pick those which are missing here.

This reads like a sarcastic statement. Please avoid such comments. Discarding the work of contributors as not important is not something we, I speak now as PMC member, want to see in the top-level Eclipse project. I would also guess that this is not in sync with the Eclipse code of conduct.

Thanks for the content feedback.

Julien, I assume we do not have to revert this and that you will provide an additional Gerrit for additional constants. 

Please let me know if that is incorrect.

I would add:
* Eclipse-ExtensibleAPI, Eclipse-PatchFragment
* Eclipse-PlatformFilter
* Eclipse-GenericCapability, Eclipse-GenericRequire, Provide-Package: --> deprecated alternatives to existing white-listed entries

Seem irrelevant for dependent plugins at build-time:
* Eclipse-BuddyPolicy, Eclipse-RegisterBuddy
* Plugin-Class, Bundle-Activator
* Bundle-ActivationPolicy, Eclipse-LazyStart, Eclipse-AutoStart
* Automatic-Module-Name
* Eclipse-SystemBundle
* Service-Component
* Eclipse-SourceBundle, Eclipse-SourceReferences
* Eclipse-BundleShape: ("This header is only used by the build and provisioning systems to determine how to deploy a bundle")
* Eclipse-JREBundle
* description stuff like Bundle-Vendor, Bundle-Description, ...

comments?

I think these are very rarely changed / used. So adding them to the white list should not regulariy affect build times. I would suggest to add them. But I have no strong opinion, so if Markus or Andrey think they can be skipped, that is also fine for me.

Depends on your definition of regular ;)

To be more specific: I think the following headers must not trigger a lengthy build on large workspaces like Markus' and ours.
* Plugin-Class, Bundle-Activator
* Service-Component
* Bundle-ActivationPolicy, Eclipse-LazyStart, Eclipse-AutoStart
* description stuff

On the rest I could agree to "better safe than sorry".

Julians, I'm fine with your suggestion. Please prepare patch, and be prepared to add more fields if Andrey and Markus want that.
