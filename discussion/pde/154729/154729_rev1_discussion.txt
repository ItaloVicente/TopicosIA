DESCRIPTION:

Bug 205705 - Don't re-synchronize resolved IUBundleContainers

During TargetDefinition.resolve, P2TargetUtils resolves all
IUBundleContainers in a single pass. When IUBundleContainer::resolve is
called after that, the container is already resolved.

Calling P2TargetUtils::synchronize again would then pointlessly
re-resolve this container. Even worse, because the P2TargetUtils
instance is shared across all IUBundleContainers, it would re-resolve
also all other containers.

In effect, given a target with N IUBundleContainers, each would be
resolved 2N+1 times (2x by resolveBundles/Features of every container
plus the initial single-pass).

The P2TargetUtils::synchronize call is only guarded by a resolved check
and not removed completely for the case where only a single container is
resolved instead of its parent TargetDefinition.

Alexander, can you do a sanity check?

I don't see any issues with my workspace and I'm fairly certain that the logic was originally intended like this.
Example: The totalWork amount for container.resolve is explicitly reduced when there's a synchronizer attached (TargetDefinition:419).

Julian, the change looks good and works quite fast for already resolved .target files.
