Line:1162, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/launcher/FeatureBlock.java -> Isn't the checkbox always selected before performApply is called? Why is there already a (correct) working copy available at this point?

I think it would be easier to understand, if the selection listener updates a Boolean field which is then persisted here if != null.

I think I don't understand the question.
My intention why I added the assignment of fLaunchConfig was to ensure it is always up to date. But maybe this is overcautious, because it is the duty of other parts of the code to ensure this and to call initializeFrom() then.
I'll remove that.

> I think it would be easier to understand, if the selection listener updates a Boolean field which is then persisted here if != null.

I tried this first but unfortunately it does not work because if when switching between Plug-ins and Features in the drop-down menu only performApply() for the block one is switching to is called. So if one for examples checks the box, switches from Plug-in to Features that would not be written to the config.

Line:1162, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/launcher/FeatureBlock.java -> Now I understand what you mean.
After reverting the button state is indeed not saved because, as you said, the block is initialized with a non-working copy. But in all other cases I observed (i.e. a newly created Launch-config and when opening an existing one) there is always a working-copy passed to initilizeFrom (it looks like its the on stored in LaunchConfigurationTabGroupViewer).
But when reverting performApply is called multiple times before the user can interact with the UI, so if I add the assignment "fLaunchConfig = config;" to the performApply methods of both blocks it should work.

> If the other block-specific properties are not applied when switching, isn't it correct to also not apply the state of the checkbox?

I think for this checkbox this is not correct, because the same attribute is used for both Features and Plug-ins, which is not the case for most of the other check-boxes that only affect attribtues used in either Feature- or Plug-in based launches.
The only boolean-attribute that is also used by both is "Only show selected" and it shows the described strange behavior and forgets previous state changes when you switch between Plug-ins/Features.
So I think the new button does better in this regard.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:1162, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/launcher/FeatureBlock.java -> My assumption (primarily from the given types) is that initializeFrom is called with a read-only (non working-copy) launch config. Only the launch config instance passed to performApply is then (guaranteed to be) in a writable state.

E.g. see LaunchConfigurationTabGroupViewer.handleRevertPressed() --> initializeFrom is called with a different instance

> [...] only performApply() for the block one is switching to is called
If the other block-specific properties are not applied when switching, isn't it correct to also not apply the state of the checkbox?

Line:1162, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/launcher/FeatureBlock.java -> In that case, I strongly prefer that we don't rely on the writability of fLaunchConfig and use the Boolean field approach.

The "strange behavior" of those two checkboxes can then be fixed in a follow up (e.g. by calling performApply on the old block in BlockAdapter::setActiveBlock).

I adjusted the change accordingly.

OK that's reasonable, lets do it that way. When looking at BlockAdapter I have the impressions that most of the methods there would benefit from being called on both blocks all the time (e.g. setDefaults).

But I will take care of that after the move to GH.
