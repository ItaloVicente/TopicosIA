File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> @Julian what do you think about this change?

Besides the UI layout the technical work is (almost) ready.

The only problem left I have to address is that the check-box in the Launch-Config UI is always unchecked by default even for feature based launches, when one creates a new launch config it starts as plug-in based for which requirements are not added by default. But when switching to feature based the config is saved becasue AbstractPluginBlock/FeatureBlock.performApply() is called which sets the selection into the config.
I think this could be handled by only setting the not default value to the launch-config. But it could lead to other strange behavior if one switches between plug-in and feature launches.

That sounds reasonable to me.
Line:117, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> typo

Line:118, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> why do you consider fragments as required here? Because of symmetry to AbstractPluginBlock::addRequiredPlugins?

I would ignore them completely, same as for feature launches. The add required button at least has the possibility to deselect them afterwards.

Line:98, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/RequirementHelper.java -> I think a Set<IPluginModelBase> containedPlugins parameter would fit better.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I found a IMHO good solution:
The value of the new constant is written in the selection-change listener so it is only written, when the box is (un-)checked. As long as the check-box is not touched there is no value written so it sticks with the default when one switches from features to plug-ins and vice-versa.
Ones the checkbox was touched the value is written and the check-boxes stay at that value for plug-ins and features.

At the moment the checkbox for the Plug-ins would not be updated because the subclass PluginBlock of AbstractPluginBlock does not call "super.initializeFrom(config, enableTable)" every time. But I created a preceding change to adjust that and CCed you there.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I implemented in the way that non-default values are written to the config and if the default value is selected the attribute value is removed (i.e. null is written). This should ensure that the value displayed in the UI is always persisted correctly. If a default value were not removed it could happen that after switching between Plug-ins and Features with certain value combinations the value that was stored in the launch-config did not correspond to the checked-state of the button.

In general the facts that the check-boxes for the Feature- and AbstractPluginBlock are independent and that the method performApply() for both blocks is called very often but the the content of the launch-config is only read when the blocks are created make it more complicated than expected. Another contributor to the difficulties is that FeatureBlock.initializeFrom() is called on every switch to the FeatureBlock while AbstractPluginBlock.initializeFrom() is only called when the Plugin-Block is created for a config (so only once).

In some scenarios the check-box changes its state that could be unintended but with the current implementation at least the initial scenario when one creates a new config and switches from plug-in to feature (and back) without changing the checkbox it sticks at the corresponding default.

In general these dialogs would benefit from major rework to unify and clean them up but that's definitely out of scope for this change.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Yes this is indeed not ideal. I'm not sure what the best way would be.
I also thought about having two separate fields, but I did not like it much because it adds extra fields for actually the same thing that just has a different default in different context. Then also the consumer code-locations have to be adjusted and have to use different attributes.

I think the ideal way would be if the state of the field is only written when the launch config is really persisted, when one hits "Apply", "Run/Debug" or "Close" and chooses to save the config. But I have to check if this is feasible.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Thank you for having a look at this.

I have updated the change to change the UI to option 5 and renamed the labels, fields and constants similar to what was suggested in the bug.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I wonder if removing a persisted value is intuitive for the user when switching between launch types after explicitly checking that box. Have you thought about persisting two separate fields?

You are right.

Line:118, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> No I meant deselect: You hit the button, some random fragment (and its dependencies) gets selected and then you'd have the possibility to deselect those manually before launching. With the automatic launch option, that's obviously not possible, so I wanted to exclude them here like you did.

Yes, that was the reason.

You mean to select them? If Options.INCLUDE_NON_TEST_FRAGMENTS is not passed they are not automatically included so one has to select them (either one by one or by pressing "Add Required").
However I'm fine with your suggestion and adjusted the code accordingly. :)

Line:98, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/RequirementHelper.java -> You mean instead of "Predicate<IPluginModelBase> containsPlugin" and "Consumer<IPluginModelBase> addPlugin"?
But how could I then handle the case of the other overload of addApplicationLaunchRequirements() where the backing datastructure is a Map? The keySet view of a map does not allow additions. Instead of the Consumer the method could collect all requirements to add and for example return null if requirements are missing. But IMHO this makes it more complicated in the end compared to now.
