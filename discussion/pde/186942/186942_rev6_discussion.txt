The tests look good, thanks for your effort!

Can you extract the tests into a separate commit before the changes to BundleLauncherHelper - so we can see what behavior actually changed?
Line:241, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> yes. If nothing is specified, only the latest version should be included

Line:261, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> is that scenario deterministic? and if yes, how?

Line:329, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> that's unintuitive when looking at the testcase, but should be fine in practice IMO:

a) you create plugin with version 1
b) it's deselected in the launch config
c) [some time later] plugin gets a version increment

--> it should still be disabled

Line:542, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> Is this a hypothetical scenario or can you actually create such a launch config via the UI?

Line:561, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> same question as above

Line:619, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> to which comment are you referring to?

Line:632, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> I would name this assertGet* as well

Line:656, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> wouldn't it be easier to have a setDummyBundlesAsTarget(List<NameVersionDescriptor>, Path) instead of the two separate methods?

I think that only an exact version match in workspace should override the plugin from the target.

Sure, I can do that, but I think we should first resolve the remarks on the test to not create to much confusion. With this commit the behavior is not intended to be changed. But adding the test in a previous commit is a good way to 'prove' that.
Line:329, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> Understand it. That makes sense.
I will add your explanation as comment in the code so that the argument is not forgotten.

Line:619, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> I'm referring to the FIXME comments above.
I meant that if a target-platform bundle is ignored even tough it is specified should not depend on if it is selected explicitly or automatically. The criteria for discarding target-bundles should be the same.

Line:632, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> Yes, thanks for that hint.

Line:656, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> Yes, you're right. I changed TargetPlatformUtil.setDummyBundlesAsTarget() accordingly.

Should I leave this comment in this change to remove it with the subsequent change or should I remove it already in this change?

Line:261, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> That's a good question. I think it is not deterministic since it just picks the first model it encounters, but I have checked it, it is possible (but I'm in doubt it is meaningful).
I mainly added this case because there in an explicit check to not include the same version twice.
It was introduced with https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=312322

Line:261, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> Yes with that respect it is deterministic.
Both methods obtain the workspace plugin-models with id "plugin.a" (an array) and take the first model in the models-array that matches the given version (1.0.0). The relevant methods are BundleLauncherHelper.addPluginModel() and AbstractLaunchTest.getModel(). The plugin-models array is created from an ArrayList that is not modified in between, so its element order should not change as well.

Making the version changes as small as possible to make the intention more clear is something that I also planned to do for the other cases.

No you cannot create such launch-config. I just skipped the workspace bundle version for convenience, because the workspace bundle's version is not relevant in this case. But you are right, nevertheless it should be realistic. So I have changed that.

However the logic if a version is written or not when creating such launch-configs is IMHO flawed at the moment.
It only considers the number of active models at the time the entry is written, no matter if it is a workspace or target bundle entry.
So if you have two versions of 'plugin.a' in the TP and one in the workspace and select one target-bundle, no version is written because the (single-element) Set of workspace bundles is considered the active set. When you specify both target bundles, two entries with no version are written.
But I will address that in the follow up change/bug and add a test-case for it.

Line:542, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> It is totally possible to select a bundle from the TP with same symbolic-name but different version like a bundle in the workspace and the entries are written correspondingly into the launch-config.
In AbstractPluginBlock the methods getExternalModels() and getWorkspaceModels(), which seem to provide the selectable children of the bundle-Tree in the Plug-ins tab, return all workspace and external plug-ins (and only filter non bundle and source-bundles, depending on the preferences).

Or do you mean if it is possible to have no version for the workspace-bundle but a version for the target bundle?

If the replacement behavior of target-bundles is changed in the follow-up change/bug, so that a target-bundle is only discarded if a workspace-bundle with same id and major-minor-micro-version exists (as you have suggested in one of your previous general comments and is IMHO the best logic), then the target-bundles will be added any-ways. So there is no need to worry anymore about that.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:619, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/PluginBasedLaunchTest.java -> I think the scenario from the FIXME above should be avoided by the UI and not appear in practice. That launch configuration is simply ambiguous.

This case here can actually happen though when you add plugin.a_1.0.0 in workspace after the launch configuration has already been created.
IMHO the behavior/implementation of AUTOMATIC_ADD is chaotic. AUTOMATIC_ADD should behave like when you manually add each newly created project to all existing launch configurations. In this scenario this would have also added the version to the selected target bundle.

But that's not the case and the implementation - bad as it is IMHO - is quite clear: every WS plugin that's not explicitly deselected gets pulled in.
So I would not change this behavior now.
