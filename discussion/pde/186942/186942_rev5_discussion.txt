I added extensive tests for all combinations of explicitly specified and automatically added workspace plug-ins and target plug-ins that I could think off.
The tests all pass with this change and the state before. However I added some remarks about results that I think are not ideal and should be improved in a follow-up change (that I'm currently preparing in a first iteration).

When creating the test cases I also tried to consider corner-cases like
1. a launch-config that was created and saved when only one version of a bundle was available and therefore no version was written, but later another version of that bundle was added (to the workspace or the TP)
2. a plug-in/bundle in the workspace and a bundle in the TP but both have different versions. When building in the workspace PDE does not consider target-bundles if a corresponding plug-in with same Bundle-symbolic-name is present in the workspace (I assume it is because they are then not considered 'active'). Nevertheless it can be required to add both version (from the workspace and the TP) to a launched Eclipse-App if e.g. another plug-in in the TP requires that particular version from the TP.

Therefore I think a bundle selected in the target platform should be included even if a similar workspace plug-in is present.

What do you think about it?
