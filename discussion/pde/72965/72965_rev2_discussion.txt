You can trust me that I used a new workspace when writing so ;-)

First, there's nothing coming from JDT if you have a general project. If unsure you can also try this in the Navigator view.

Second, I don't care too much where it is coming from. It's just missing the accelerator and the same happens in the Java editor for me.

This menu does not appear if you don't click on on Java file, you
cannot test it on general project

If accelerator does not appear on Java file its not THIS menu.
Is there way to spy on menus to see whos menu it is?

Of course I can, there *is* a 'Compare With' menu in the context menu on a general project. The original bug is not targeted to PDE (just assigned). It's about the missing accelerator.


 > If accelerator does not appear on Java file its not THIS menu.

No one said so ;-), but the bug report speaks about the context menu in the Java editor, which does not appear fixed to me on Windows 7.


 > Is there way to spy on menus to see whos menu it is?

In general yes (Menu Spy, Alt+Shift+F2), but this only works on concrete menu items, not on the cascade menu item.

This fixes PDE menu. If you see other one, bug is not fixed, but it
should not stop you from pushing this one.
I think the other one coming from eclipse.team, I will check it out

Can you provide steps where I can see in the UI that it fixes something?

Do not launch with ALL plugin. Select all PDE plugins, add dependencies recursively and ide.application plugin if it was not added.
Use Shift-F10 to bring the menu (right click won't show any accelerators)
If you not sure change the name of the menu (like I did) to test

I checked eclipse.team, it does contribute this menu but it has accell as well. My other suspect is releng

I'm not really interested in special set up cases but the plain Eclipse SDK.

Just to be clear: I don't say the fix does not fix anything, but it does not fix the Java editor (and other cases).

If I recall correctly, I tried that without luck.

You asked how to check fix in PDE. I answered. We can try to chase
who else contribute this menu, but it won't be this fix. The only way to test this is not to load the other plugin, which I suspect is releng and not part of SDK anyway.

Aha. Use PDE to debug! Plug-In Registry search for Compare With.

Good catch! That's it, along with the PDE patch.
