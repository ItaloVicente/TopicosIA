Dani, as you've suggested, I've changed the commit message and also removed all .gitignores from the individual projects - instead, they're all under test-builder.

I've also realised that, because I didn't branch to create the change, it's apparently dependent on the fix for 355310. :-( There is no true dependency. I'll get more to grips with Git in the end!

It goes into the right direction, but can still be simplified by using placeholders. Take a look at the .gitignore file in the root of the pde.ui repository.

Also, you can rebase your next change on master, so that it can be submitted without a dependency.

"It goes into the right direction, but can still be simplified by using placeholders. Take a look at the .gitignore file in the root of the pde.ui repository." Hmm, I'm not sure what you mean. The new .gitignore looks very similar to the one in the root of the repo. In the root file, the pattern used is '/*/*/bin/'. However, the test projects are unfortunately not so neatly laid out as the production projects, so they're all at different depths, requiring different rules... unless I use '/**/bin/', which seems a bit dangerous, in case a folder called 'bin' is legitimately used. I could use the following:
/*/bin/
/*/*/bin/
/*/*/*/bin/
/*/*/*/*/bin/

... but again, it feels a bit unspecific.
What I have done in this next commit is ensure each line has a slash at the front and end to ensure it's dealing with the path from this .gitignore and that each 'bin' ignored is a directory, not a file.

"Also, you can rebase your next change on master, so that it can be submitted without a dependency." Thanks for the hint - hopefully my next commit will be without that dependency.
