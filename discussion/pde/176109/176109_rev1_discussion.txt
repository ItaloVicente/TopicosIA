I think we need to be a more consolidated story about that; eg how this would similar feature be used in the IDE ? What are the expectations at dev-time?
From here, we can implement things more consistently. I believe that for API tools, the dev-time (IDE) has to drive the build-time (headless-app).

Alright. Simply specifying one or multiple p2-repos as baseline would also be a great feature for the UI. And I agree that consistent capabilities are definitely desired and the UI should drive the build.

Nevertheless UI and build don't have the exact same requirements and same capabilities. For example for the UI one can use Oomph's 'APIBaseline(FromTarget)Task' to specify the Baseline based on a p2-repo without the need for a target-file in the workspace. This isn't available for builds.
Also the Oomph's capability to aggregate a baseline target from multiple modules seems to be a very handy feature if you have multiple "modules in your workspace (this seems to be possible only with the 'APIBaselineFromTargetTask'). It looks like this is the way the API-baseline is created when using the setups for the Eclipse Platform repos/modules.

I've not yet used the 'APIBaselineTask' yet, but from its source code looks like that it simply downloads the entire p2-repo (but does not include any requirements of follows references to other repos, it just downloads the files at the specified URL) and sets the downloaded directory as default API-Baseline. For me this isn't exactly what I intended.

So in the end you are right Mickael, we should think about a more consolidated story that's also available in the UI (maybe Oomph will adapt it then with it's 'APIBaselineTask').
I just learned that the P2-Mirror application used by Tycho to assemble a p2-repo can follow requirements (is this more light-weight than a planner? What's the difference to resolving a corresponding TP by the planner?). Maybe this is a good fit to include requirements (if available) of the plugins to check.

Should we go back to the Bug-Report to further discuss this?

Oomph isn't part of PDE, so inconsistencies with external project can happen. I was more thinking about "intra-PDE" consistency.
That said, if we can find a generic way have the headless API analysis able to use external API Baseline description formats with generic PDE code, that would be a welcome enhancement.

Tycho does first run the planner to resolve dependencies, and then invokes the mirror later with the result of this dependency resolution. So overall, Tycho is actually driven by the planner. Mirror doesn't do any dependency resolution.

Whatever fits your workflow best, I'll follow ;)

Alright, I will think about a more consolidated solution and will then come back to discuss it.

OK, good to know. Thanks for this explanation.

I just thought about other people that could be interested in the future what we have discussed :)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I'll see what I can achieve tomorrow, but I likely won't be able to complete this in time. 
I probably will perform a final update here and will then abandon this in favor of the move to GH by tomorrow evening.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Or you can manually migrate to GitHub when migration is done. You just need to keep a note of this gerrit and open. GitHub PR when migration is completed.
