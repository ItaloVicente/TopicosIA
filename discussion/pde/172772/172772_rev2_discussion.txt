Does it work as expected? I believe this will not work for ctrl+shift+f1, because it will need the data saved in the actual shell

It did work as expected. Note this change is only for the LayoutSpyHandler, not for the other spies that extra the data from the shell.

Perhaps that alone means we don't want this fix? I leave it to more experienced people. I don't use layout spy enough to remember the keyboard shortcut and before the change to remove the quick actions text box I don't think this was a problem to use the quick actions as a way to find it.

I had considered in the error case providing a message box instead reminding the user of the keyboard combination. WDYT?
