DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575929 - Product configuration editor bug in update site maintenance

Fixed the following issues:

1. The URL is no longer initialized with http://
2. No attempt is made to prefix the url with 'http://' after pressing ok
3. The url must not only be valid but also contain some content besides
the protocol
4. The 'OK' message shown by default by the StatusDialog has been
suppressed
5. The same issue was found in the category editor so I now moved the
RepositoryDialog class into its own file to also re-use for the category
editor.
6. Also fixed the category editor
