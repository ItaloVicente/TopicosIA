DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575929 - Product configuration editor bug in update site maintenance

Fixed the following issues:

1. The URL is no longer initialized with http://
2. No attempt is made to prefix the url with 'http://' after pressing ok
3. The url must not only be valid but also contain some content besides
the protocol
4. The 'OK' message shown by default by the StatusDialog has been
suppressed
5. The same issue was found in the category editor so I now moved the
RepositoryDialog class into its own file to also re-use for the category
editor.
6. Also fixed the category editor

No no it is fine. Quality over quantity. I did not mean it that harsh. Thanks for giving your time to review my mess. :)

Line:86, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/dialogs/RepositoryDialog.java -> schemes are case-insensitive
you could compare location.toLowerCase()

Line:2566, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/pderesources.properties -> //

Hello joerg, thanks for your review. You comments were already discussed in change set 3. Please take a look and let me know.
Line:86, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/dialogs/RepositoryDialog.java -> Karsten, the previous reviewer asked me to remove that :). Since this was old behavior, I suggest to keep it like this. This is functionality that was not here to begin with and not related to this bug,

Line:2566, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/pderesources.properties -> This was also discussed before. file:/ is valid in some situations:
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_URI_scheme#How_many_slashes?

@Karsten: could you please reconsider tolowercase 
@Wim: I am sorry for the back and forth... i had not read the other reviews. 
i am sure about tolowercase but i do not know the context if relative URLs make sense - i just thought thats a typo.
Line:86, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/dialogs/RepositoryDialog.java -> go lowercase! "Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier

Line:2566, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/pderesources.properties -> you quote the URI (UR"I") definition. But you state that it is an URL ("L") here. file:/ is only a relative URL - relative to the current host. Honestly i don't have a clue what this code is all about ;-) if a relative URL should be allowed there then keep the on slash.

Line:84, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/dialogs/RepositoryDialog.java -> Is it mandatory that we only allow the fixed list of http, https, file? Whats the reason? why would we not allow for example ftp:// or ssh://. 
you could also first create the URL instance and then limit the interpreted scheme of that URL - if required.

Jörg, thank you for your review.

Jörg,all your questions are relevant. However, they do not belong to the context of this bug. The bug is that we could not enter an https:// url. I have fixed this bug. I also encountered the same in the category editor. That is why I refactored and removed duplicate code. 

The other issues you have found are not introduced by my patch and belong to another bug report. I agree that it would be nice to fix but my time is limited and I have already spent way too many hours on this very simple change. 

Please accept and submit.
