DESCRIPTION:

Bug 531602 - [GE TP] .target file formatting - Indent when adding UIs

 - When adding a software site the result ended up in one long line
 - Now the result is indented correctly
 - Also fixes the issue of FeatureBundleContainer's not having an ID
 - Also fixes issues of multiple containers with the same repo not being
kept, now when updating containers are stored in a list by repo, and
units are stored by container not repo

There is an unfortunate aspect to PDE's structured editor. In particular, there exists IUBundleContainer.getRepositories() so one IU bundle container supports multiple repos and of course those are serailized and deserialized correctly.  E.g., the following is fully functional:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?><?pde version="3.8"?><target name="Generated TP" sequenceNumber="1">
  <locations>
	<location includeAllPlatforms="false" includeConfigurePhase="true" includeMode="planner" includeSource="true" type="InstallableUnit">
      <unit id="org.eclipse.sdk.feature.group" version="0.0.0"/>
	  <unit id="org.eclipse.nebula.widgets.tablecombo" version="0.0.0"/>
	  <repository location="http://download.eclipse.org/nebula/snapshot"/>
	  <repository location="http://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen"/>
	</location>
  </locations>
</target>

But you can't edit this structurally and if you try to, for example, to add a repository to the above, that simply doesn't work well at all.

I'm not suggesting that there ought to be a big focus on making that work properly now because it's clear that we would end up with the same problem of not being able to map between old and new elements for the IUBundleContainer cases as in the generic container case and this is clearly the common use case for the Target editor, so that no longer working would defeat much of the purpose of all these changes.

In any case, it's great that you've noticed that the feature ID wasn't transferred properly!  Good work.

And it's even more great to see an extension example! Thanks!! It's very simple but in the end, it's the serialize method that needs testing that it's handled and properly transferred to the serialized *.target, so this trivial example with a nested element is a good idea.  As a suggestion, perhaps you should consider adding an attribute to the location element and to the message element to more fully test that such attributes are properly reflected in the final serialized *.target.
