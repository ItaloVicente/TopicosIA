DESCRIPTION:

Bug 570166 - error marker for unavailable JRE import package

The following manifest had unresolved imports, but did not show any
error markers:
	Import-Package: javax.xml.ws
	Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment: JavaSE-11

Because there is a resolved supplier for this package (even though it
does not satisfy the given BREE), no marker was shown.
This change ensures that the "No available bundle exports package"
marker is created for every unresolved import except when a more
detailed error marker is available.
