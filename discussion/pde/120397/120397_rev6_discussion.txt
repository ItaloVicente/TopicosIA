DESCRIPTION:

Bug 531555 - More relaxed scheduling rules for builders

The SchedulingRule for builders is now the aggregation of the various
PDE projects. This doesn't include workspace root and is more
relaxed, to allow other projects in the workspace to take advantage of
parallel builds. PDE build is still non-concurrent as we
currently don't know whether PDE builds can run and PDE state can be
modified in parallel from different threads.

Patch looks fine to me, but I cannot note a difference in performance. I guess this is because the JDT builder is still blocking the whole workspace. 

Any concerns here, if I do not here concerns I plan to merge it soon.
