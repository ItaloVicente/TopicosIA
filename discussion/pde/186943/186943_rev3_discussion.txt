No problem. :)

I want to mention that some of the method extractions here are also done in a way that fits to the subsequent changes and require less changes there.

Line:160, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> With the current code, I don't understand why those are multiple maps rather than a single merged one. Is that required by your subsequent changes?

Line:181, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> previous comparison was case-insensitive

Line:186, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> I don't think this is correct. Previously workspace models were ignored with LOCATION_EXTERNAL.

Line:259, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> shouldn't be this the first comparison as the old code terminated upon finding an exact match?

Line:361, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> could be replaced with AUTO_START_LEVELS.containsKey

Line:160, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> With the current code, yes.
For example with the change for Bug 576888 it can be the case that a feature from the workspace is picked as feature specified in the launch-config (I assumed that just the latest version from the preferred location should be picked for listed features in the launch-config). At the same time e.g. a feature from the TP specifies a specific version (e.g. a higher one) of that feature as an included child feature. In that case I assume that the feature with a perfectly matching version should be picked. If this happens for the same feature-id it would not be possible to pick each feature version in case either all IFeatures are merged into one map or if external features are discarded if there is a corresponding workspace feature.

But I admit that it depends on the strategy we want to use here how to handle multiple versions of the same feature. Therefore I suggest to leaf this point open until I have written the test cases for the subsequent bugs/changes and we came to a conclusion how to handle all of those cases.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:160, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> With the new logic it is required for both included and required features to distinguish them by their location because for both cases the latest feature is taken from the primary location if any (match-rule obeying) is present (and in case of included features no exactly matching version is present).
If the features of both locations where in one list the latest one from both locations would be chosen.

So I think this cannot be a Map<String, List<IFeature>>. However I changed it to be a Map<String, List<List<IFeature>>> in the latest Patch-Set since it corresponds to how features are available and is also likely faster and IMHO more clear.

Line:160, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> In this scenario we could still use a single Map<String, List<IFeature>>, right? But yes, let's leave that point until you're done.

Line:181, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> Indeed.
Because the constants are lower case and I assume that their value will never change, converting the defaultLocation to lower-case in the switch header should be sufficient to restore the previous behavior.

Line:186, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> You're right. Looks like I kept findModel(ModelEntry, String, String) in mind.
It should be?
featureModels = Collections.singletonList(fmm.getExternalModels());

Line:259, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> It depends. The previous code terminated upon finding an exact match before checking if the candidate is resolved only for the first model (if model==null). For all subsequent models it was checked if the BundleDescription is resolved before checking if the version is a perfect match and immediately terminating.
Now it is the same logic for all models regardless of their order.

IMHO resolved bundles/plug-ins should be preferred over non resolved.
