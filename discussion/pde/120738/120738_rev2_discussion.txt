@Ed would you be able to confirm that this new patch does not break any of your scenarios and then if you have some scenarios you wish to be added as test say them as well. I will hold off on removing the WIP tag until we have tests confirming that it does not break Oomph's Targlets again.

It looks okay, but I'd need to test it.  I'm not sure if the Gerrit job produces an update site I can test, and ci is currently unresponsive.

I'm traveling all next week.  As soon as this is a build (and I'm back April 14th) I can test it, so please let me know.
