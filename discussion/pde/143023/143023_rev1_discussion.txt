@Peter Thanks for the contribution!
Please provide unit-test(s) to ensure that it works as expected.
Line:445, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> It can be inlined inside the next method, otherwise we are asking for the attribute two times

Line:468, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> Probably, this block can go inside the "try" block above

Line:501, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> Do we need additional StringBuilder here?
In any case it will be good to see the JUnit proof for this utility.

Line:507, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> Please add brackets

Line:508, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> is it "start".lenght()?

Line:511, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> Please add brackets

What's the expected behavior with both existing config.ini and configured start levels in the launch config?
With your patch the launch config will be ignored completely - that doesn't seem right.
Line:425, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> this doesn't resolve the system startlevel/autostart defaults, when bundle is not present in the supplied config.ini

Why not simply overwrite 'sl' with the value from the map?

Line:456, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> "handle" -> "load", "parse", ...

Line:477, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> Please refactor the parsing logic from EquinoxInitializer for reusage instead of copying it.

In the old days when config.ini was respected. Which is the case for Oxygen relase, the config.ini would be the "expert" choice and all other settings regarding start levels and autostart were ignored as far as I experienced it.
This is a regression from my point of view, cause it blocks launching PDE with a specific sequence (I know that this is not best OSGi practice), but for the AspectJ and XSLT Transformations it is mandatory.
I will try to incorporate the findings from the reviews.
Is there still an option to get it into this release or a bugfix?
What is the latest date for submission.

Can you describe (in bugzilla) why exactly a manual config.ini is required?

No, the 2019-06 release is essentially complete. Any change here would come with 2019-09.
