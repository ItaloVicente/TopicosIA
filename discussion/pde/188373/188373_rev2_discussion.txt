looks sensible to me, but I haven't tried it out yet.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> typo

Line:99, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/ClasspathHelper.java -> yes please ;)

Line:164, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/TargetWeaver.java -> This changes solves the whole workaround, doesn't it?

Line:192, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/TargetWeaver.java -> though

Line:193, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/TargetWeaver.java -> checking for directory is not just slower, it's simply wrong (TP may contain unpacked bundles after all), so I would remove this comment

Line:220, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/TargetWeaver.java -> can't you use FileLocator.getBundleFile here?

Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> Done

Line:164, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/TargetWeaver.java -> Not in all scenarios I can imagine.
With the subsequent change it would still be necessary if there are not two bundles with same name and version and one comes from the host workspace and another one from a p2-repo for example.
With this change it is necessary if there are two bundles with the same name.

It would only be completely solved if we were using the canonical bundle file-path as key instead of id(+version). But this would require more file-system operation and would likely lead to a worse performance in the end.

Line:192, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/TargetWeaver.java -> Thanks.

Line:193, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/TargetWeaver.java -> Sorry, this comment is unclear. You're right only checking if the location is a directory is not sufficient, but bundles from the Running-Platform have to have a directory location. So it is a necessary but not sufficient condition.
In my first approach I tested if the location is a directory as preliminary check but it turned out to be slower than calling findRunningPlatformBundle() directly. That's how the comment was mode.
But I will just remove it to avoid any confusion. :)

Line:220, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/TargetWeaver.java -> Yes definitely! It's remarkable how fast one can forget solutions that he just recently proposed. 😒
I was just looking for an as efficient implementation as possible and obviously reinvented the wheel and forgot FileLocator.

But I did some benchmarks and noticed that this approach is significantly faster than FileLocator.getBundleFile().
For TargetWeaver.weaveRunningPlatformDevProperties() using FileLocator resulted in a runtime of 5~6ms compared to 0-1ms with this approach and I use an NVMe SSD (for Hard-Drives it will likely be more). But I have opened https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=577574 and proposed to improve the implementation of FileLocator.getBundleFile() to this approach.
