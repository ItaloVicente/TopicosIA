DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576568 - org.eclipse.pde.core.target.TargetFeature should support a
(protected) constructor without a file

- Add a new constructor to allow passing an IFeatureModel model directly
into the field for extension classes
- remove the null checks (the model was never null and a null model is
not useful either

@Christoph Thank you so much for eliminating another `null` in PDE!

One question. We discussed a bit API around TargetFeature and found that we would like to avoid API breakage at this stage. And then you are introducing "TargetFeature implements IAdaptable". Do you think it could be considered as breaking change? Since "org.eclipse.pde.core" does not re-export IAdaptable - I think it could.

At least the API tools did not complain (yet?) :-)
We could remove the interface and let the class extending TargetFeature to decide if it uses IAdaptable or a dedicated Adapter, what do you think?
