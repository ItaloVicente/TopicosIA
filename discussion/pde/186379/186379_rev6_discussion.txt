======================================================================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576568 - org.eclipse.pde.core.target.TargetFeature should support a
(protected) constructor without a file

- Add a new constructor to allow passing an IFeatureModel model directly
into the field for extension classes
- remove the null checks (the model was never null and a null model is
not useful either
- make Feature#hasRequiredAttributes protected

Do you think it could be considered as breaking change? Since "org.eclipse.pde.core" does not re-export IAdaptable - I think it could.

So, it will return null for "pure" TargetFeature instance? Looks a bit artificial.
There was an additional accessor for IFeatureModel model in your previous PS - I would use it instead of adding IAdaptable. This would be a non-breaking extension of TargetFeature "interface", clear and null-free because of the latest improvements.

Yep but actually for file-based features the location is (obviously) always non-null and will never use the IFeatureModel anyways.

As the IFeatureModel was never accessible before and Eclipse complains that IFeatureModel is an internal type in an public class I think the Adaptable approach might be better here?

Line:769, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/feature/Feature.java -> Should I open another PR for that? The problem is that extension otherwise have to copy this method as it is not accessible.

Or it could register an IAdapterFactory to provide this adapter later. OK.

Ah, I missed that IFeatureModel is internal type. In that case yes, Adaptable is better.
Line:769, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/feature/Feature.java -> Yes for the current formulation since it talks about constructor only.
Or you can change Bug and Gerrit formulation to cover the need to access some methods.
