This is ready from my side, I'll open other PRs if more changes are still required so we have as small as possible increments.

Can we avoid `null` as a legal value
Line:69, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/target/TargetFeature.java -> Do you think we really need to allow `null` here?
Why don't we throw CoreException like above?

The whole 'null' story is rather strange... actually I have the feeling null was never a valid value and also never was used, because about 80% of the code checks for null the other part just don't care and the paces where I checked the model is either nun-null or an exception is thrown anyways preventing the usage of nulls. So my idea was to simply complete the missing 20% of allowing null, what would result in someone extending TargetFeature to pass null as the model and simply override all methods (that's bad but certainly currently the only option I see, see below).

From a software-architecture perspective it would have been better if TargetFeature+TargetBundle where simply an interface so different implementations are possible, but I don't see how this could be changed without breaking the ITargetLocation interface.
Line:69, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/target/TargetFeature.java -> CoreException is only thrown from loadModel(File) as we are passing an already constructed object (or null) there is no need here.

Actually, null would be required if one wants to implement a TargetFeature independent of IFeatureModel, but as TargetFeature is not an interface... The best indeed would be a ITargetFeature interface but I'm not sure if that's possible without introduce an API break.

Line:69, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/target/TargetFeature.java -> I understand, the whole API needs rework and this is hardly possible.

What if we introduce some "UnresolvedModel extends IFeatureModel" to use instead of `null`?
Well, but it will require to introduce more ane more because of the current structrure of API.

Ok, I see.

Yep, at least not without introducing more clutter, eclipse-platform is really missing a modern strategy for handling such changes, anyways I think this can provide at least a workable solution for the rare case where this API is actually used.

So I'd like to ask for a PDE committer to approve and merge this fix if there are no concerns as this does not really harm/change anything but make it more extensible.

I can use my new superpowers. Please provide a decent commit message. Gerrit says merge conflicts. Do you need to rebase?
