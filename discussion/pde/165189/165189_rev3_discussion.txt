DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564251 - OSGi launches source bundles

There has been divergence of the PluginBlock and OSGiBundleBlock since
they were first created. Some of the optimisations done against
PluginBlock were not avaliable in OSGiBundleBlock.

Since both OSGiBundleBlock and PluginBlock inherit from
AbstractPluginBlock, move the contents to the parent class in order to
take advantage of both and reduce code duplication.

I like it overall! Lot's of duplicated code removed.

What remains is the issue of initialization via the launch shortcut.
IMO we should eventually just support the launch with "all bundles..." mode also for OSGi.
Problematic is the fact, that osgi launch configs currently use the USE_DEFAULT attribute to distinguish between bundle-based and feature-based, instead of USE_CUSTOM_FEATURES. So that would need a migration strategy.
Line:7, /COMMIT_MSG -> nitpick: your change does the opposite ;)

Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> typo

Line:87, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/OSGiLaunchConfigurationInitializer.java -> We can't remove this initialization.

Lazy initialization works when a launch configuration is created in the dialog, but would break the Run as > OSGi Framework launch shortcut.

Eclipse launches are configured with "all bundles" by default, so they can do that lazy init.
I'm wondering why OSGi launch configs don't support that launch with mode.

Line:133, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/launcher/BlockAdapter.java -> that should work for both block types, no distinction necessary

Line:87, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/OSGiLaunchConfigurationInitializer.java -> OK, I'll remove it from this change set. We might need to revisit your earlier change to do the filtration here then.

Line:133, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/launcher/BlockAdapter.java -> Done
