DESCRIPTION:

Bug 564251 - Stop OSGi launching source bundles

There has been divergence of the PluginBlock and OSGiBundleBlock since
they were first created. Some of the optimisations done against
PluginBlock were not available in OSGiBundleBlock.

Since both OSGiBundleBlock and PluginBlock inherit from
AbstractPluginBlock, move the contents to the parent class in order to
take advantage of both and reduce code duplication.

without the modified initializer, your changed does not have any functional effect, correct?

Then please open a separate bug for this cleanup.
Line:87, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/launcher/PluginBlock.java -> those guards are missing in your change

No, the change in the UI removes the check that looks to see if the set has already been set and allows overriding it; otherwise the UI isn't the prime selector of what's available. In effect, the removal of the guard in line 87 enables the UI to work regardless of what the iniitalizer does.
Line:87, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/launcher/PluginBlock.java -> That's true; that's because the initialize doesn't re-initialize if 'true' is passed in iff it's been set before. however, it does get set before by the Initialize set, so we need to remove these guards to enable the UI to select what bundles are actually going to be run.

The UI must never override a preexisting bundle set. The initializer - and more importantly: the preexisting launch configuration - must always have precedence.

In that case, this isn't the right solution. Suggest we revert to your earlier one.

BTW Julian if you want to build on this for refactoring/cleanup work of PDE, feel free. It might not solve the problems of the source launches but it may be desirable in general clean up.
