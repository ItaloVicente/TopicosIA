Why do you want to specify the default explicitly?

Patch Set 2:

Because it's in the same repository and is needed in order to build and test against the checkout you've used. Otherwise it will attempt to find it from the SNAPSHOT or resolve again from the upstream repository, which is not what you want. Most other pom.xml files already have the relativePath to their parent for this effect; this one doesn't.

I'll admit that I don't have that much experience with maven, but as far as I understand, "<relativePath>../</relativePath>" has exactly the same effect as not specifying it. 
There's not a single pom with that explicit relativePath in my eclipse workspace.
