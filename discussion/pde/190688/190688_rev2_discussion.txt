What you've done sounds similar to my fix in Bug 536592. Though that covers only build dependencies and would miss Require-Capability here, so probably not helpful.
Line:178, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/tests/internal/DependencyManagerTest.java -> I think we need an additional test with this set of bundles/fragments, but without INCLUDE_*_FRAGMENTS

I already stumbled upon the bug you mentioned and wanted to suggest some possible improvements for it, but I plan to open another Bug later and first focus on my currently open ones.
But as you said, this would not help here because Require-Capability would be missing.

In general I'm confident (from my testing and what the doc says) that this change as it is should solve the problem.

Nevertheless @Tom could please have a look at this too, could there be another pitfall I oversaw?
Line:178, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/tests/internal/DependencyManagerTest.java -> This is already tested in Line 208/209.
This test method calls findRequirementsClosure() with and without INCLUDE_ALL_FRAGMENTS. Without the previous code that first call respectively the subsequent assert fails.

In testFindRequirementsClosure_includeNonTestFragments findRequirementsClosure() is called three times, once without any literal and once with each INCLUDE_*_FRAGMENTS literal to test the different behavior.

For me this change is ready for submission.
@Julian if you agree, I would like to submit this tomorrow (Monday) morning, to add this and the follow ups in time for M3.

I would postpone this as well, especially the switch to feature-based launches would be better early in M1.

Postponing the switch to feature-based launches is reasonable. It is also not very urgent because one can still switch to feature based launches manually.

Nevertheless I think this change should be submitted now, because it is actually a fix of the resolution of Bug 351396. Without this change  the dependencies of a test-fragment (e.g. junit or others) are still pulled into a launched application.
Julian, do you agree?

For the direct follow up change (for Bug 578644) I'm uncertain. It is kind of a new feature, but it makes the use of feature-based launches more precise respectively avoids pollution of the launched application as displayed in the associated bug. But since there is also a small risk that there are users that want it exactly as it and will complain (although I cannot think why, but I was already surprised in that regard) I'm +-0 for postponing this as well.

True, let's merge this change now then (and leave the rest for next release).

Great. Alright, that's a plan.
