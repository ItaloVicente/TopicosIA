Agree.

I could also remove even more pom.xml files if I would use pom.model.property.* in the build.properties.

I had a discussion with Mickael a while ago and he recommended to not use this feature of Tycho because it lacks tool support and is not very well known so it could be hard to understand for others why the build behaves as it does.
I totally agree with this argument, but on the other hand there a many pom.xml files that only set a property value which I would like to get rid of. So I'm torn in this regard.
Maybe if I add a comment to the pom.model.property.* entries it could be easier to understand.

What do you think?

Do we have good documentation on Tycho side? If the comment can point to tycho documentation explaining how this is used it should be fine. But this is for another patch for sure.

The only doc I found about it yet was a release note. But if there is no better documentation this would be a good cause to add some.

Yes that's fine.
