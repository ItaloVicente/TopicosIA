Hi Vikas,

thanks, I must confess I have not noticed that but now looking at the implementation details I see that there is no feature editing support at all in XMLEditingModel and Co. So in fact we should not allow to force the current feature version into included features, because will have no effect. Therefore in the last patch set I made the last (third) radio box invisible in the wizard, if it is opened from the included features page.

I hope you can find some time to review updated patch.
