Lets try with emojis. If that works for most platforms, we should be fine.

Doesn't work for Win7.

I could add a guard for Win7 to not show the icon on Win7. Win7 is unmaintained by Microsoft, isn't it?

That could also be said about Java 8 ;) Both are (sadly) still widely used.

Also I don't see how any emoji could coexist with an explicit icon for the same action used elsewhere. E.g. the proposed direct hit emoji (https://emojipedia.org/direct-hit/) - it just doesn't look anything like the regular target platform icon.

As opposed to what I said earlier, I think we could try to improve support of SVGs in codemining, but that would introduce new APIs, risk of performance issue and cost a fair amount of effort.
In my quest for emoji support, at this point, I would suggest that we replace all reference to the Target Platform in the whole IDE by emojis, which would probably be less effort than adding support for SVGs in code minings.

It sounds like very separate effort that can be started without dependency with this one.

From my point, Emoji support needs to be implemented on SWT/JFace level first, with all the platform-specific problem handling.
Probably something like 
Emojis.prepare(emojiIdentifier).orElse(staticImageUri).draw(gc);

Those are all echos of the same root issue in general in Eclipse Platform which is lack of obvious support for scalable images.
An enhancement to Code Mining API to better support SVG would be welcome and/or utility methods to better handle emojis like you suggest would be welcome.
In the meantine, there is currently no way to get scalable images as code minings, beyond using emojis. So it's a choice between: 1. no image, 2. not scaled image or 3. emoji that don't render well on Win 7.

I vote for  3. emoji that don't render well on Win 7.

+1 to that, I was assuming we put in a check for Win7 and only add the emoji if we are not running on win7 if we go for this suggestion

That sounds good to me.

I'll reduce it to -1 then ;)

This is a gross misuse of emojis IMHO. Showing a search emoji in a search bar is completely fine. But how should anyone *intuitively* understand what's "A dart board with dart hitting the center / bullseye region." is supposed to represent?

Also try pasting it in an editor - can you even make it out at that size?
(https://emojipedia.org/direct-hit/)

Having no icon seems completely acceptable to me. If anything I would prefer the regular target icon in the vertical ruler.
