Isn't there an emoji that could be used here instead of the icon?

Are emojis supported on all platforms?

Last time, they were missing on Windows where they're printed in black IIRC. This is an okay-ish behavior, and at some point, it will be more than necesary to support emojis on Windows if we want to reduce the amount of instances of similar issues about icons, increase consistency with the OS, reduce disk and RAM footprint...

For this change, lets stay first with a regular icon. Once we start moving the platform to emojis, we can revist this implementation. Michaels desire to drive emojis in Eclipse should be handled independently of this change.

To me, the fact that icon doesn't react to font change size makes this change way less interesting. That's also a benefit of emojis, and I now remember it's a reason why we decided to not care about images in code minings.
As the added-value of an icon here is low, and as the lack of scaling can be perceived as an ugliness, I'd be in favor of not applying this change.
One possible compromise is to load the image from the SVG if we have it and draw it from here. But this needs to be carefully implemented: loading SVGs (and maybe even pre-rendering them according to font size) must not happen in the UI Thread.

Please open a new bug for the missing scaling of images in code mining. This in IMHO an issue to be handle independent of this change. As long a emojis don't work on Windows these cannot be used in platform. Do you have a bug for their support?

I won't. Raw image by definition are bitmaps with a pre-set size and cannot scale nicely (best result need some complex algorithm that are really not the scope of the IDE), I don't think an effort on that matter would be profitable. Let's just assume that Images cannot scale.
SVG could be another story though as they're vectorial and not specific to a size so they can scale.

Also SVG support is a big topic and should also definitely handled via their own bug report.

Is it that emojis don't work on windows are just black and white? If the later I think we are free to go with emojis.

Mickael, do you have a suggestion regarding exact emoji code that should be used for this particular mining instead of "target" image?
