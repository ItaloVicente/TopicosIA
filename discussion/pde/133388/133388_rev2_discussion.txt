InformationSection has windows line endings. Can we convert all of PDE once and add some CI check to reject future commits with windows line endings?

I suggest to convert files on a as-needed basis via a separate commit and rebase this on onto the new one. 

Converting all files at once is also possible if you feel strongly about but this will affect the possibility to see the Git blame history without any real improvement if the code remains otherwise untouched.

> add some CI check to reject future commits with windows line endings?

As the project settings are now Unix, this should not happen unless another editor is used. If you are aware of a way to check that in CI, please open a new bug and post the solution.

The current patch set still has windows line endings.

With autocrlf=true git checks out that file as-is with \r\n, but converts it to \n (on windows) during commit, causing those massive diffs.

To fix that, I have to disable autocrlf temporarily when committing that file. --> the committed line endings only depend on my local gitconfig, not sure where any project settings would apply.

Didn't know that. So if you know how to setup a check in our CI, please open a new bug for that.

My only experience with git is as an annoyed end-user ;)
