DESCRIPTION:

Bug: Check for sign of bitwise operation involving 0x7ffffffc

(2147483644) in new
org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.internal.builder.ReferenceExtractor(IApiType,
Set, int)

This method compares a bitwise expression such as ((val & CONSTANT) > 0)
where CONSTANT is the negative number. Using bit arithmetic and then
comparing with the greater than operator can lead to unexpected results.
This comparison is unlikely to work as expected. The good practice is to
use '!= 0' instead of '> 0'.

Rank: Scary (5), confidence: High
Pattern: BIT_SIGNED_CHECK_HIGH_BIT
Type: BIT, Category: CORRECTNESS (Correctness)

This is an interesting finding. I think your change is valid, but there are a lot of other locations using the same pattern.

I have performed a search with the following regexp on the code base (343 matches in my code base):
  \(.* & .*\)\s*>\s*0

I assume that we don't have actually a bug with that, this would have been detected earlier. But it is always good to define a best-practice coding pattern and follow that concisely.

Would you be so kind and open a bug report describing the issue (the commit text is a good base) and refer to that bug in the commit message? We may need an umbrella bug for that and one bug per project referring to it, so that we could raise patches for each.
