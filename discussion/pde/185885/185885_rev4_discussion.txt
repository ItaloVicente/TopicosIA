Thanks for adding him.

Vikas do you know if this new approach works during I-builds? At least it is used in other cases that work and using FileLocator.toFileURL() should make sure that the returned URL is a file URL and extracts it to a temp file if necessary. On the other hand we are referring to a folder whose entire content is relevant in this case. So would it be necessary to extract the entire content into a temp-directory if it were packed into a jar file.

Looks sensible to me, let's try it.

Can we merge test changes now or do we have to wait for master to open?

Lets wait for master to open ( even if we have changes only in test plugin).

I had another look at the "org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests" plug-in and I think extracting the resources is not necessary because that plug-in has a "Eclipse-BundleShape: dir" specified in its Manifest.MF. Therefore it should be extracted by the runtime already, in case it is installed.

The master branch is open now, isn't it?
