DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576736 - enable RUN_API_ANALYSIS_AS_JOB by default

Note: the API tests rely on immediate API builder results after the
build, so easiest way for now is not to add "wait for build" each and
every time test triggers a build, but to switch the "run as job" to
false for API builder.

I think I build uses previous stable I build's API tools to run API analysis. So we probably need to wait for new I build to be sure.

Vikas, the preference was already set to false on ApiAnalysisApplication - which should be the one we use for API check.

When is the plan to enable it?

Vikas, personally I don't think it is needed, because for the headless build the job execution of builder doesn't make much sense - it is all sequential anyway, so starting API builder a job will not change much, except we need to wait few milliseconds longer.
