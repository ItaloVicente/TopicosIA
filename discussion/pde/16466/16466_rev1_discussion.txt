DESCRIPTION:

[355310] Add border to 'Use' Combo on extension point schema attribute
page.

This bug fix is in two parts - first, make sure that the toolkit is
painting the borders for the two sub-composites in the 'Use' section.

Second, modify the borders of those composites to add a little more room
around them, because this is where the border is painted - see the
Javadoc of
org.eclipse.ui.forms.widgets.FormToolkit.paintBordersFor(Composite),
which says "Care should be taken when selection layout margins. At least
one pixel margin width and height must be chosen to allow the toolkit to
paint the border on the parent around the widgets." In the main, most of
the elements in this form don't have any additional margin but it
doesn't matter because they're not closely packed in a composite. Note
that this solution makes the right-hand end of the Use combo one pixel
short of lining up with the rest of the elements. However, this is less
destructive than changing all the other elements' helper methods, etc.

The shorter combo is not good and can be noticed.

The commit comment should be changed as mentioned in the other change. Also, we usually write the technical details into the bug report and avoid lengthy commit messages.

Re: "The commit comment should be changed as mentioned in the other change. Also, we usually write the technical details into the bug report and avoid lengthy commit messages."
Great. It would be good if all this stuff was written down somewhere, as it's a real turn-off to contributors to find out this supposed best practice through incremental reviews once changes have been pushed.

"The shorter combo is not good and can be noticed."
Bear in mind that, prior to the fix, on Ubuntu, the problem is glaringly obvious and ugly. I'm afraid that I doubt I will have time to go about it the longer way. Perhaps my debug from the commit message will help someone else to fix it.

There is a contributor guide [1], but unfortunately it is not up-to-date regarding Gerrit, which PDE start to use only a few weeks back. See

Yeah, I'd seen that, and noticed it was still using CVS. I've given it a quick spruce-up to deal with Git and Gerrit instead, and show a sample commit message. It's still got info about using *.psf files to load - I can't find them anywhere, so not sure if that still applies. I've also said to use a patch in the bug report or Git, if you're still flexible to using patches, and I've left everything about the IP process. These sections may need altering to deal with the new workflow too.
