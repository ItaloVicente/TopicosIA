DESCRIPTION:

Bug 563755 - Poc for performance gain using optimized xml files

Compare the tests of

OpenManifestEditorPerf2Test
OpenManifestEditorPerfTest

I see 15 instead of 16 seconds in test "testEditorOpenXML"

The optimized plugin.xml has 201 kb. The original one has 253 kb.
Regarding the usage in eclipse they are equal. The reason that the
optimized one is smaller is that it uses self-close tags where possible
and tabs instead of spaces to format.

Hi Alex,
this one shows the advantage of optimizing xml files regarding performance reading it.
I did not add self-close tags whereever possible but in enough cases to show the impact on performance. The unchanged "plugin.xml" file you find in "org.eclipse.jdt.ui" folder.
Of course performance gain is small and in case of bundle activation other tasks predominates cpu load  but as it does not require any coding changes and therefore risk is low I still think it is a good idea to somewhat reformat all plugin.xml files. At least exchanging spaces with tabs comes with no price at all and has only advantages.

There are a few places where you can skip close tags; the <objectClass>...</objectClass> ones are one such example, and there are similar cases elsewhere. If you’ve changed the formatting where you’ve replaced <a></a> with <a/> but not for when you have <a>[whitespace]</a>, then you can do that as well.

It might be better if we think this is a good idea is to change the writer that generates the plugin.xml files, so that when it saves them, it automatically applies the transformation to strip empty elements. I don’t know how easy that would be though; there’s a lot of hand-coded XML generation.

As a side note, I tried writing these without spaces to improve parse time but broke a number of assumptions about how people process these files textually, so take that as a word of caution ...

Yes, I can add it to a writer but the question is how to apply it to a plugin. Maybe a Quickfix should be in charge of that. Or when I close the editor as kind of save action. Not sure..

Do you plan enhancing editors to optimize whitespace and selfclosing tags?

Currently I have no idea how to go on. First I created a number of gerrits to reduce the number of bugs in the schema files to be able to implement a validating schema chevking modification on the files. It has been rejected because of missing improvement on the end user side (reducing errors in the Schema compliance obviously do not count)
Then I optimized some xml files directly by removing unneccesarry whitespaces and removed explict end tags where possible. This should improve performance by reduced size. 
I was told that I first have to prove performance improvement resulting of this change is there. This is what this gerrit provides.
I tend to think it is time to abandon and give up any improvement in this area. 
For the editor implementation I do not know where to hook in the stylesheet processing needed to do the fixes automatically. I might be able to implement a quickfix but there are some needed steps (how to get the xml files to be processed) that are undocumented on jdt side and need time to be implemented. And after all it is not clear if this would be seen as worth to be merged at all.
Maybe I pick this up at a later point in time.

Thanks for trying Carsten. In the case where we change xml files but not editors to produce these changes we will see these changes overwritten next time someone uses the form editor which is not wanted. This meand hooking into multiple editors so I definitely see it becoming too much to handle.
The improvements seem nice but we need systematic approach here as otherwise these optimizations will get lost over time.
