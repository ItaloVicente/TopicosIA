I'm not sure about the addition of ProductModelManager.

So far, PDE didn't anything like it. If the Feature View is the only usage, I would prefer that FeatureIndex manages it.

WDYT, both in terms of performance and maintenance?

I think I understand the concern :) My thoughts:

The functionality provided by ProductModelManager does seem to be required for this view to work nicely, so its existence is necessary I think. As the pre-existing PluginModelManager and FeatureModelManager perform similar roles, it makes sense to me for ProductModelManager to follow the same patterns.

I do think its responsibility is distinct from FeatureIndex and so worth keeping separate, but it could absolutely move into the Features view packages somewhere. In fact, this is how the original plugin was factored.

I'm not sure about your performance and maintenance question – perhaps I'm just not seeing any obvious alternative options? :)

Happy to take your call on this, of course!

Yes of course, that's what I meant.

my thoughts were to
1) avoid overhead of product model management when view is not open
2) have a simpler implementation that's just enough for the view

Currently you're only looking in the project root for product files, so I guess the impact will be negligible. Once we include subfolders, that probably changes.

I think an alternative implementation could limit relevant projects by checking the extension registry -> TargetPlatformHelper::getProductNameSet
A registry listener + resource listener on those projects should then be enough to keep it up-to-date.

Some comments unrelated to the product model management discussion.

The viewer model is becoming increasingly complex with the different pde.core model objects for (visually) the same thing (IFeatureModel, IFeatureChild, IProductFeature, ...).

I suggest to eagerly normalize everything in the content provider (e.g. it would return only IFeatureModel as children for a product/feature).

This should make the element comparer redundant, I believe. Same for toFeatureModel etc.
Line:19, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/support/FeatureAndProductInput.java -> how about FeatureViewInput?

Line:45, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/support/ProductSupport.java -> I guess that'a a copy-paste mistake. The product editor only supports local resources AFAIK.

Line:41, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/viewer/FeatureChildViewerFilter.java -> I would split that up, it's a bit hard to read.

if (includedInFeature) return false;
if (showProducts && includedInProduct) return false;

Line:36, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/viewer/FeatureTreeCalleesContentProvider.java -> this should also return the product's plugins (when includePlugins is active).

To avoid cluttering the content provider, I suggest to extract the includePlugins handling into a ViewerFilter

Ok, thanks Julian - that's really helpful. I'll look into those things when I get the chance!

Hi Julian, I've just been having a look at what's involved in the more significant suggested changes :) My thoughts:

1) Sounds good – I'll make sure that's a part of whatever solution we end up with.
2) I might not be understanding this right, but I don't think the list of product-names from the extension registry would help us find the product configuration files (as they needn't be in the same project as their corresponding extensions), would it?

I agree that normalization could be nicer at the moment, though it might be a bit of a trade-off once refactoring support comes along. When that is included, the context of a selected item in the view becomes important (e.g. if the user deletes a selected feature we need to know what parent feature/product it's being deleted from or whether the feature itself should be deleted). Sure, that information is available from the TreeSelection, but won't we basically end up trying to restore the information lost during the IFeatureModel normalization process?

You're right.

We should still search for products below the project root though (probably with an IResourceProxyVisitor).

Also correct ;) Let's re-check this after refactoring support is included.

Hi Julian, this Gerrit change has now become 4 separate ones:

1. The minor PDE WorkspaceModelManager fix that was previously included here but should probably have been separate
2. This change
3. Introduction of ViewerFilters for show-plugins/products (separate as a reasonable-sized refactor)
4. Robustness improvement after seeing NPEs for IProductModels with null versions when testing

Changes 2 and 3 should address all of your comments, namely:
* Tying the ProductModelManager lifecycle to the Features view and not adding it to org.eclipse.pde.core
* Including non-project-root .product files
* Renaming the FeatureAndProductInput class
* Showing product plugins
* Refactoring plugin (and product) inclusion into ViewerFilters
* Some minor comments
