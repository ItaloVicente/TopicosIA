Performance looks great =)

Re *Support consistency: How about a common

   IXXXSupport {
     IModel toModel(Object)
     boolean open(Object)
     default void dispose() {}
   }

Then you could create a CompositeSupport which iterates over all three, simplifying all callers.

On an unrelated note: Please try to avoid relation chains across multiple bugs if at all possible. It's hard to distinguish the different changes in the diffs after a rebase.
Line:322, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/PDELabelProvider.java -> We have products without an ID in the workspace, we could fallback to the name instead of an empty string.

Line:46, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/support/FeatureSupport.java -> I don't like this pattern at all. Pointless code only for the sake of consistency is not worth it.
If they had a common interface, fine - but not like this.

Sorry, it's because I implemented the product support before the background-thread bug was raised, and I thought the bug was important to address first as soon as I had time. So they were unavoidably linked :(

I kind of want a hybrid-diff mode in Gerrit where it shows you only files/hunks changed between two particular patchsets, but diffed against the base!

Line:46, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/support/FeatureSupport.java -> Removed – I agree. Just trying to do the least surprising thing, and not quite managing :-p
