Some initial comments, I'll have to review and test this further next week.

Thanks for your work so far!
Line:31, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/model/WorkspaceProductModelManager.java -> I'll have to check how this performs on my large workspace next week.

Line:36, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/model/WorkspaceProductModelManager.java -> Is this correct? When deleting a product, I would assume that this reports the parent as not interesting and we never see the file delta.

Line:32, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/support/ProductSupport.java -> I don't like this static state. The manager instance should be held in FeaturesView and then passed to ProductSupport.

Line:39, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/viewer/FeatureTreeCallersContentProvider.java -> the toArray here is unnecessary

Line:31, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/model/WorkspaceProductModelManager.java -> Thanks.

Line:36, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/model/WorkspaceProductModelManager.java -> Very good spot! Fixed.

Line:32, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/support/ProductSupport.java -> Me neither, but it was a compromise to avoid a more significant refactor. The refactoring I've now done I've kept as a separate commit locally, so if you don't like it it's easy to revert that part of the change, or rework it :) See what you think – it's not quite what you suggested as I wanted to keep the *Support classes consistent with each other.

Line:39, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/viewer/FeatureTreeCallersContentProvider.java -> Oh yes, that was silly.

Comments addressed. RE the IXXXSupport suggestion, which I like: I'd rather defer further non-vital refactoring until all of the functionality is in, so it can all be taken into consideration – hope that's ok.
Line:31, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/model/WorkspaceProductModelManager.java -> Excellent.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:31, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/model/WorkspaceProductModelManager.java -> On my gigantic workspace with >1500 bundles the product indexing is barely noticeable in a sample. Nice!
