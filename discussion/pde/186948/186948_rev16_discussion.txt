DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576890 - Ignore elements not matching target-env in feature-launches

For feature-based launches the included features/plug-ins are ignored if
the including element specifies an environment that does not match the
environment specified by the current target-platform (or as fall-back by
the running-platform).

The environment specified for a feature itself is considered in the same
way, for included and required features.
