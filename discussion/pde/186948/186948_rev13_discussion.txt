DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576890 - Ignore elements not matching target-env in feature-launches

For feature-based launches the included features/plug-ins are ignored if
the including element specifies an environment that does not match the
environment specified by the current target-platform (or as fall-back by
the running-platform).

The environment specified for a feature itself is considered in the same
way, for included and required features.

> Could you add a bit more to the commit message body? For example this seems to work "only" for features and not plug-in based launch configurations and it would be nice to have this included in the commit message.

Yes of course. The previous message was indeed a bit short and I had to squash the head-line to fit the character limit. Is the new message better?
