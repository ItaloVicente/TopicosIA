DESCRIPTION:

Bug 567552 - supply missing JUnit 5 plugins from host

Extended launch mechanism for JUnit 5 runtime plugins:
- add jdt.junit5.runtime plugin for JUnit 5 launches
- add required plugins for JUnitPlatform runner
- transitively add their dependencies with support for incomplete
  target platforms

Effectively this now supports running tests against a target platform
containing only org.junit.jupiter.api.

Line:421, ui/org.eclipse.pde.unittest.junit/src/org/eclipse/pde/unittest/junit/launcher/JUnitPluginLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> I think this code can be refactored to only have a single call to DependencyManager::findRequirementsClosure since that method can also operate on BundleDescriptions from different containers (like TP and host) and I expect it to return the  requirements in each container (so there could a requirement from the host and the TP with the same Id and even same version).

I would like to clarify if only the required bundles of the JUnit-requirements (i.e. of requiredPlugins) or of all participating bundles should be added? The current code only adds requirements of JUnit-requirements.

But wouldn't that create a Set of two distinct requirement closures since the two containers are not wired together? Also you would break the case below right? (unless the unresolved bundle is a root).
What I tried to implement here is basically a findRequirementsClosure based on a merged state.


> The current code only adds requirements of JUnit-requirements.
That's correct. The target platform is responsible to provide all requirements of the test. The IDE (i.e. this code) is only responsible for the test infrastructure (i.e. bundles that eclipse itself needs like the junit.runtime bundles).

Also you would break the case below right? (unless the unresolved bundle is a root).
While finding the requirements closure, yes it would create two distinct sub-sets but they would be then merged together.

> What I tried to implement here is basically a findRequirementsClosure based on a merged state.

That's the right thing to do, but I think the my latest patch-set would be equivalent but only with a single invocation of  DependencyManager.findRequirementsClosure().
Since this could find many plug-ins (could be ~100 or more, but it depends) in each call I think should not call it in a loop.
The current patch-set would have to be polished to avoid code-duplications but that is the direction I think about.

What do you think?


> That's correct. The target platform is responsible to provide all requirements of the test. The IDE (i.e. this code) is only responsible for the test infrastructure (i.e. bundles that eclipse itself needs like the junit.runtime bundles).

That makes sense.

But I have no strong opinion if one way is clearly better than the other one. Both can be wanted depending on the situation. In general I think taking bundles from the host can also have its pitfalls when it comes to different versions. So both is not ideal IMHO, but necessary.

Then to answer my question: it's necessary for the current tests, because their target platform excludes o.j.platform.launcher which is required e.g. by o.j.platform.runner (from target).
Since findRequirementsClosure doesn't work for unresolved bundles I picked the one from the host instead.
