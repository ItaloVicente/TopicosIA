Line:77, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/AbstractLaunchTest.java -> why should the current project be kept?

Line:40, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/FeatureBasedLaunchTest.java -> why? that slows down the test unnecessarily

Line:60, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/util/TargetPlatformUtil.java -> what's the benefit of this IMHO more complicated implementation?

Line:84, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/util/TargetPlatformUtil.java -> AFAICS this method is not used outside of DependencyManagerTest (even with the later gerrits). So why move it?

I applied your suggestions and found a few more location where the TargetPlatformUtil could be reused.
Line:77, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/AbstractLaunchTest.java -> It shouldn't. I falsely had in my mind that the project was created before-class.

Line:40, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/launcher/FeatureBasedLaunchTest.java -> That's right. But it was necessary because in AbstractLaunchTest all projects where deleted before each test case.
Nevertheless I made AbstractLaunchTest more precise to delete after each test-case only those projects that where created in that case and in after-class those tests that where created before-class in sub-classes.
With that change this method can remain static/before-class and the LaunchConfigurationMigrationTest.setupPluginProjects() can be made static as well.

Line:60, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/util/TargetPlatformUtil.java -> The benefit is that possible other LoadTargetDefinitionJob's are canceled.
If you prefer the old implementation, I will revert it.

Line:84, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/util/TargetPlatformUtil.java -> That's right.
Initially when creating the PluginBasedLaunchTest in the subsequent Gerrit, I assumed I would use it, but I eventually chose another solution. Nevertheless I thought the code would fit better since it is quite generic and future test cases might use it. But I assume you prefer to keep it at DependencyManagerTest until there is a real use-case.

However after looking again at DependencyManagerTest, instead of creating a separate PDEState actually the target-platform simply can be loaded (and reset to the initial one after the test, like in the other test-classes). This avoids the method resolvePDEState() and just this method is specific enough to just keep it in DependencyManagerTest.

Line:60, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/util/TargetPlatformUtil.java -> have you observed other parallel job instances here?

If you want to keep this variant (your decision), I would replace result + latch with a single CompletableFuture

Line:60, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/tests/util/TargetPlatformUtil.java -> No I didn't.
The CompletableFuture is a good suggestion, however it requires either more thrown Exceptions or local handling, which would make it again more changes.
-> Reverted it to the previous approach.
