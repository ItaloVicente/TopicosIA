Wim, can you review the patch and check if there are other inconsistent messages in this file? I believe the style you proposed is correct (period, plug-in lowercase). Most New... wizards have a message like that.

According to the style guide it looks like all of this must be title case.

Guideline 1.5

Use Headline style capitalization for menus, tooltip and all titles, including those used for windows, dialogs, tabs, column headings and push buttons. Capitalize the first and last words, and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs.  Do not include ending punctuation.

I disagree. These texts are not used i the *title* of a dialog. The *title* of the wizard dialog is "New Project". These texts are displaye in the "text area"
See https://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-UI-Guidelines/Contents.html#Wizards . It says: "The text area is used to prompt the user for information which is absent, and display error messages if information is invalid. "

The text here give instructions to the user and this is sentence style.

The only question for me is: Is "Plug-in" a name like "Java" or "Maven" ...? If it is, we have to write "Plug-in" if not it has to be "plug-in".

+1 The description should be sentence style (I thought you had agreed on that Wim?).

Plug-in, project, feature, etc. are not names IMHO.

Please note that according to the spec the things that you have changed are title case and not sentence case. So it basically should stay as it was IMHO.

Why do you think the wizard descriptions are titles?
