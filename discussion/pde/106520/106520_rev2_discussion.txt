DESCRIPTION:

Bug 477578 - PDE activator slows down startup of Eclipse
Bug 477578: PDE activator slows down startup of Eclipse The contribution
to the org.eclipse.ui.services extension point had the effect that the
PDE bundle (and all it's dependencies) where activated already at start
up of the platform. In use-cases where PDE is installed but not used
(e.g. because one does pure Java development) this is not necessary. As
all the bundle activation happens sequentially in the UI thread this
directly adds up to the start up time during which the user sees the
splash screen. The ImageBrowserView no longer uses a service to
communicate the selected image to the SaveToWorkspace command handler.
As the view and the command handler are anyway hardly coupled the
decoupling via a service does not bring any advantages but only bring
the performance penalty at start up.
