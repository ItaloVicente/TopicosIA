Scenarios from Bug 532264:

working:
- transitive dependency from o.e.core.commands to o.e.osgi
- transitive dependency from o.e.core.filebuffers to o.e.core.variables

not working:
- generic requirement (BREE) from o.e.equinox.launcher to o.e.osgi

The last one is by design, as the generic requirement is not relevant for the build order - only at runtime.
API Tools needs to be updated, to also only check the transitive build dependencies.

@Julian: did you manage to capture steps to reproduce for this one? Anything you could automate in a test case?

> @Julian: did you manage to capture steps to reproduce for this one? Anything you could automate in a test case?

For reproduction the host, test-fragment, testframework (which depends on host) scenario should work.
Another case is as follows:
- bundle A declares a service interface SI and a require-capability for X
- bundle B implements SI and provides-capability X

The obvious build-dependency is from B to A, but the OSGi state has one in reverse as well.

Primary issue is that while the build order graph has cycles=true, it seems to still be able to compute a working build order for me. I.e. outside the debugger, there's no indication whatsoever.

Both cases should be straight-forward to include as test case, but I'm not sure how to verify the cycle-free graph.

Ideas?

Indeed, there is a fail-back implementation in case of cycles to attemps make things work, and often succeed.

So even with the cycle, you don't get the error described in the bug? Do you know what's the criterion to get the error or not? Is there anything in the log we could monitor?

Exactly, on my machine all small examples as well as the large affected workspace build error-free. I haven't figured out why so far.
Log doesn't show anything obvious IIRC.

Any pointers where I could look are welcome, but I won't get a chance before Wednesday.
