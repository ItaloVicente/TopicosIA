DESCRIPTION:

Bug 441659: Image Browser does not advance on "Show more" 

- this button (Show More) does not actually do anything but refresh,
the naming does not reflect the behavior. The refresh on 
its own is not needed since it can be triggered by changing other
fields, the only fields that does not refresh automatically was maximum
images field, so I added listener to trigger refresh on that
and remove Show More button
- if intention was to provide pagination it is not implemented at
all in the code and having one button for this is pretty weird. The
modern UI approach is to use filtering and search instead of scrolling
and pagination (separate patch is to add icons path filter to reduce the
number of icons). Even if we want to implement pagination it should be
another spinner with page number not a single button. In any case this
button should be removed IMHO
