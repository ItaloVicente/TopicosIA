File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> It's not yet clear how this flag will be consumed by P2/tycho, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=570760#c20

This change should not be merged before that. (-1 to be save)

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> This should not be tied to any consumer of the product file.
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I don't think this is related. Just to be clear P2/Tycho will only follow PDE here but not take the lead.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Just for reference P2 added over ten years ago an option to use a "mixed" mode, PDE never implemented that making it impossible to use that beside some manual crafted product files:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=325622

Thus it should always be PDE first, P2/Tycho second for such improvements.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> I agree that PDE should take the lead here, however I understand that we should first have some confidence that there will be consumers. Because for PDE itself it is actually only relevant for launching the product.
And I will re-create this on GitHub right after the move. :)
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> That's a very nice feature! And to confirm your point: I didn't know P2 offers this. Just a few days ago I thought that it would be handy to be able to add Features and Plug-ins when I created a feature just to add the branding plug-in to a product (similar to what EPP does).

Is there already a Bug to implement this in PDE? If not do you want to create one (in GH tomorrow or in Bugzilla?)?
I have not yet looked into the details but this should not be difficult to implement in PDE. To launch such a product a feature-based launch could be used where all plug-ins are added as additional plug-ins. The main work will likely be to adjust the UI accordingly.

File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> Don't know, the Bugzilla tracker is horrible to search for things (just an opinion...).
File Comment: /PATCHSET_LEVEL -> PDE is the consumer. If I create a product and check it into my code repository I don't like to tell the user he should set something in his launch config before launching the product ... This is an important part of the configuration and should be persisted.
