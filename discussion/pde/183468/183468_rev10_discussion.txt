DESCRIPTION:

Bug 539637 - Major rework of dependency computation in DependencyManager

- consider version of dependencies and return Sets of BundleDescriptions
instead of only bundle id/symbolic-name strings. This way multiple
versions of the same bundle are considered.

+ Implement the dependency computation based on an exhaustive
Breadth-first search to compute the self contained closure of all
required bundle-wires of an initially given set of plug-in models.

 - simpler algorithm (more abstract, thus less cases to consider)
 - improved runtime behavior, to be linear to the number of
   requirements and wires in the resulting closure. The later is likely
   to be dominating. Assuming all called methods have constant time.

+ (internal) API is changed to be collection based
+ returned Set is NOT sorted anymore

Great. I applied your change requests and unified the imports of the projects using a utility-method.
Furthermore I fixed a race-condition that occurred when I executed the tests locally (see comment in the Test-class).
Line:30, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui.tests/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/tests/internal/DependencyManagerTest.java -> I just added this to ensure that the PluginModelManager is initialized because when I run all tests in the IDE as Plug-in Tests I got an NPE in the first test case because PluginRegistry.findModel(project) returned null.
But when I stepped through the code with the debugger everything went fine. So I think there is a race-condition here and I assume that this fixes it (at least for me it worked).

Unless there are major change-request, it would be great if we could merge this change until tomorrow (mondey) to not miss the first milestone of the next release and have a full release-cycle for testing available.
Sorry for the rush now, but I didn't expect M1 so early after the last release.

Sure! Please remove the TODO comments though (the current behavior is OK - for this change at least).
