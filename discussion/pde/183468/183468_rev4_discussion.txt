DESCRIPTION:

Bug 539637 - Major rework of dependency computation in DependencyManager

- consider version of dependencies and return Sets of BundleDescriptions
instead of only bundle id/symbolic-name strings. This way multiple
versions of the same bundle are considered.

+ Implement the dependency computation based on an exhaustive
Breadth-first search to compute the self contained closure of all
required wires of an initially given set of plug-in models.

 - simpler algorithm (more abstract, thus less cases to consider)
 - improved runtime behavior, to be linear to the number of
   requirements and wires. The later is likely to be dominating. Assumes
   all called methods have constant time.

+ (internal) API is changed to be collection based
+ returned Set is NOT sorted anymore

Some minor issues, but less code with more functionality is great!

We really need to invest in some regression tests for the dependency calculation though.
If you want to write them, you could look at DynamicPluginProjectReferencesTest for inspiration. If not, just let me know and I'll take take of that.
Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> where exactly do you expect improved performance? I would have expected the old implementation to perform similarly

Line:643, apitools/org.eclipse.pde.api.tools/src/org/eclipse/pde/api/tools/internal/ApiBaselineManager.java -> I don't think so

Line:126, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> excludedFragments was not nullable before, so we don't need to handle that. Also to avoid the copy we could directly the paramter to be a Set

Line:130, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> I'm not a fan of this behavior toggle. I would remove the parameter, rename this method to getSelfAndDependencies and do the remove in the two getDependencies methods instead. WDYT?

Line:161, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> according to the documentation of getBundle you should pass a null version if unspecified, this would pass 0.0.0 instead

Line:174, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> since this method handles plugins and implicit the same, this method could accept a single Set<BundleDescription> parameter and the caller should merge both collections

Line:184, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> could be simplified to findEntry(bundle) right?

Line:356, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/editor/product/PluginSection.java -> emptySet instead of null for excludedFragments

Line:363, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/editor/product/PluginSection.java -> since add plugin doesn't set a version (even if the selected plugin is available in multiple versions) this should also leave it empty.

I already had the same thoughts and fully agree. I can write tests for it. Thanks for the hint.


The first set of replies on your remarks, the remaining will follow as soon as possible.
Line:126, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> That's right. Nevertheless I think it is not consistent, if the first public methods accept null for excludedFragments and the last one does not.

However all callers pass null or an empty Set for excludedFragments, so it is effectively never used. Therefore I suggest to remove it. At least for the convenient public methods. But actually the excludedFragments feature could be fully removed or are some other Eclipse projects using this internals?

Line:130, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> Fully agree on that.
What do you think about the name getDependencyClosure()? I would prefer it over a method name containing 'and'.

Line:161, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> Done. Thanks for that hint.

Line:174, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> Agree on that.
I would even go one step further and also merge those arguments in the calling method.
So the convenient methods merge the plugins and implicit before calling the 'last' public getDependencies/getDependencyClosure method. This way the number of arguments is reduced further and the getRequirementClosure method could be inlined into the caller, since removing the plug-ins again is also moved 'upwards'.
The callers from other packages (and formerly used the DependencyCalculator) also pass an empty set as implicit anyways.

Line:356, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/editor/product/PluginSection.java -> Done

Line:126, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> you're right, it's never used. Since DependencyManager is not API, we can simply remove it.

Line:130, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> State::getDependencyClosure returns the opposite though, right? It collects self + *dependents*.
TBH I'm always confused by that name, so lets stick with getSelfAndDependencies

Line:174, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> sounds good

Support for generic capabilites is only added by this change so that should not be faster than not doing at all? ;)

of the product validation?

Yes, but only once when an Eclipse-App is started with automatic validation enabled. The old algorithm used a BundleValidationOperation to satisfy generic-requirements (in 'getDependencies(State, IPluginModelBase[])' in the previous version) and it could happen that this operation was executed multiple times in case new plug-ins are added.

Actually Bug 522332 aimed to add support for generic requirements/capabilities. But at least from my benchmark example I suspect that it was not 100% reliable. But this new version should be accurate.

No, of 'Add Required Plug-ins' in the 'Plug-ins' tab of the Run-Configuration window.

Line:18, /COMMIT_MSG -> I expect performance improvements mainly from
+ avoiding to resolve a full State in the BundleValidationOperation in each add-dependencies-iteration (which I assume is an operation with a runtime that is at least linear to the number of elements in the state).
+ finding the provider of a generic required capability in a de-facto constant time operation, which was done before by iterating over all dependency-bundles or even all bundles in the passed TP state (so of linear runtime).

Of course the over all runtime and runtime behavior and the difference to the implementation before dependents of the degree of completeness of the given set of plug-ins and how many required generic capabilities they define.

I did a really basic measurement (only a single pass, time measured with System.currentTimeMillis()) of the runtime for a basic Eclipse SDK based product which was almost complete and it gave me an runtime improvement somewhere between factor 5 to 10. But those numbers are very vague and also can vary on the exact scenario.

Line:130, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> Exactly (that was also the method that gave me the idea for the new wiring based approach).
IMHO the name does not perfectly fit, not because of the 'closure' but because it uses 'dependencies' from which I would expect the opposite of what it is actually doing.
Alternatively we could use 'getRequirementClosure()'.

However 'getSelfAndDependencies()' is also fine.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:184, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/BundleLauncherHelper.java -> This was also my first thought, but the findModel() method could have a different precedence between workspace and external bundles compared to the workspace/external precedence of the workspace state.

If workspace or external bundles are preferred is specified in 'location' argument of findModel(). So if a bundle with the same symbolic name and the same or a (slight) different version exists in the TP and the workspace the launch's precedence could be different to the precedence of the resolver that establishes the wires (I don't know if it is possible to specify a precedence for the resolver). This could lead to unexpected behavior.

However having another workspace/external precedence than the resolver here is actually not exact because different variants of the same bundle with the same version in the workspace and in the TP could have different requirements and capabilities. This would of course be a design smell but as for as I know nothing forces you to have different versions if bundles are not identical (unless you have the API tools activated).

So I think this could be a general issue (a detail that probably doesn't matter in 99% of the cases), but if it is addressed it should be addressed in a separate bug/change.

I assume that if no version is specified, the latest one is used?

Nevertheless because I would expect that 'add required plug-ins' makes the product fully valid I suggest to add a version all but the latest required versions in case multiple versions are required for the product.
Maybe this should also be addressed in another bug/change?
WDYT?
