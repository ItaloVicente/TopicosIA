DESCRIPTION:

Bug 539637 - Major rework of dependency computation in DependencyManager

- consider version of dependencies and return Sets of BundleDescriptions
instead of only bundle id/symbolic-name strings. This way multiple
versions of the same bundle are considered.

+ Implement the dependency computation based on an exhaustive
Breadth-first search to compute the self contained closure of all
required wires of an initially given set of plug-in models.

 - simpler algorithm (more abstract, thus less cases to consider)
 - improved runtime behavior, to be linear to the number of
   requirements and wires. The later is likely to be dominating. Assumes
   all called methods have constant time.

+ (internal) API is changed to be collection based
+ returned Set is NOT sorted anymore

I implemented your remarks and adjusted the java-doc.

What is still missing are the tests.

Furthermore I think we should rename the getSelfAndDependencies(Set<BundleDescription>, boolean) method to distinguish it from the other more convenient methods that add implicit dependencies from the target-platform.

I suggest something like getRequirementClosure() which is different and more precise than State.getDependencyClosure().

I just wanted to let you know that I started to write tests for 'DependencyManager'. I'm on vacation most for the next five/six days but I think I can complete the test until the end of the up-commong week/the beginning of the following week.

Thanks for working on this.
Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> I doubt its linear to the number of required wires as you have nested requiredWires in "while (!pending.isEmpty())".

Anyway - If its faster its good :-)
Can you please provide an example timing how long it takes for many (~1000) plugins (before/after)?

Line:19, /COMMIT_MSG -> The DependencyManager performs an exhaustive breadth-first-search over all required wires in the requirements closure (not only of the initial set). An BFS has a runtime complexity of O(|V|+|E|), regarding all encountered vertices and edges. In this case the vertices are the bundles and the edges the wires and a exhaustive BFS is performed, so all bundles and wires in the closure are checked. Because there are likely more wires than bundles the runtime is linear to the number of wires in the entire closure, not only the initial set or similar. But I will make the commit message more precise.

I have build an example that I will attach to the bugzilla. It only contains 469 plug-ins but I don't directly more features that add many bundles. If you know some more large features, I'd happily update the example.
I prepared a launch config where I added only the leaf plug-ins (that do not provide any wires) so that a maximal number of plug-ins are searched/found.

To benchmark it, I measured the runtime of the call to the DependencyManager inside AbstractPluginBlock.addRequiredPlugins() using System.currentTimeMillis(). Then I hit 'Add Required Plug-ins in the 'Plug-ins' tab of the 'Run Configuration' Window.
After I repeated it a few times, the current algorithm took about 15ms and the new one ~2ms.
For an already closed set of plug-ins the runtime of both algorithms is around 2ms.
I think this is because with the new algorithm in the end every required wire of each plug-in in the resulting closure is checked, regardless of if it initially given or discovered by the search. The longer runtime of the old algorithm for an incomplete set of bundles is probably because of the way generic capabilities are resolved (using a BundleValidationOperation)

A larger example would probably give clearer numbers, even though I expect the main difference from the way how generic-requirements/capabilities were handled.

Another difference between the old and the new algorithm is that the new one creates a closure that also passes the Validation (i.e. the validation still fails with only the org.apache.xerces but this is because the Target-Platform resolver fails to resolve this as well, which I suspect to be a Bug in the legacy Equinox OSGi Resolver). The old algorithm lead to many more validation errors. Some where clearly because of the not considered version, but some also seem to be missing because generic requirements still were not fully resolved.

Line:144, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/DependencyManager.java -> I think that is not exactly what this method is doing because IMHO prerequisites does not include the initially given set of plug-ins.

I'm strongly in favor of 'findRequirementsClosure()' because it describes quite precisely what this method is doing.
- find -- because this method performs a breadth-first-search and when you search you (hopefully) find :)
- requirements -- because this methods considers requirements 
- closure -- because the result contains the initially given set in conjunction with all found requirements. This term is also used in mathematics to describe a set of elements that is 'self-contained' under a certain operation and also in graph-thorie to describe the 'transitive closure' of a breadth-first-search (at least it is used in the wikipedia article of BFS).

Was I able to convince you?
