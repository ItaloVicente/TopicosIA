DESCRIPTION:

Bug 539637 - Major rework of dependency computation in DependencyManager

- consider version of dependencies and return Sets of BundleDescriptions
instead of only bundle id/symbolic-name strings. This way multiple
versions of the same bundle are considered.

+ Implement the dependency computation based on an exhaustive
Breadth-first search to compute the self contained closure of all
required bundle-wires of an initially given set of plug-in models.

 - simpler algorithm (more abstract, thus less cases to consider)
 - improved runtime behavior, to be linear to the number of
   requirements and wires in the resulting closure. The later is likely
   to be dominating. Assuming all called methods have constant time.

+ (internal) API is changed to be collection based
+ returned Set is NOT sorted anymore

First of all sorry the delay.

I have added tests for all cases that I think are relevant. If you think there are cases missing I'm happy to add them.

The long running mixed (integration) test took a bit longer, because I faced problems that the target-platform resolver fails to resolve all plug-ins without errors. This error is subtile because the TP does not fail to load but in the Target-Platform State view an error is displayed for the org.apache.xerces plug-in ("Missing Constraint: Import-Package: javax.xml.transform.stax").
I just noticed it in the tests because some BundleWirings were null were I didn't expect them and I got some NPEs. First I thought it was because I did not set up the test environment correctly but then I also found the errors in the (debugged) Eclipse-App.

From my point of view this change is complete now, unless you request changes.
