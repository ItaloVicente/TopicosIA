I think we should also add all letters. Why do you think it is too intrusive?

Code assist would pop up on practically every key stroke, which felt annoying to me and not like the rest of eclipse. JDT only has "." by default.

It felt weird to close a pop-up and having it reappear on the next character anyway.

IMHO the . only is an anti feature in Eclipse, IntellJ gives code completion on every keystroke. IIRC the only reason why we don't have that is that JDT code completion is currently done in the main thread.
