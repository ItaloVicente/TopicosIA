@Christoph do we have anything else to fix except CI?

I think this is good just a little idea, see comment.
Line:46, apitools/org.eclipse.pde.api.tools/src/org/eclipse/pde/api/tools/internal/BundleJarFiles.java -> I think this can be static with "File dependencies" as parameter.

But I'm trying to stop using "global procedures" and give OOP a chance 😊

And find a lot of pro-and-cons-and discussion 😊 I wish all these "you are wrong" blog post time would be invested in enhance open-source projects 😐

The class here is simply a wrapper around a file object and is in fact just a way to extract some code into another place (it could have been located in the Api Application without any drawback).

Following your argumentation you should immediately throw away all of the "Files" and "Optional" static references and replace them with "new" counterparts as they all follow the "bad" procedural style ... there are always pros-and-cons and I just made a suggestion so it's totally fine not to follow it so I think we are fine here 👍

nope, they are not 😊 static methods are global procedures and has nothing common with OOP. Code with static methods is a part of procedural programming, it just uses Java syntax.
You can have a look on this article that aggregates a lot of experience of others https://www.yegor256.com/2014/05/05/oop-alternative-to-utility-classes.html


> Object that do not use the state of its members in anyway is simply a waste of memory

I don't think so. Immutable objects have a lot of benefits: they makes code more simple, testable and supportable; they escapes from all the multu-thread problems by design. 
We reworked the whole Eclipse Passage core to be immutable and now it is much more stable and predictable on complex use cases.

And yes, OOP does create objects intensively. But, this is the problem that JVM should focus on. If JVM is unable to manage created objects effectively - we should better forbid "new" keyword.
In other words: if we are sure that "static" methods are more effective we should throw away all the short living objects from our code and use "static" everywhere. If we are sure that OOP approach works better we should get rid of procedural "static" code.

Right, and a lot of Platform code as well, as a foundation of Platform was designed 20 years ago with wide usage of global procedures and variables. Well, not really possible at the moment :)

For me "public static" is a road sign of the wrong design direction for a system that pretends to be dynamic [and pretends to follow OOP]. 
I was also very sceptic regarding all these chains of "new" instead of good old procedural code. But then I realized that I spent more time thinking about object contract and writing tests and less time debugging. Perhaps because all that stream-style code is not debuggable 😊
And I think this is good, because then you start to debug - this is a kind of engineering failure, a proof that you cannot understand the code in front of your eyes.

Thanks again for your review, Christoph!

Even though I don't think it maters much here, the only difference between

new BundleJarFiles(dependencyList).list()

and 

BundleJarFiles.list(dependencyList)

from an OOP of view is that an object is created and immediately thrown away, so nothing is gained here not using "static".

Line:52, apitools/org.eclipse.pde.api.tools/src/org/eclipse/pde/api/tools/internal/BundleJarFiles.java -> Alexander, just a thing I have overseen: We collect the stream to a list here just (at the call side) to transform this list into a stream. Maybe it would be better to to just return the stream here?
