DESCRIPTION:

Use switch rather than if/else if chain where possible

Change cascades of ifs which can be converted to switch. A switch
statement might be faster than an if-then-else chain. And it improves
clarity. Problem with if..else chain is that I have to look into all the
if conditions to understand what the program is doing. And the variable
might change in the chain processing.
