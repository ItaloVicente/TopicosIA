Julian,

I think this is good to go now. I've left the public API as is, and re-implemented its behaviour. We can merge and go ahead with the related changes and subsequently revisit the removal of this specific method and its dependent classes. WDYT?

I like the idea of temporarily duplicating the functionality in pde, but I can't reliably review the changes between the new helper and the original update.configurator code.

I would feel more comfortable if we either 
* add a test against an expected output file
* or copy the whole update.configurator code to pde

WDYT?

Copying the whole code isn't practical; there's a big fan-out in terms of content that would get dragged in, and it's unnecessary to bring in most of it since all this method does is write out an XML file based on the arguments passed in.

However, adding a test seems sensible to me. Will look at writing a test that we can merge first, then verifying it works against the new change set instead.
