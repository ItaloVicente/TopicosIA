DESCRIPTION:

Bug 297143 - Default to not generating an activator

The purpose of a Bundle-Activator is to run at start-up of a plug-in.
However this is rarely needed and it should default to not being created
by default; it's trivial to generate one if needed in any case.

Line:200, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/wizards/plugin/PluginContentPage.java -> Thanks for this small change.

Why is the boolean value negated here? I see it was the same in previous patch set, but this reversed logic is tricky to understand and error-prone. So the S_GENERATE_ACTIVATOR setting actually stores a "skip generate activator" value?
It would seem simpler to just pass "settings != null && Boolean.valueOf(settings.get(S_GENERATE_ACTIVATOR))". Even if the meaning of the flag was different before, it seems to be acceptable to change that.

Yes, the Boolean is reversed - it actualLu means "do not generate activator" if true. I created a minimal patch first of all but I'm happy to reword this to make more sense if you would be happy to approve a slightly bigger delta.

I'm not a PDE committer, so I cannot say what will be approved or not, but unless this symbol is API, renaming it to S_SKIP_GENERATE_ACTIVATOR seems to be a nice addition to that change.
Or you can just assume it means "generate activator" and stop negating the value. The only affected people would be those who already have this set in the dialog settings, that would see there setting reversed after an update. I imagine it's also an acceptable difference that wouldn't hurt too bad since it is easy to troubleshoot (it's easy to remove or add an activator after the fact).
