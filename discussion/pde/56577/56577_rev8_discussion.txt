DESCRIPTION:

Bug 297143 - Default to not generating an activator

The purpose of a Bundle-Activator is to run at start-up of a plug-in.
However this is rarely needed and it should default to not being created
by default; it's trivial to generate one if needed in any case.

From memory this does the wrong thing because I did a similar implementation last time. The difference is what the default is if the string is missing in the configuration. If there is no configuration then the settings.getBoolean() will return false (IIRC) which means that you can't tell the difference between someone who hasn't set this value and someone who has explicitly disabled the setting. In fact I think this will have the opposite behaviour in that skipGeneration will now explicitly be false and thus always generate it in the case of a missing value. At least that is the case if getBoolean returns a boolean (as opposed to a Boolean). That said if you've tested it and done all the cases (running with a clean workbench without Oomph modifying the setting behind your back, checking the default works of not set, it persists once you have set it etc.) then I'm happy to withdraw my -1
