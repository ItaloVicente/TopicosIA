DESCRIPTION:

Bug 297143 - Default to not generating an activator

The purpose of a Bundle-Activator is to run at start-up of a plug-in.
However this is rarely needed and it should default to not being created
by default; it's trivial to generate one if needed in any case.

What happens in the case where you're running against an older workspace where this field has already been set? Doesn't this invert the meaning of previously stored configuration? As much as I like the cleaned up code more I haven't thought about it sufficiently to know if that's an issue (or if it is, whether it's something we can live with). If we're going to invert the setting then we should probably use a different setting for the dialog, and then upgrade it from old to new on first run.

I don't think that is a really bad scenario. Creating a plug-in via the wizard or via the MANIFEST is super simple. And if they set it once, it will work again as before. 

But I definitely will add this to the N&N to inform people about the change.

In that case, why not just change the name of the setting so we don't inherit any previously saved state, and in the N&N say that people will have to manually enable it explicitly if they want to? Starting from a fresh state seems better than inheriting previous values (particularly if people have gone out of their way to turn it off; they'll be the ones most surprised when it comes back on again)
