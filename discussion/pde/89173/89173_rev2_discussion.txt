DESCRIPTION:

Bug 510698 - Version autocomplete improvements on generic target editor

Now if there is already a version for an installable unit it will
propose to replace the current one, rather than insert the new one.

Also minor bug fix relating to '0.0.0' default version.

Can you explain the versioning autocomplete improvement ? I am seeing similar behavior. May be I am missing something.

Thanks for the prompt review.

Find an installation unit with two or more available versions. One option is org.apache.lucene.core in orbit repo.

First use autocomplete as normal and pick a version. Then try to change it by triggering autocomplete at the start of the version string. 

Now: You'll see the autocomplete has "(replace)" and if you select it will replace version.

Before: It didn't care if the version was already there but it just inserted the autocomplete proposal.

It also plays well with prefix autocompletion (e.g. 2.2.4 and 2.2.6 and triggering AC after 2.2.) and different length proposals e.g. replace 2.1.0v20170101 with 0.0.0.

Feel free to ask more questions if I wasn't clear enough.

I see couple of issues
1) The user is told that "Started job fetching metadata. Retry when job is finished". However since  job.setUser(true); the user never knows when the job finishes and when he or she should retry.
2) Assuming user waits once he sees that information (getInformativeProposal), once the job is finished , the version proposals should be seen .

Right now it looks confusing according to me.

The two points you mentioned could be improved indeed. But the change in question tries to achieve better completion after you make a choice rather than changing the completion workflow. 

The behavior you described is the same with or without this patch. Thus I propose I file a bug with the above mentioned concerns and look at this issue separately as the improvements here are unrelated to that behavior.
