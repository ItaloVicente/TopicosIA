Patch Set 3: Code-Review+1

I have some minor remarks in the current implementation regarding the expected functionality. But I think they can be solved afterwards and should not block this contribution for now.

- field references show errors when bind/updated/unbind attributes are used with @Reference (incorrect but not blocking as it is not a major use case, so can be fixed afterwards)
- capabilities are not generated in the MANIFEST (missing but not blocking)
- default values are inserted in the XML for field references (e.g. cardinality="1..1") (cosmetics)
- field-collection-type="service" is not added to XML in case of service collection (cosmetics - probably because it is the default, it is generated for other collection types e.g. Collection<ServiceReferences<E>>)

The issues I have found and communicated directly to Peter before, that were blocking are fixed with the latest patch set.

From my side the current state is ok to get started with in M6. The polishing that needs to be done can be performed afterwards, as I don't think they are blocking.
