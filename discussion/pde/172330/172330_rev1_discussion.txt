+1 on the concept, a couple of minor remarks though.

We're past M3 and would need PMC approval for the API additions, do you mind waiting until 4.19?
Line:320, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> please demonstrate the new API by implementing it in PDE's target editors to replace this code.

Line:365, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> I wonder if the selection behavior needs or even can be controlled by the new api. If the wizard does replace the element, does it know the new element in advance? Probably not.

Line:376, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> I'm not happy about the double checked canEdit + null check, in the old code as well. How about dropping canEdit and having just an Optional<IWizard> getEditWizard?

Line:570, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> For canUpdate there's already API (ITargetLocationUpdater), it doesn't seem used here though.

You're working on a maven-based target editor right? So removal of elements seems helpful. Should we include that in the api as well?

Line:26, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationEditorExt.java -> following the common naming convention this should be ITargetLocationEditor2

Line:37, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationEditorExt.java -> how about TreePath instead of the array?

In general I'd like to get the new API asap of course so it can be used by the new maven-target editor as it would improve user experience and allows more fine control over configuration.
But if it is a lot of hassle I think we can delay this to the next release. Especially if some refactoring in existing code are desired it might be unrealistic to get this in right now, wdt?
Line:320, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> Do you think the whole ITargetLocation APi should be replaced or just the part that is used below with IUWrapper?

I think the old API can completely be rewritten (with adapters) in terms of the new one but that might be too much work for little gain.

Line:365, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> The current API/approach is a bit... at least confusing. Some parts are provided by the extension and the extension also updates locations in the target (but sometimes replace them) but the locationgroup is responsible for selection/ui handling/refreshing.

I'm just not sure how this could be improved without major refactoring (what might be undesirable but possible) as there are a lot of TODOs around and the code seems not to be actively developed for many years.

Line:376, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> As far as I have understand the old code, it is very defensive as the existing Editors are a mixture of different approaches.

"canEdit" is for example used when it comes to the point whether buttons should be enabled or not.

Line:570, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> Yes the ITargetLocationUpdater is also a bit vague as it seems to serve different purpose. I just tried to add as less as necessary for now but the reload vs update has often been a source of confusion especially with P2 sites.

Line:26, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationEditorExt.java -> Should it extend the old interface then? Or do you think it should be a replacement of the old one?

Line:37, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationEditorExt.java -> Whatever seems more suitable, I just thought it might be a good idea to decouple this from the actual implementation (e.g. if once upon a time this will no longer be a tree but some other kind of UI element).

BTW for the maven target part an include/exclude button for a selected item would also be useful but I think that's another story.

I strongly prefer waiting for 4.19 so we have a change to stabilize it.
Line:320, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> Oh right, the ITargetLocationEditor part should not change of course. The IUWrapper branch should be replaced though as it matches your API's usecase.

Line:365, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> Right. It might be enough to try and restore the previous selection and if that doesn't exist anymore select its parent.

Line:376, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> IMHO it's OK to ask for an edit wizard in updateButtons()

Line:570, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> minimal changes are fine, I just want to avoid an ITargetLocationEditor3 with a canRemove in the subsequent release ;)

Line:26, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationEditorExt.java -> Good question, it would be an extension to ITargetLocationEditor. Therefore ITargetLocationEditorExtension would be better - similar to IDocumentExtension etc.

Line:37, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationEditorExt.java -> If we want to offer a childElementPath and not just the leaf object, I would prefer TreePath. Decoupling from UI in general is not relevant for pde.ui and replacing the tree structure would break/affect this API anyway.

Alright then lets schedule it for 4.19.
Line:570, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> I see... as it seems to be delayed anyways by some month it might be worth to think about a bigger picture then, maybe instead of a boolean the method "canEdit" should return an integer that is a bit-field with flags of EDIT/DELETE/UPDATE/TOGGLE/<... can be extended later...>

The actual wizard method can then also take an integer getEditWizard(int, ...) that distinguish what kind of edit is desired.

Alternative would be to have an enum and for this.

Line:575, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> As we are talking about improvements here anyways, I must confess that in the past 10 years I'm using PDE i never have understand why the heck it is not possible to edit a location if there are resolution errors in the target.

Line:570, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> the remove implementation would not require a wizard, so that should stay separate.

Question is: Do you want to implement that API within 4.19 ;)

Line:575, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> Good question, no idea - that's quite counterintuitive...

Line:575, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> The usual reason to "why not" is usually that "it was too expensive to implement it from beginning, and no one had need to implement it later" ;)

Line:570, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> for remove: It depends, maybe some kind of "do you really like to destroy all your hard work" question or something :-)

Maybe it would be even better to drop of the whole Wizard story and simply have an "performAction", passing a shell + the selection and let the implementation decide what to do?
The only additional work would be that implementors need to create the wizzardialog and return whether the action was canceled or not and I found this pattern often the most flexible.

> Question is: Do you want to implement that API within 4.19 
The emoji might imply some kind of problem/implication that I currently not able to interpret,  do you mind to rephrase the question?

Line:575, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> Most likely IBM want's to punish developers that are not able to write correct targets at first place! :-)

Line:570, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> The goal would be to provide an API to replace what's done with IUWrapper in handleRemove().

One benefit of less flexible API is that implementations behave more or less the same, improving user experience. Therefore I would prefer the following API:

* Optional<IWizard> getEditWizard(...) or an additional canEdit/isEditable
* boolean canRemove(Object selection) or maybe isRemovable
* void remove(Object selection)

Line:570, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> But limiting to IWizard here is just, well limited. Its also unlikely that there will be much consumers for that API anyways to take too much effort in how it can be generalized.
I think it would be better to have a more generic flow than al these differentiation (what makes it even harder to implement, at the moment one must implement all these different interfaces and adapters, but essentially they all serve very similar purpose and would simplify the code flow here, because at least we would need a mean for update then also (even though it is ambiguous at least for me whats the real difference between update+reload)

Line:570, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> Limits are not necessarily bad. Just to take remove as an example: If the implementation were to open a dialog, we would currently do that in a loop. I think it's a good idea here to restrict that flexibility.

Not sure what you mean with similar purpose. Just Edit and Remove would be quite different implementation-wise.
