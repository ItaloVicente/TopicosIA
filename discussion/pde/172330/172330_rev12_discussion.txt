So everyone is fine with the changes? Or any further comments? Then this needs approval from a PDE committer.

Line:35, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetBundleAdapter.java -> When toggling 1000 bundles of one update site, the UI is blocked for 12s serializing the file after each bundle.

Can we replace the adapter with a singleton and pull the NameVersionDescriptor from the TreePaths?

Line:78, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetBundleAdapter.java -> isn't this toggle logic the same in every handler? We could then remove the api and implement it in TargetLocationsGroup

Line:42, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetFeatureAdapter.java -> can you extract a common super class from this and TargetBundleLocationHandler? They're mostly the same.

Line:393, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> please extract this common line from the if

Line:486, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> please rename those keys

Line:537, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> you have null handling here but not when using the return values. you could replace null with OK here, if that's a concern

Line:31, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationHandler.java -> those need javadoc

Line:35, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetBundleAdapter.java -> I think that would be possible, even though I wonder if its a real usecase to massively exclude/include bundles using this function...

Line:78, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetBundleAdapter.java -> No that's just one example how toggle can work for NameVersionDescriptor, but there might be other cases.
Beside that, the goal here is to separate logic from TargetLocationsGroup and not put in more there.

Line:42, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetFeatureAdapter.java -> Not really... they are similar but not the same. Beside that I think its better to have slight duplication to allow new features for this without affecting the others.

Line:537, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> The whole purpose of this is to log if status is non-null/notok, the caller might check later if status is actually non-null.

Line:78, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetBundleAdapter.java -> which cases exactly? Extracting logic is fine, but not at the cost of a unnecessarily larger API

Line:42, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetFeatureAdapter.java -> I diffed them. They are exactly the same except for the mode and allBundles/Features array.

Line:537, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> that's the point. Either you define null as a valid return value, then all callers must check for null (or you handle it here). Or it's not than this null check is wrong.

Now you have sonar warnings for potential NPEs all over the place.

Line:78, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetBundleAdapter.java -> Every case that extends the Target platform ... as described before I'd like to use that feature for the new Maven Target Platfrom (MTP) Location, it was then asked to add a usecase within PDE and that's what this is used for.
In case of MTP ther will be custom objects (namely dependent artifacts) that can be included/excluded regardless of actual bundles originating from those,

Line:42, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetFeatureAdapter.java -> I can try to merge as much as possible I'm still not happy about that as Bundles and Features are different things and are handled different in the target. Merging them just to safe a few lines simply makes it harder to evolve the code as always both cases has to be taken into account.

Line:537, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> I better have a sonar-type warning than a crashing target because of failing log statement, and better add null checks where they are missing instead of changing this method that is simply doing some defensive checks.

Line:78, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetBundleAdapter.java -> I'm not talking about exclude/include, only toggle. As the UI already defines toggle as canEnable&&canDisable I don't see why every the handler has to implement the same toggle logic (instead of only enable & disable).

Line:78, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetBundleAdapter.java -> Ah sorry for that, this is because the TreePath can contain mixed items (some might need to be enabled some might need to be disabled). Because there is (at the moment) only one item it is simple here. As soon as I handle multiple items as suggested thing won't be that simple.

Line:78, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetBundleAdapter.java -> what do you mean by multiple items?

To be clear: I want to move this toggle method (including this exact implementation) out of the API and into TargetLocationsGroup/TargetLocationHandlerAdapter

Line:78, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetBundleAdapter.java -> Say you have Bundle A+B, bundle A is excluded, then select A+B the press the toggle button.
I have tried to move the logic of toggling into TargetLocationHandlerAdapter and could not made this case work reliable and smooth.
Beside that, instead of one toggle method then two methods (enable/disable) are required making the API larger and not smaller...

Line:78, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetBundleAdapter.java -> Please ignore my comments, I thought enable and disable were already API so I didn't see why we would need an additional toggle method. Sorry about that...
