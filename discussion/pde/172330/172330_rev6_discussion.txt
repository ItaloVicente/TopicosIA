what's the usecase for enable/disable? It's not used by any PDE locationhandler, right?
Same question for reload.
Line:30, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/BundleContainerFactory.java -> do we need this check? seems to me that if a target location opts-in by specifying this adapter, it's valid

Line:46, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/BundleContainerFactory.java -> I would rename that to selection, root sounds like the first segment IMHO

Line:83, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> once the singleSelection requirement is removed, this behaves differently (i.e. runs multiple times).

It might be better to change the api to Collection<TreePath> and group the selection by the handler.

Line:85, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> I would have written that as 

  if (lastSegment instanceof IUBundleContainer) {
  ...
  } else if (lastSegment instanceof IUWrapper) {
  ...
  }

Line:121, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> can the IUWrapper even be below another root? If not,
  lastSegment instanceof Container || lastSegment instanceof Wrapper 

would be simpler.

Line:147, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> this did not force a reload before

Line:461, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> can we improved that pattern of checking both the new and old api by implementing an internal delegate that implements all three interfaces? Similar to what LogicalStructureType does in releaseValue.

Line:547, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> TODO?

Line:552, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> that looks like a copy-paste error. Also I don't think singleSelection is requirement for canUpdate

Line:553, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> same here

Line:564, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> I find a button that handles both removal and enablement hard to comprehend from a UX point of view

Line:85, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/UpdateTargetJob.java -> the multiplication factor can be removed, that's already done by SubMonitor internally

Line:64, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/messages.properties -> please don't follow that horrible naming convention ;)

Line:29, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationHandler.java -> not extending ITargetLocationUpdater was a good choice!

Line:29, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationUpdater.java -> need javadoc that points to the new api

> Same question for reload.

I have enhanced the maven target[1] based on this gerrit-code to show how it could be used. The "reload" in its current implementation is doing some very specific P2 stuff to force reload, but for other target locations this is currently a noop. So it seems logical to integrate this into the LocationHandler API as well.
Theoretically the BundleContainerFactory could use this to re-read the location from disk, but I don't want to change too much on "old" behaviour. Also a Bundlecontainer might supply all files as childs so it is possible to exclude a certain file, but this would also be new behavior.

[1] https://github.com/eclipse-m2e/m2e-core/pull/34
Line:30, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/BundleContainerFactory.java -> I think it doesn't hurt to make sure only supported locations are adapted.

Line:46, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/BundleContainerFactory.java -> BundleContainerFactory's don't have children so it is effectively the same but for clarity I'll change this.

Line:83, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> I think this does not hurt much but using Collection<TreePath> will complicate code on consumer AND producer side a lot as it would require to compute some intersection pool of handlers and pathes.

Line:85, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> Done

Line:121, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> Done

Line:147, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> The code before was a bit confusing about its intention, but if a unit is removed the target might became invalid because a requirement is missing (at least in planer mode!). Also from my testing if the reload is not forced, cached states might not be always flushed.

Line:461, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> I don't think this would make things more clear, I first tried to use some kind of combined interface but dropped this as it makes it more complicate to remove the old interface some time later.

Line:547, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> Done

Line:552, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> Done

Line:553, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> Done

Line:564, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> I first though about introduce yet another button, but think this overloads the interface. I think the logic for the user is clear enough:

You can either remove (single) items or you can enable/disable it. I can't think about a case where it makes sense to have both.

Line:64, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/messages.properties -> I think its the Eclipse default if one chooses "externalize strings"

Line:30, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/BundleContainerFactory.java -> It is one more location that has to be adapted when we implement a new subtype (or some external bundle does, even though it's technically not API).
Please remove it.

Line:83, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> I'll see what I can do here even though I'm not convinced it is worth the hassle consequently delete should then be changed in the same way...

Line:83, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> It does hurt, as we have to perform work multiple times, see IUBundleContainer::update

I don't see the complication, because one path can only have a single handler. So you just have to group the selections by their handler.

Line:83, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> I would not change delete. Update inherently performs network operations (= update to latest available), so it is worth optimizing - delete not so much.

Line:147, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> It is indeed confusing and might even be wrong, but that would have to be changed in a separate bug.

My reasoning is: in handleRemove(), if removedSite is true, removedContainer must be true as well. Therefore removedSite is always false in the else branch, always calling contentsChanged(false).

Line:147, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> I have noticed that but can only guess what the reason was, but from a logical point of view it doesn't make sense and the fact that not a hard-coded false was set seems to me as the original intent was a different one and the false just an unwanted side-effect.

Line:461, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationsGroup.java -> Yes, avoiding that combined API interface was a good choice. But an internal implementation class would separate the concern of handling the different versions and simplify this already large class.

But you're right, that delegate should only implement the new interface. And delegate internally, i.e.
	class TargetLocationHandlerDelegate implements ITargetLocationHandler {

		@Override public boolean canUpdate(ITargetLocation location, TreePath path) {
			Object currentSelection = path.getLastSegment();
			ITargetLocationHandler handler = Adapters.adapt(currentSelection, ITargetLocationHandler.class);
			if (handler != null)
				return handler.canUpdate(location, path);
				
			if (currentSelection instanceof ITargetLocation) {
				ITargetLocation location = (ITargetLocation) currentSelection;
				ITargetLocationUpdater updater = Adapters.adapt(location, ITargetLocationUpdater.class);
				if (updater != null)
					return updater.canUpdate(fTarget, location);
			
			return false;
		}
	}
