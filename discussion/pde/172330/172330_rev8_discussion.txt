I have now added an Adapter to adapt from Old API -> (partially) new API where possible, I also have added an TreePath[] for all methods that support multi-selection.

why did you change *all* methods to TreePath? Now we do have unnecessary complexity.
Line:35, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationHandlerAdapter.java -> this and other methods are missing the handling for ITargetLocationEditor and Updater

All methods that allow multiselection (delete, update) have TreePath[] so implementation can choose what is the most efficient way to handle this operation.
Line:35, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationHandlerAdapter.java -> ITargetLocationEditor/Updater are converted to the new handler interface so here we do not need to check for them.

Is there any implementation except for update that profits from that change?
Line:158, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> that does not belong here, it should stay in the TargetLocationsGroup

Line:35, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/TargetLocationHandlerAdapter.java -> Ah, right. I expected the legacy handling here, but the legacy adapter factory is a nice solution.

First of all, it makes the API more consistent and clear (single vs. multi select).

Apart from this, at least the serialization of the target is currently triggered multiple times, while with the change one can remove all items and then trigger the serialization once. This for sure is not a major improvement, but shows that it might be useful in the future and as the implementation can reuse the code from update I don't see much costs here.
Line:158, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> Can you explain what this does for other location types? I tried to follow whats happening here and it seems to be bound to P2 work only so it seam logical to put it into the handler of the P2/Updatesite stuff.

Line:158, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/shared/target/IUFactory.java -> I haven't looked at the implementation. My comment is based on the previous code and that it operates on the target definition and not a single location.

In any case: Any (even potential) behavior change needs its own bug.

Force target check was added for not increasing sequence during reload. . For directory or other locations, profile would be null and nothing would happen. So , only for p2 locations we have these functions ( as the names suggests too)

Christoph, Could you give a simplistic use-case for eclipse SDK specific usecase? I see that edit is enabled for few cases where resolve fails but I am unable to edit the repo location using edit and it opens the edit software content page. Also how to include and exclude content (with your patch)from within eclipse SDK using any sample target.

Thanks for clarification, that matches my testing/debugging then it should be safe to move this into the Updatsite location part.

The edit part is currently a bit strange, one can have a failed target, but edit is disabled, but you can always double-click to force an edit even if edit is disabled :-)

I'll try to adjust the Gerrit in the next days a bit. I could also try if enable/disable could be incorporated in a usecase in the "show location content" view. I'm not sure if this is suitable but the Directory locations could also be implemented "the old way" to demonstrate the fallback, just sounds a bit odd but if it helps to verify this?

the 2020-12 release will hopefully include the new m2e target location that would make it a lot easier to demonstrate demands for these adjustments.

In general I wonder if anyone is aware of any other target location additions that might be worth to contact if there are other demands from their side.

I only know of Oomph targlets. But they have their own comprehensive editor.
