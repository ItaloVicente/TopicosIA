thanks for the PR, that's very helpful!

The exclusion within the target location does conflict with the design of the target definition which has its own filter mechanism (includeBundles).
I'll be the first to admit that specifying a whitelist rather than a blacklist is at best annoying, but I'm hesitant to introduce that api/behavior.

Then again, it might be the trigger to add exclusion support to PDE's locations.

The intend is a bit different (even though similar) here:
- current "content" filtering allows to deselect bundles in the target to be included (and I agree that a blacklist would be much more sufficient)
- for the m2e part there are not directly bundles affected but "child items"

For example the user can choose to exclude a transitive dependency that otherwise will fail the target resolution (and without a valid resolution he can't exclude bundles that are part of the resolution result). In fact excluding a transitive dependency must also exclude the dependencies of that one but that's not implemented yet.

That's a bit similar if it would be possible to deactivate an IU of an update site (in contrast to remove it completely).
