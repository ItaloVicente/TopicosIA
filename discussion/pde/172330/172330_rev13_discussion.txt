Any idea whats wrong with the build?

Test fail with "There is a possible API baseline mismatch since none of the workspace projects is in the baseline"

Beside that, this would the require a Verfication by a PDE committer.

Line:24, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationEditor.java -> I wonder how one can accomplish the task of supporting editing for a specialized target without violating this constraint?

Line:28, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationEditor.java -> Why deprecate this and introduce a new interface rather adding the new method with default to this interface?

Line:24, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationEditor.java -> Don't know if there a documentation for all that @no.. but as far as I know this only means client should not extend the interface but can implement it.
The rationale for an interface might be that added constants for an interface are considered an API change, maybe with @noextend this is allowed but I'm not an API-Tools expert :-)

Line:28, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/target/ITargetLocationEditor.java -> I first tried to came up with a solution reusing/extending the old interfaces but this has created a lot of boilerplate and ambiguities.

It is now deprecated to discourage its use even though I don't know if there are actually an implementation out there for custom target beside PDE and the upcoming maven target location.

Oomph has this which implements ITargetLocationEditor:

You can upgrade the code with the following steps:

- remove ITargetLocationEditor, ITargetLocationUpdater and only implement/adapt ILocationHandler
- the old "ITargetLocation targetLocation" paramter is now replaced by a TreePath so it is possible to access the whole part, for migration one can use simply 
> ITargetLocation targetLocation = path.getLastSegment();
- update has an array of pathes, so you can add a simple loop or even do advanced stuff if it helps to update things as batch
- use any of the additional possible things now (e.g. get informed about refresh requests)

Targlets seem to have 
> new Wrapper(targlet)
children, I don't know if it makes sense, but with new API you can now edit/remove/update individual child items.
For this, simply check if the last segment is a Wrapper (the first is always the location then).

The general problem with upgrading to new improved things is that one can then no longer work in older crappier environments.  That's typically a non-starter for me and I believe that's also typical for the broader community which must often focus on broader compatibility (if they even have time to adapt to anything in the first place).

Not everyone is dedicated to "crappier environments" and actually that's what releases for, to allow change while guarding old consumers from changes. And while it makes sense for a library component (even though it can't use any valuable new features then) I don't see much value to install latest oomph-pde-tooling in ancient eclipse.

Nerveless there is no need to change anything if your fine with the old approach and don't think it would benefit from the advanced editing capabilities. If you think upgrading is useful and help is needed just let me know about the bugzilla ticket and I can even provide a gerrit for this.
