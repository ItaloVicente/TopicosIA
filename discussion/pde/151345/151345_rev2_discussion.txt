DESCRIPTION:

Bug 551620 - Introduce background-thread initialisation of FeatureIndex

 * The FeatureIndex is now internal to FeatureInput to avoid exposing too
   much implementation detail to other components of the Features view
 * Initial indexing is now deferred until the DeferredFeatureInput fetches
   its models - this ensures that both FeatureModelManager.getModels() is
   called on a background thread, and that the index itself is built on a
   background thread (though the primary cost is the former)

one more finding ;)
Line:76, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/support/FeatureIndex.java -> During debugging I've noticed that this is called on the UI. We should just null out the map here and reindex it lazily I think.

Line:76, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/support/FeatureIndex.java -> But I think the lazy-reindex would also end up happening on the UI thread (if no further work was done), most likely?

So if we are to worry about this, I suppose the options are background-thread rebuilding (which would be fiddly because you'd still have to revert to synchronous behaviour if getIncludingFeatures() was called before initialisation completes) or finer-grained handling of the models-changed event?

Line:76, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/support/FeatureIndex.java -> You're right, getIncludingFeatures() would most likely trigger a reindex in the UI.

Let's keep it as is, since the critical stuff is the feature model manager and not this index.
