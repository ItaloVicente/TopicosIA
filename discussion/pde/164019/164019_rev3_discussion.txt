DESCRIPTION:

Bug 527378 - Scan file system for features

Instead of delegating to the PluginPathFinder, look for features in the
features directory and return those URLs. Behaves the same as the
`PluginPathFinder.getFeaturePaths()` but without needing the
`platform.xml` file.

Andrey, do you have suggestions of how I can set up a mechanism that allows for dropins and links to be considered for this? Stepping through the code paths on my machine I was only able to see it using 'features' as a directory for when the platform.xml was there.

This change is independent of everything else in the series, and if you can help me understand how it may fail (or ideally, let me reproduce such a failure) then I can look into an appropriate update to this change. Since it blocks a sequence of such changes I would like to try and understand what's needed so that we can drip-feed in the changes to master as part of this clean-up effort.

Create eclipse/links directory inside your test SDK installation.

Put a text file "linkToSomeAdditionalSoftware" inside this directory

###
path=/tmp/eclipse_custom_install_root
optional=true
###

Inside /tmp/eclipse_custom_install_root should be "eclipse" directory with plugins & features directories containing your 3rd party code. If you restart Eclipse with "-clean", it should notice the additional software.
