DESCRIPTION:

Bug 552294 - [performance] Parallelize work in resolveBundles

Use a parallel stream to perform the creation of TargetBundles in
parallel. During instantiation, plugin.xml's are processed and
extensions registered. This change will speed up the process.

Patch Set 4:

For me, a target file containing default target resolves almost instantaneously even at the 1st time creation and resolve. So if there is some improvement, it is not very visible. Then I tried other targets too and I couldn't see tangible difference ( didn't use yourkit). If there is a sample target for which the performance improvement is noticeable ( even 5% or 10%) without yourkit, that would help.

I've tested it with my eclipse workspace with equinox, platform, JDT & PDE. The resolve times were about 900ms vs 300ms.
Probably depends a lot on the common forkjoin pool's size (i.e. # of CPU cores).

I'll try some more reproducible targets for comparison next week.

Either with a profiler/sampler or by adding measurements around ProfileBundleContainer::resolveBundles.

There's no tracing option available.

Thanks, I can confirm that this works fine for me and is faster. For my test ws which is relatively small it is about 20% faster.

Side remark not not blocking this review: I'm surprised that this operation seems to block startup, should this not be a background operation?
