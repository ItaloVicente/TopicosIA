this patchset is still missing good enough handling of cut/copy & paste of selected subtree of items, otherwise should be complete with all issues from comment 14 fixed

Also undo seems to be broken. If I drag and drop an item and press Ctrl+Z it moves it to the wrong position. But that is already the case in the old implementation, so we can handle this via a new bug. Also cut and paste does not work in the old implementation.

Open Bug 507740 and Bug 507742 for the existing bugs in the category editor.

Martin, your patch looks good to me and the missing functionality was missing before. I would suggest to merge it. The existing bugs can be handled by the other bug reports. Are you OK with the merge, or do you want to work on this more?

I am ok with the merge-this was last item. Will look later on separate bug.
