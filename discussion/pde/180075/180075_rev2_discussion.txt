This was just created to be able to review the potential effect of the API change. I am withdrawing it for now.

Shorter code is good and this looks like it is not on the critical code path. So I plan to merge it so that we also use the new API in your code base.

That is fine by me - please note that I have not tested this code, it was merely written to demonstrate what the code looked like. (Not that I see any reason to think it will be problematic.) 

BTW - I did not make a similar change in org.eclipse.equinox.common because the plug-in ID used in that bundle for Status objects (org.eclipse.core.runtime) does not match the bundle it is located in (org.eclipse.equinox.common)
