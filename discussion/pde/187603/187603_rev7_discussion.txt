Maybe you can checkout the patch and test if it satisfies your http://-target use-case?
If we want this to be included in the release we need some feedback/reviews ASAP...

Sorry for the delay.

I have tested this patch locally by referencing a .target file packaged into a jar using a jar-URL and it worked for a single location that only contains the eclispe.sdk, but it failed for a more complex target file with multiple locations that contain multiple elements.

In the complex example the resolution of the locations failed, which only became clear because the child targets show zero available targets. The IUBundleContainer seems to not report errors that occured during resolution, because the fResolutionStatus is reset to OK in the beginning of AbstractBundleContainer.resolve() but the actual synchronization usually happened already and therefore overrides failures. But I'm not yet sure why this failure happen.

Furthermore I think we need a dedicated ExternalTargetHandle that is also handled in TargetPlatformService.getTarget(String memento). The reason is that during resolution in P2TargetUtils.synchronize() a P2-Profile is created/registered using the target-handles memento. When the Workspace is saved on shutdown, orphans are removed from the P2-Profile-Registry and in that process the memnto is restored to a TargetHandle. But currently this does not work for external non-file targets.
The question is if the ExternalFileTargetHandle should be replaced or if a separate ExternalTargetHandle class should be created.

No problem, I just hoped Lars is testing as well so I'd like to ping him also :-)

can you share a failing example? I assume that each target itself is resolving fine as a stand-alone?

Error reporting with targets is really poor, but I can take a look at as well if I have an example for it.

I'll take a look at this but don't wanted to reuse the service to not interfere with normal target operations.
Line:83, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/target/TargetReferenceBundleContainer.java -> given that there is no attribute order in xml does it really matter?

Line:83, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/target/TargetReferenceBundleContainer.java -> This is definitely just a style/cosmetic question.
But since there are no technical objects IMHO a consistent style should be used.
