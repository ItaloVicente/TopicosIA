The good news is, my complex target now resolves too. I'm not sure, why if it was one of your changes or if something else was flawed (I tend to say it was that reason), but now it resolves.

It was a target with only multiple InstallableUnit-type locations, mostly to eclipse.org repos and one github repo and they contained a mix of feature and plug-in IUs.
Regarding your previous question: Yes they resolved as regular target-file but didn't when that target-file was packed into a jar and referenced. But as I said in my previous comment, it now works. Therefore I cannot say anymore why exactly it was failing.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:91, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/target/TargetReferenceBundleContainer.java -> Minimal cosmetic improvement: The returned reference could be assigned to the targetDefinition field directly that then could be returned.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:91, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/target/TargetReferenceBundleContainer.java -> Even though its very unlikely, but it is possible that targetDefinition filed is cleared between assignment and return, to make sure this method never return null under any circumstance this construct ensures this.
