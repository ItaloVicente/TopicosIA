The code looks good to me and works for my test-cases. Great work!

Can you add some tests?
To avoid the need for many test-resources a target-file using a directory target that is populated at runtime with jar's that only contain a Manifest could be used. All of that could be generated in the static test initializer.
The utilities that I'm currently improving in the following Gerrit and its predecessor could make that quite simple:
https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/pde/eclipse.pde.ui/+/186942
Unfortunately they are not yet ready. If you would prefer it I can also create some tests in a follow up.

@Vikas do we need PMC approval here, or should we just wait until stabilization week(Friday??) is over? Any guidance would be appreciated.

In RC phase, non-API changes need to be approved by a project lead (eg Vikas) or PMC member who decides whether it's safe to incorporate the change with limited ability to fix it before release. If the change is not considered as safe enough; it will have to wait for next release.

https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/development/plans/freeze_plan_4_22.php API change is allowed in RC1
However 

RC1

All fixes submitted must have a project lead or PMC vote on the bug report, and the fix must be reviewed by an additional committer (any committer other than the one who made the fix). A positive review from a project lead or PMC member means implicit approval and no vote is needed on the bug report. Ongoing changes to documentation, tests or examples do not require approval.

Thanks for the clarification, @Lars you are a committer of PDE can you review and/or suggest another committer for review so we get the necessary votes? I think even though there might be room for improvements we should get this in ASAP so people can use it and give feedback, also (for me) having it released/included in PDE would be a requirement before I start working on Tycho support for such a feature.

If there is still need for feedback, this is typically a sign that it'd better not be part of a Release Candidate and that waiting for next milestone seems much safer.

The feature is working/complete, but I found that when actually people start using it there always ideas how to improve/enhance it. I wont expect to get more feedback than we currently have from Lars+Hannes if this is only available in I-Builds.

Master should be open for 4.23 in the last week of November. That is not too far away. My view is that we can put this in 4.23. For early feedback, people can take gerrit in their workspace and check in launched eclipse.

Currently busy with sick kids, so while I love this feature (thanks Christoph and Hannes) I cannot test at the moment.
