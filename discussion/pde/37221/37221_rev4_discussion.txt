The correct file to deal with files that contain text is to use file buffers.

Then getting the line delimiter is as simple as

org.eclipse.jface.text.TextUtilities.getDefaultLineDelimiter(buffer.getDocument()).

Using file buffers also makes sure that correct encodings are used.

Thank you for the feedback, I'll try that!

No but it would still be nice to fix. I'll restore if I come back to it.

@Dani, in this patch are you suggesting replacing the current file/stream system for saving/copying target definitions with IFileBuffers?

If I get it right, IFileBuffers seem best used when dealing with IFiles and files loaded within the current workspace. However, target files can be external to the workspace (ExternalFileTargetHandle).

Or are you suggesting using the file buffer to get the line delimiter and encoding?
Or am I misinterpreting something?
Or was that comment made too long ago for you to remember?

Yes, that's the correct thing to use. Very easy, and as said, gives you the correct line delimiter and encoding.

You did not get it right ;-). File buffers also handle external files on any supported file system. It's backed by FileStore.
