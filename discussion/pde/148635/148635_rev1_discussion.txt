Looks fine for me. Any need to push this for 4.13 or can we wait to 4.14?

Why wait? It's kind of a no-op zero-risk change that eliminates the dirty state of the git repository.

the files still have CRLF line endings (although now consistently). Please convert them to LF only.

Hmmm, my repo's config itself sets autocrlf to true, so JGit should convert it when I commit it.  Maybe it's confused by the mixed endings.  I'll have to investigate (which is really hard because the IDE is very confusing in this state)...

AFAIR that doesn't work when the file already has CRLF endings in the repo. In the past I've disabled autocrlf temporarily and converted them manually.
