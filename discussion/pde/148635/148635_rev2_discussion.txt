Now the change looks massive! But I did as you said, disabled autocrlf and committed after converting to LF.  Unless I disabled that, the staged files were always converted, and that's how it looked for the last commit.  But that's how they normally look and that didn't end up commit them in this way.  So confusing. :-(

Thanks for the quick feedback and please let me know if this look correct, because likely other commits I did today will suffer the same issue.

No, all I did was convert line endings to correct them, so there is no IP contribution here.

Received CQ creation request but reviewer is not a committer on this project. A project committer must comment genie:cq to trigger CQ creation.

Massive change is good in this scenario ;) 
Looks good now. You can check it by downloading from gerrit as diff and open that in an editor.

Also, +1 for pushing now.

And I guess someone should make genie with a reply because it didn't like mine because I'm not a committer.

I don't think it reads replies. At least I have no idea how to reply "no"...
