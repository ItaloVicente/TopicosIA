Thank's for your review.
Due to the latest comments in the bug-report I had one more thought regarding the passed list of libraries.
Line:321, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/builders/BuildErrorReporter.java -> I wonder if it would be more suitable to pass sourceEntries or sourceEntryKeys instead?
The reason is that "Missing 'output.<library> entry"-problems are by default ignored in the preferences.
Therefore it could be the case that 'the output..'-entry is missing (unintentionally?) and therefore the check could also be false negative.
On the other hand this check could also be intentionally disabled by removing the output.. and setting "Missing 'output.<library>' entry" to Ignore.

Initially I choose 'outputEntries' because I assumed that 'source..' and 'output..' are either both present or both absent and 'outputEntries' seemed more suitable in terms of semantic.

I think 
	// make sure "." library is included if present
		String defaultLibraryName = PROPERTY_SOURCE_PREFIX + "."; //$NON-NLS-1$
		if (sourceEntries.stream().anyMatch(e -> e.getName().equals(defaultLibraryName))) {
			validateBinIncludes(binIncludes, "."); //$NON-NLS-1$
		}

this could work too. Will it fix the case of 

"And I have an additional, different case! I author several documentation plugins by writing Java source code files. The documentation is then built with the help of a JavaDoc doclet, which produce HTML output. This HTML content is all that I want in my deployable plugin, not the Java classes."

Does this project have java classes but no source.. entry. If  yes, this would work. Can you make another gerrit?
Line:321, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/builders/BuildErrorReporter.java -> Done

I think it would not immediately fix the described problem.
As you said it would only fix the problem, if one removes the sources.. entry. But by default this causes a warning about the missing source. entry for lib '.' too. This warning can be silenced already by ignoring "Problems with 'source.<library>' entry". But I'm not sure what kind of problems are affected by this preference. So it could be the case that other actual problems would be ignored as well.

On the other hand we already have a preference for "Missing 'output.<library>' entry"-problems, which is, at least from its name, pressingly only for missing output. entries. So with the code as it is at the moment one could simply remove the output.. entry and make sure "Missing 'output.<library>' entry" is set to 'Ignore', to silence a warning about the missing '.' value in the bin.includes entry.

Even tough it was not intended I think it would be the more precise solution for the described problem. But lets discuss this in the bug, so more can participate.

From the discussion at the bugzilla I think this change is fine and we should leave this as it is.
