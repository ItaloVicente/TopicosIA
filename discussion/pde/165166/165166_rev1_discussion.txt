Think we should pull the common code for the PluginBlock and OSGiLaunchconfig to the parent class so that we do the same filtering in both places, rather than in this state.

Also note that the filtering is not just source, but if the description is not null as well.
Line:99, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/OSGiLaunchConfigurationInitializer.java -> We're doing two different mechanisms for here and the UI, which has a SourcePluginFilter in PluginBlock (it has a getExternalModel wrapped in a filter). I think a better approach would be to do the same thing in both places.

As a side-note, the call to getActiveModels differs from haht the UI shows, which is getExternalModels.

Any filtering in the OSGiBundleBlock is too late, because the 
initializer has already written source bundles into the config.

It works for eclipse launch configs only because they're initially created with "all bundles" instead of a specific set.

Further I don't think the preference should be honored for OSGi launch configs. While it may make sense to install source bundles in a launched eclipse (for debugging source lookup etc.), I don't see a similar reason for OSGi launches. 
Or is there one?

The bundle description null check might be necessary though.

Right, but I'm saying that if you have 'don't enable source' then you can simply skip them out in the code, and by promoting the part of the PluginBlock to the parent AbstractPluginBlock then you can ignore the initial state that comes here anyway, and just use the bundles selected in the UI. That way you get the source bundles if you want them, and not if you don't.

As an example the following allows launching with/without source bundles in the OSGi launch:

So, for example, this change was added to the PluginBlock to speed it up (and had the side efffect that we were calculating the bundles to load) but the same change was never made to OSGiBundleBlock. If we had done that in OSGi bundle block, or the change in that commit was made to AbstractPluginBlock instead, then we would have the same behaviour in both:

Good point. Can you provide a patch for that?

See https://git.eclipse.org/r/165189 for example. Needs a follow up modification to OSGiLaunchConfiguration to not pre-fill the bundles which is not required any more.
