DESCRIPTION:

Bug 408699 - Downgrade missing API baseline from error to warning

As all Eclipse top-level contributors and most committers use Gerrit and
Gerrit checks this automatically, I think it should be fine to change it
to a warning. Other projects can use the same setup or change the
default on the project level.

This avoids scaring new contributors as they will not be welcomed with
errors on all projects after a fresh clone.

This initializer is not supposed to define conventions used by the eclipse project. 

I agree with your reasoning, but this needs to be configured per-project.

The bug is about changing the global setting. Your answer sounds like you understood that it is about changing it on a pro project basis.

The bug requests to change the process/behavior for the eclipse project. Not for any and all projects that are using API tooling. Therefore it needs to be solved on a project-preference level.

The bug requests the change of the global setting. Trust me on thatm Marcus was working with me in 2013 and we discussed it at this point in time. If the bug report is misleading, please let me know I can update it.
