DESCRIPTION:

Bug 488800 - Add org.osgi.service.component.annotations package to
Plug-in Project build path 

1. Added bundle org.eclipse.pde.ds.lib with annotations.jar containing
org.osgi.service.component.annotations package (with sources) so that
users can reference the annotations at build time only instead of using
Import-Package.

2. Contributed annotations.jar into bundle plug-in projects' transient
build path (based on preferences) so that DS annotations are immediately
available to users without additional configuration.

3. Added problem marker (with resolutions) to remind users to include
annotations.jar in their projects' permanent build path if only the
transient contributed entry is detected.

You add the annotations in a separate project o.e.pde.ds.lib that wraps the annotations.jar. I wonder if that is really necessary, as the annotations are provided by o.e.osgi.services already. Wouldn't it be better to include the existing Equinox annotations?

o.e.osgi.services comes with v1.3 of annotations; the new lib project carries v1.2. What I'd like to do going forward is support both, based on project/workspace setting. This is the first step toward it.

The reason it's in a separate jar like that is that the classpath contribution mechanism requires it. Even with v1.3 annotations, I'd have to re-package them into a separate jar (at build time) so they can be prepended to a plugin's build classpath (and not runtime).

I should read the ticket comments first, before making comments myself.
I just checked if there is a bundle with 1.2 annotations available like it is for 1.3. But it seems not.

From what I have read I think it should be fine. But I would like to test this first in an Oxygen build. Could you please rebase the patch so I can try?
