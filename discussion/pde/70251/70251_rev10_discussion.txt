DESCRIPTION:

Bug 488800 - Add org.osgi.service.component.annotations package to
Plug-in Project build path 

1. Added bundle org.eclipse.pde.ds.lib with annotations.jar containing
org.osgi.service.component.annotations package (with sources) so that
users can reference the annotations at build time only instead of using
Import-Package.

2. Contributed annotations.jar into bundle plug-in projects' transient
build path (based on preferences) so that DS annotations are immediately
available to users without additional configuration.

3. Added problem marker (with resolutions) to remind users to include
annotations.jar in their projects' permanent build path if only the
transient contributed entry is detected.

Thanks for the hint. I could of course do that. But then I would review something else than this patch. ;)

I did some tests and from within the IDE it looks good so far. I created a simple API bundle, then some provider bundles to test the different build variants and a small RCP project to consume stuff. I can start it without issues from within the IDE. I can export in all cases without issues. But the exported product doesn't start. But I suppose that is a different issue.
I wanted to test how a Tycho build would behave, but that would of course not succeed because the pde.ds.lib bundle is not available in any repo.

So far it looks good. Would need to see how it behaves in different scenarios, especially with Tycho builds. But probably the optional import package statements are necessary for the build, and with the Quick Fix it is easier to make the configuration.
