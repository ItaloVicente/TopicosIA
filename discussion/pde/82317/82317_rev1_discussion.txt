Thanks Martin, this a big usability issue, great that you are looking into it.

I started with the review CheckboxTreePart but I think this new class is not needed. I suggest to use CheckboxTablePart.

See https://git.eclipse.org/r/82418 for quick adjustment of your code. If you agree, please update your review.

It would also be nice, if you can add internally "*" to the filter, if the user does not specify a wildcard. We do this in the other places in PDE, where you can filter and we should be consistent here.
Line:29, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/parts/CheckboxTreePart.java -> Can be removed, this was only necessary in the old code before we had @Override

Line:41, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/parts/CheckboxTreePart.java -> I suggest lambda style listeners

Line:47, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/parts/CheckboxTreePart.java -> I suggest lambda style listeners

reason for creating CheckboxTreePart and WizardCheckboxTreePart (instead of modyfication of existing CheckboxTablePart and  WizardCheckboxTablePart)  was that when i initially tried to plug-in FilteredCheckboxTree into CheckboxTablePart then it started to be confusing that 'table' classes ( with methods like getTableViewer, getTable) would work with TreeViewer, tree, treeitem (FilteredCheckboxTree)

as bug request was to add filtered Tree, it seemed cleaner to have tree part variant of table parts even it is duplicating some code (mostly naming and tree vs table types are different).

i see 3 possible ways, but i am not sure
1. patch first approach -  way of having TreePart with FilteredCheckboxTree
2. from review comment1 - use FilteredCheckboxTree in TablePart , do not introduce new TreePart classes variants
3. maybe add table filter into table already TablePart, not use FilteredCheckboxTree

i feel good about for 1), but also 2 or 3 can be used to..
any comment if i am missing something or i misunderstood proposed patch change somehow?
