DESCRIPTION:

Bug 477578: PDE activator slows down startup of Eclipse

The contribution to the org.eclipse.ui.services extension point
had the effect that the PDE bundle (and all it's dependencies)
where activated already at start up of the platform.
In use-cases where PDE is installed but not used (e.g. because
one does pure Java development) this is not necessary.

As all the bundle activation happens sequentially in the UI 
thread this directly adds up to the start up time during which
the user sees the splash screen.

The ImageBrowserView no longer uses a service to communicate the
selected image to the SaveToWorkspace command handler. As the 
view and the command handler are anyway hardly coupled the 
decoupling via a service does not bring any advantages but only
bring the performance penalty at start up.
