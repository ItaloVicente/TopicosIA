Alexander, do you want to have a look at this?

I tried to resolve warnings if possible and suppressed those where it was not. The latter were mainly discouraged-access warnings. I tried to make those suppression as narrow as possible/suitable which is why I often used the fully-qualified names of classes to avoid the need to suppress restriction-warnings for the entire class.

This gerrit is a bit too big for my taste. Looking at first few files, it would be best to split in several per topic commits (just in case there is some issue and to make reviewing easier) like:
* file reading change
* non-nls change
* deprecated usage replacement
* etc.

Acknowledged. I will split this up.
