DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576736 - Run API analysis in a job

- added "Run API analysis builder as job" option for PDE
- this option is disabled by default
- enabling it would run API analysis builder tasks parallel to the
running Java build
- for full workspace build this avoids the problem that Java builder of
next projects to build have to wait for API build of the current project

Line:637, apitools/org.eclipse.pde.api.tools/src/org/eclipse/pde/api/tools/internal/ApiDescription.java -> I had to reduce locks amount to avoid deadlocks. Looks like different projects re-use shared data structures

Line:828, apitools/org.eclipse.pde.api.tools/src/org/eclipse/pde/api/tools/internal/builder/ApiAnalysisBuilder.java -> That must be given right after analysis is done now (so argument to the method), otherwise analyzer is disposed after and problems disposed too :-)

Why do we need to have this as configuration option? If it works fine, please always run this as job. not need IMHO to have a default slow mode and a fast mode which can be activated.

Because of
1) All PDE API tests expect the build to finish immediately and see the results ASAP.
2) I can't give a guarantee there is a problem with the new patch, because this is ancient code that *never ever* run outside the build job.

So my idea would be to have the preference, test it in real life for a while, switch option if that seem to work and may be make it invisible later.
