DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576736 - Run API analysis in a job

- added "Run API analysis builder as job" option for PDE
- this option is disabled by default
- enabling it would run API analysis builder tasks parallel to the
running Java build
- for full workspace build this avoids the problem that Java builder of
next projects to build have to wait for API build of the current project

I had a look today. 

1) Should setSystem for ApiAnalysisJob be set to true? I was expecting to see some of the API scan kind of text in the progress view and was confused if API analysis is running or not. Will many items
in progress view confuse the user? If so, we can explicitly mention that in the name of option to "Run Analysis builder as a system job". Once I set this to non-system job, I could see that once project 2 starts building, API analysis of project 1 is also happening. Unless it is an issue, it may be better  if API analysis is revealed to the user ( as before). Also I checked when project 2 is dependent on proj1, changing in project 1 triggers all the correct builds ( in the correct sequence).

2) I think we should have 1 build ( not normal but extra build where this option is true) by default few days after this goes into I build. Initial few days can be tested on I build ( with preference option). And as Lars says, we can remove this option altogether post M2 ( assuming things are fine) or even before that.

3) Locally I could see lot of performance improvements
30-45 sec without this change ( mean of around 35
20-30 sec when option is on ( mean of around 25)

4) I got a NPE but it looks totally "unrelated" to this change. Steps ( add baseline in launched eclipse and then close launched eclipse). I doubt if this will recreate or not.
Root exception:
java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.internal.provisional.model.IApiComponent.dispose()" because "component2" is null
	at org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.internal.model.ApiBaseline.doDispose(ApiBaseline.java:810)
	at org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.internal.model.ApiBaseline.dispose(ApiBaseline.java:796)
	at org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.internal.ApiBaselineManager.stop(ApiBaselineManager.java:548)
	at org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.internal.provisional.ApiPlugin.stop(ApiPlugin.java:697)

	at org.eclipse.osgi.internal.framework.BundleContextImpl.stop(BundleContextImpl.java:856)
	at org.eclipse.osgi.internal.framework.EquinoxBundle.stopWorker0(EquinoxBundle.java:1033

So I think we can probably commit this with showing this API Analysis job to the user ( I would prefer this) or atleast changing the name of the preference
