DESCRIPTION:

Bug 576736 - Run API analysis in a job

- added "Run API analysis builder as job" option for PDE
- this option is disabled by default
- enabling it would run API analysis builder tasks parallel to the
running Java build
- for full workspace build this avoids the problem that Java builder of
next projects to build have to wait for API build of the current project

> 1) Should setSystem for ApiAnalysisJob be set to true?

Done.

> 2) I think we should have 1 build ( not normal but extra build where this option is true) by default few days after this goes into I build. Initial few days can be tested on I build ( with preference option). And as Lars says, we can remove this option altogether post M2 ( assuming things are fine) or even before that.

We will see :-)
 
> 3) Locally I could see lot of performance improvements
> 30-45 sec without this change ( mean of around 35
> 20-30 sec when option is on ( mean of around 25)

Good.

> 4) I got a NPE but it looks totally "unrelated" to this change. Steps ( add baseline in launched eclipse and then close launched eclipse). I doubt if this will recreate or not.
> Root exception:
> java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.internal.provisional.model.IApiComponent.dispose()" because "component2" is null
> 	at org.eclipse.pde.api.tools.internal.model.ApiBaseline.doDispose(ApiBaseline.java:810)

Yes, looks unrelated.

> So I think we can probably commit this with showing this API Analysis job to the user ( I would prefer this) or atleast changing the name of the preference

I've updated the patch to show the job to user.

Thanks for the review.
