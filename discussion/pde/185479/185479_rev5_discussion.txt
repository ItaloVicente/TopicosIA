I plan to move also the individual spies to pde but wanted to start with the "core".

Just a remark : 

I see the name tools.spy.core for the project and bundle... but in dependencies we have links to ui plugins... 
I understand the goal of this plugin : providing the basement for spies... but is core a good name for that as we advise people to use core for non ui plugins in Eclipse Plugin development  ? 

On the other hand you have pde.tools.spy ... ? Which one do you plan to keep... pde.tools.spy seems to match exactly the problem : spy are tooling to help to develop plugins...

Ok, lets use org.eclipse.pde.spy.core? As pde is already about tools, tools would be too much. Do you agree?

Or even org.eclipse.pde.spy would be my 1st choice, and the 2nd choice : pde.spy.core

Lets go for org.eclipse.pde.spy.core, we can then have org.eclipse.pde.spy.model, etc. and they sort nicely.
