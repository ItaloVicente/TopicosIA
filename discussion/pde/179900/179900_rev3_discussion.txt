DESCRIPTION:

Bug 573187: Add extra information to test failures

As this bug has occurred before, and is likely to occur again,
improve the error message on test fails. With this message, the
error would include "test.bundle.a has unresolved constraints:
org.eclipse.core.runtime 0.0.0" which, once I saw it, helped
track down the problem much more easily.
