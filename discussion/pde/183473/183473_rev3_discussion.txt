DESCRIPTION:

Bug 575115 - replace DependencyCalculator by DependencyManager

The DependencyManager is more accurate (i.e. considers
required-capabilities) and there is no need to maintain
two classes with the same purpose.

With the example from bug 547013 more plugins are added.

Compared to the old implementation, the following plugins are added additionally:
- <plugin id="org.apache.felix.scr"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.ant.core"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.compare.core"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.core.filesystem"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.core.filesystem.win32.x86_64" fragment="true"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.core.resources"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.core.resources.win32.x86_64" fragment="true"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.core.variables"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.help"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.jface.notifications"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.team.core"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.ui"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.ui.trace"/>
- <plugin id="org.eclipse.ui.workbench"/>

org.apache.felix.scr gets added via Require-Capability which is what we expect.

The rest gets added via plugin extension points. E.g. org.eclipse.emf.ecore.xmi contains an org.eclipse.team.core.fileTypes extension which now pulls in org.eclipse.team.core + dependencies.

I don't know whether that's what we want. On the one hand, it's consistent with launch configuration behavior. On the other hand, a product containing a fileTypes extensions does not actually need org.eclipse.team.core.

Lars, it's your product definition - WDYT?
Line:353, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/editor/product/PluginSection.java -> I'm getting NPEs on Set.copyOf() because this line returns null (given the example product in bug 547013).

cause: plugin.getVersion() is not null, but ""

Line:356, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/editor/product/PluginSection.java -> DependencyCalculator supported null elements, so we need to filter here.
Also why don't you collect the plugins to a HashSet directly?

Line:71, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/wizards/product/ProductFromExtensionOperation.java -> excludeFragments is not nullable (DependencyManager:279)

Pulling in org.eclipse.team.core because of a defined extension in EMF for it would NOT be desired for RCP development. IMHO plugin.xml extensions are optional and should not be considered during dependency resolution as before.

Adding Ed, in case he wants to comment.

That was also my gut reaction.

Now the question is why/if we'd want to include plugin extensions during launching. IMO they should be ignored there also. 
For extensions like org.eclipse.team.core.fileTypes there is no reason to include the defining plugin.
And most extensions would also have a plugin dependency anyway because the extension point declares some interface.

I agree. Launch configuration should also not add these automatically. A extension to an extension point is IMHO not a hard-requirement for the defining plug-in to be present. If this is required a import package or required plug-in should be present.

Opened bug 575237 for this.

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:353, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/editor/product/PluginSection.java -> I applied a filter for null models.

Also I use VersionUtil.isEmptyVersion() to check if the version is null, empty or "0.0.0" and use null in all of this cases. This results in the latest version to be used.

Line:356, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/editor/product/PluginSection.java -> Regarding using HashSet directly: I just didn't consider it yet and had the follow-up change in mind, where the argument is changed to be a Collection anyways. But for now it is changed to be a set directly.
