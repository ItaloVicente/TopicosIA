I haven't looked at it in detail yet, but one initial finding:

When I change something in the Category Definition page and then switch to source, the XML syntax highlighting is missing.

I do not have this effect: after adding or removing category on "Category Definition" page I can see the highlighting on the source page, regardless to dirty state.

java.runtime.name=OpenJDK Runtime Environment
java.runtime.version=12.0.1+12

Probably I need to do something else to repeat it

I've updated my TP to the latest I-Build and the issue is gone...

Next issue ;)
1) select category in first page
2) switch to source page and back
3) change name of initially selected category
--> new name won't be saved

In general, the displayed controls seem to be disconnected from the model after switching from source page. Name changes in source page are also not immediately reflected in the text controls (I have to select the category again to trigger a refresh).

Yes, there are scenarios that may confuse user. I think that some of them can be repeated without this patch.
It appears CategoryEditor has no "model" derived from org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.text.IDocumentElementNode behind it.
And I'm not sure I want to add one, because to keep the style it will require to add two or more packages of pretty vintage code.

Probably, the approach to use org.eclipse.pde.internal.ui.editor.PDEFormEditor as a parent class was wrong from the very beginning and I need to try TargetEditor approach (FormEditor + ExtensionBasedTextEditor). But the ExtensionBasedTextEditor is internal type and I have no idea what is the plan regarding it.

@Lars, what is the recommended way to implement a multipage manifest editor (forms+source) from the platform perspective?

The feature editor seems to clear selection of the details section when switching back from the source page (select a plugin in included plugins page, switch to feature.xml and back -> plugin details is empty).

I think we could do the same here.

Alexander, I never implemented a multi-page editor so I don't know.
