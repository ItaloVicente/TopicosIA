It's first entry here https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/4.23-I-builds/I20220119-1320/plugins/ . Andrey, you probably have to do like https://git.eclipse.org/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui.git/commit/?id=81afb4771709e49140c440fcd19a50823fdbf04a but for assertj. And probably for everything else in our Orbit repo. Note that after March release we are no longer putting dependencies to Orbit but rather use the Maven artifacts directly. Considering that Roland is reducing time spent on Orbit (https://www.eclipse.org/lists/orbit-dev/msg05533.html) and it's just an extra work for nothing now reducing dependency on it in your workflow would be needed.

My -1 is because we shouldn't try to put workarounds for old build/setup style as it will soon enough be impossible. Even if in this case it's simple one it would be better for everyone to not investigate similar issue again soon.

Fully agree.

As Alex said the root of the issue should be addressed.

Does this mean Orbit will be completely inactive/shutdown in the future (existing repos will probably stay)?

Is there an issue/mailing list feed where this is discussed? I think this makes many things much simpler, but at the moment Orbit contains artifacts (like for logback or Guava) that are not only Eclipse jar-signed 1-to-1 mirrors from Maven central. Therefore I would be interested in those cases are addressed.

See https://git.eclipse.org/r/c/platform/eclipse.platform.ui/+/189808

My problem was that all "non-Orbit" replacement bundles have different bundle id's, so one has to search who and where defines the new id :-(

Remains to be seen. It's up to whether someone steps up to publish releases, fix builds and etc. And of course whether there are still people adding content to Orbit if not bringing any value anymore to them.

I think that Orbit will be around (for the foreseable future) for such cases until there is extra work required to keep it alive (e.g. move away of gerrit/cgit or similar). But overall it will be less and less used and needed. It's projects decisions how they will handle things e.g. Eclipse Platform latest discussion on the topic has been https://www.eclipse.org/lists/platform-dev/msg03213.html . This doesn't mandate anything for other projects though.
Of course general Orbit questions are best discussed at orbit-dev IMHO.
P.S. Regarding Guava I find it more productive to remove its usage in the projects I'm involved in as it doesn't bring much when using newer JVM. Not successful in every case but overall I'll get there once using Java 17 as min version.
P.S. 2 Ant is probably the toughest Orbit bundle but as no one but platform contributes it and it's less and less popular it's yet another story which I think it's best to let it to time to decide.

Yeah, unfortunately Orbit bundles decided to use different OSGi symbolic names than what upstream developers decided it to be. I have been bitten countless times by that in my Fedora work and it helped me make my mind that Orbit is counterproductive as it alienates Eclipse plugin developers from rest of Java world.
