DESCRIPTION:

Bug 526910 - Configure "test"-attribute for source folders in test
plugins

Adds a new setting "Test plugins" in Preferences > Plugin Development
that is interpreted as regular expression.

The source folders of plugins that are matched by it are automatically
configured to contain test sources.

This allows the test source related tooling to be used (e.g. different
icons for test source folders; filtering of search result and
hierarchies; using the dynamic working sets to e.g. hide test warning
from the problems view)

AFAICS this does not work as intended.

My process:

1.) Create a new plug-in called lars.tests (project name == bundle-symbolic Name.
2.) Checked src folder properties but test flag was not set https://ibb.co/gLTpNc

Other suggestions:

- I think putting this new setting into a Group would be helpful, with Group text "Text plug-in identifier"
- Explaination text is below the fields, I think it should be above
- If you use a group, please change Test plugins to "ID pattern" or something more descriptive. For me it is unclear without looking at the code, if the pattern matches the project name or the bundle-symbolic-name
- AFAICS we use plug-in in the PDE UI instead of plugin.

You need to toggle this option to true. And then the src folder having testt will have darker color and there are other functionalities as well similar to https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.8/M5/#JDT

+1

Why is this not also on the package?

Shouldnt there be any option while creating a source folder?

If there are 10 test folders, is it possible to toggle all of them in 1 go?

From the commit message:
The source folders of plugins that are matched by it are automatically configured to contain test sources. 

So I think this should be done by this development. Till, can you clarify?
