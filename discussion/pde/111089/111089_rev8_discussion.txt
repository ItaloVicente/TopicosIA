DESCRIPTION:

Bug 526910 - Configure "test"-attribute for source folders in test
plugins

Adds a new setting "Test plugins" in Preferences > Plugin Development
that is interpreted as regular expression.

The source folders of plugins that are matched by it are automatically
configured to contain test sources.

This allows the test source related tooling to be used (e.g. different
icons for test source folders; filtering of search result and
hierarchies; using the dynamic working sets to e.g. hide test warning
from the problems view)

The grouping makes it look better. For me I still need to toggle the value in Java build page to see the test folder icons change into darker color.

Lars, can you please check if this works for you.

Also when I click "Update the classpath settings" from Manifest file, the test folder's darker color goes back to original lighter color. Is this expected?

Hmmm then something is wrong, the whole point of this bug is that you should not have to!

No, but this is probably the same problem as above.

The pattern is matched a against the project name and the default pattern matches
anything ending in .test or .tests or containing .tests.

Maybe your test project's name doesn't match this pattern?

This was indeed the case. There are queries I have that can probably be taken up in 4.7M7 ( if required)

Lars, can you please check patch 8 and if you think it works for you, you can merge this ( today being last day of feature work). Any polish items ( if any) can be taken up in 4.7M7.

Please let me know your views.

Works fine. Would be nice if the new plug-in creation wizard would be aware of this setting and also set the test source flag. Manually using PDE to update the classpath after using PDE to create it is a bit... But this can be handled via another bug and has no high priority IMHO. 

I merge it, as Vikas gave already his OK.

Lars, can you please open a bug for this?  Although it doesn't have high priority, I think it is good to track this usability improvement via a bug.
