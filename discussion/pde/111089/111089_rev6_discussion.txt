DESCRIPTION:

Bug 526910 - Configure "test"-attribute for source folders in test
plugins

Adds a new setting "Test plugins" in Preferences > Plugin Development
that is interpreted as regular expression.

The source folders of plugins that are matched by it are automatically
configured to contain test sources.

This allows the test source related tooling to be used (e.g. different
icons for test source folders; filtering of search result and
hierarchies; using the dynamic working sets to e.g. hide test warning
from the problems view)

@Vikas, thanks for having a look, too.

> Why is this not also on the package?
Many developer put test code in the same package as the test to be tested (as they use package scope to make internals accessible to the test code), so it would have to be on the package fragment. But test code also needs to be put into a different output folder as the main code, therefore the solution is to have this on the source folder level.

> Shouldn't there be any option while creating a source folder?
Good suggestion, I've created bug 531693 for this.

> If there are 10 test folders, is it possible to toggle all of them in 1 go?
Currently not.  Maybe as context menu entry?
