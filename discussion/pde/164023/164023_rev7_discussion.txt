DESCRIPTION:

Bug 527378 - Remove ancient support for 3.3.0

There should be no requirement why we need to support being able to
launch PDE 3.3.0 and below targets, and this calls APIs that presuppose
the existence of APIs exposed by the old update manager code.

Thanks, Alex for the explanation, Unfortunately, I verified that the message can be shown. ;-)

With the change the start of a generated RCP applications fails. Steps:

1.) Create RCP app with e4 template
2.) Start via the product -> Update manager not supported dialog

I think what's happening in this instance is that if the simpleconfigurator isn't present in the template, it falls back to scanning everything. We might need to do something more intelligent here in that case.

What is the exact template you're using, so I can recreate it locally? I wasn't able to repro it but I'm sure I was just looking at the wrong template/example/product/setup.

I've not been able to find that project in examples, presumably because of missing plugins etc. Could you zip up the project and attach it to the bug so that I know I'm testing the same thing?
