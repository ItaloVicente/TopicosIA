DESCRIPTION:

Bug 527378 - Remove ancient support for 3.3.0

There should be no requirement why we need to support being able to
launch PDE 3.3.0 and below targets, and this calls APIs that presuppose
the existence of APIs exposed by the old update manager code.

Patch Set 6:

So for these changes, the general test is "Can you launch an application with PDE successfully" -- in other words, does it break existing PDE launches in any way.

This specific change is disabling functionality for when you're using PDE to launch an Eclipse platform against PDE 3.3. I think to properly test whether you see the error would be to try and use PDE to launch an Eclipse Europa runtime. (Or maybe Callisto; I can't remember if it is less than or less than or equal in the test.)

For me, I'm happy if this change doesn't break anything. I've not tested whether the error message when launching Europa based environments is shown though; it was just removing the code paths that lead to the update manager removal.

Since we're removing the update manager anyway, chances are Europa based runtimes wouldn't work properly.

So for me, the test is "Does PDE continue to work as before" :)
