> @Lars is it really necessary to listen for *file* changes or can one have a preference listener? What is the recommended eclipse way here?

To be honest I didn't consider the Preference listener option, but this definitely the cleaner way.
I adjusted this change accordingly.

Furthermore I adjusted the change as suggested in the bug-report: derived resources are no longer ignored.

In general I think the WorkspaceModelManager and it's sub-classes should be reworked to not walk ResourceDeltas but instead to check if the files of a project they are interested in (specified by a path) have changed and then work on the corresponding file-delta directly. This would make it IMHO more clear what's interesting and could also be slightly more performant. But this is another issue.

@Lars the example to Preference-Listeners on your website (https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipsePreferences/article.html#reacting-to-changes-in-the-preferences) seems to be out-dated. At least I only found the method addPreferenceChangeListener().

Line:501, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/WorkspacePluginModelManager.java -> What a bout new projects? I think this must be done when the Model is first known to the manager and should be removed when it is detached from it.

Line:37, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/model/WorkspaceProductModelManager.java -> Just wondering: Ar products contained in a derived folder not interesting? I don't know of any auto generated product but it is possible to have one...

Line:501, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/WorkspacePluginModelManager.java -> New Projects are handled above in the override of the visit(IResourceDelta) method.
It is important to add this listener to all projects because, one could also create a project that is initially not 'interesting' for this Plug-in ModelManager because it has no MANIFEST.MF (at the expected location) or in the extreme case one starts with a plain empty project without any nature and then createModel() is not called.

Line:37, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/model/WorkspaceProductModelManager.java -> I mainly did this because the check for a derived resource was removed in the superclasses' visit method and because this is the only manager that does not require special parent folders and therefore would search the entire file/folder structure of a project, I added this to not alter the behavior here.

But in general I think auto-generated products could be possible. On the other hand we have to be careful because some builders copy resources into output folders. I don't now if there is a builder that does this for products but it should be considered.

Line:37, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/model/WorkspaceProductModelManager.java -> I think we must not consider output folders in general but any source folder. And those could of course contain  generated sources.

This state is what I can contribute to the problem for now. I can continue to work on this on Friday.

Given that there is approval to submit this for the upcoming release please feel free to continue this if you want it to be completed before.
Line:501, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/WorkspacePluginModelManager.java -> Sounds not too bad, but requires to open up the the PluginModelManager to be accessible, which should be well thought.
Alternatively this manager could react to events when a nature or a builder is added (are there such events?) respectively react to resources changes in the .project file. But this would require again reaction to file events.

Line:37, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/views/features/model/WorkspaceProductModelManager.java -> That's right. But what about ordinary folders (that are neither src nor output folders) for example the 'target' folder in a Maven project? Some maven plug-ins could copy the .product file there and then it would be found twice. The target folder is derived by default which is why they are not found now.

There are different techniques to inversion-of-control beside that I think it won'T harm to have some kind of "updateproject(...)" accessible...

> Alternatively this manager could react to events when a nature or a builder is added (are there such events?) 

No idea :-)

That's right. But there is another problem. The IProjectNature.configure() for PluginProjects, i.e. org.eclipse.pde.internal.core.natures.PluginProject is only called when the project is configured/created. If it is just opened configuration is not performed.

Therefore I think the listener attachment should just be handled in the WorkspaceModelManager as it is.
