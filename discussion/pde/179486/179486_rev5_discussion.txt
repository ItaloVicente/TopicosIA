As expected the merge conflict was only because the plug-in's version was already incremented in the meantime. I set it to 3.16 as I assumed that you want a minor version bump and adjusted the new @since tags accordingly.
From here I think Julian has to take over again.

Thanks Hannes, what do you think about this change as a PDE committer should we probably just merge it and do additional things like adding new extension points in a separate change?

You're welcome.
I would prefer to give Julian some time to decide it since it is his change and I'm not in the topic at the moment. Furthermore the Milestone 2 week starts tomorrow IIRC and we should not deliver a partly finished feature to the milestone.
Nevertheless you should be able to push a follow up change with your continued work so it can be submitted together.

Yes, that's my preference. We should not ship this change standalone.

Abandoned due to Github migration. Feel free to migrate this change if you want to start working on the extension point.
