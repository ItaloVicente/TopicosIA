Line:23, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/builders/IBundleHeaderMarkerFactory.java -> this interface should have a more generic name so it could be reused by bug 572920.

Line:23, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/builders/IBundleHeaderMarkerFactory.java -> What about PDEMarkerFactory?

Naming issue aside, if you don't have any more concerns with API proposal, I would leave the rest to you Christoph ;)
Line:23, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/builders/IBundleHeaderMarkerFactory.java -> PDEMarkerFactory already exists, did you mean to make that API? I don't think those constants should be used by contributed validations. They would conflicts with PDE's marker resolution.

Maybe IValidationMarkerFactory? That should not be too ambiguous.

Line:25, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/builders/IBundleHeaderMarkerFactory.java -> For me it looks confusing, I would expect a factory to return created instance

otherwise another name method like `attachMarker` would be more appropriate.

And even more, `AttachMarker` could be an interface name 
```
interface AttachMarker extends Consumer<Map<String, ? extends Object>>
```

good point!

> extends Consumer<Map<String, ? extends Object>>
I don't understand that one. Why? What for?

Line:25, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/builders/IBundleHeaderMarkerFactory.java -> just because it is more a consumer of attributes than a factory of markers
+ it could be used more laconic where consumer is appropriate

Line:25, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/builders/IBundleHeaderMarkerFactory.java -> Why not use the method reference if you do need a Consumer? Otherwise we would have to add extends Consumer to basically everything containing a void method ;)

good point 😊

I was thinking that it will be a kind of self repeating

```
interface AttachMarker {
   void attach(Map<String, ? extends Object> attributes);
}
```
vs
```
interface AttachMarker extends Consumer<Map<String, ? extends Object>> {
}
```

Actually I don't have strong preference, perhaps the first one looks even better

I have no concerns, will this be merged or should I add to this PR? Are the comments from Alex already resolved or is there something left?

I think they are, once we rename the marker factory+method.

You can amend this commit directly.

it seems amending this is not possible for non-commiters, can we merge this first and I create a new change instead?

please push your changes as a separate commit then and we'll merge them together.

Sorry but this got a bit out of scope... maybe someone with PDE-committer.power can rebase this to see if it still could be applied?

From Gerrit's web-interface this is not possible:

Looks like this needs a manual rebase. Probably the version in the pde.core MANIFEST.MF/pom.
