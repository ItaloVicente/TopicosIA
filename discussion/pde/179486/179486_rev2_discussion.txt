- made IHeader public API
- use HeaderMap in JarManifestErrorReporter.fHeaders to support access
  without key.toLowerCase()
- run contributed validators in BundleErrorReporter

Line:24, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/builders/IBundleHeaderValidator.java -> I would rather expect an interface like

`VALIDATION_RESULT validate(Map<String, IHeader> headers)`

(where VALIDATION_RESULT is a list of "virtual markers")

and have an
```
interface IBundleHeaderValidatorFactory {
  IBundleHeaderValidator create(IFile manifest);

  String markerType();

}
```
that should be contributed

Line:24, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/builders/IBundleHeaderValidator.java -> Maybe the markertype could just be an attribute of the extension point?

A BiConsumer<IHeader, IValidationResult> might be more convenient so the implementation do not net to create lists/maps/... 

Maybe the Map<...> could be better replaced by a Function<String, IHeader> or should we support the case where the HeaderName is unknown in advance and one likes to cycle through all headers?

Because header names are case insensitive, at laest it should be clear that the Map is

a) either case insensitive regarding keys
b) what the expected case is (always uppercase?)

yes, it could be, but we may need it in API anyway

> A BiConsumer<IHeader, IValidationResult> might be more convenient so the implementation do not net to create lists/maps/... 

good point, but I would vote for declaring out own interface extends BiConsumer<IHeader, IValidationResult>

> Maybe the Map<...> could be better replaced by a Function<String, IHeader> or should we support the case where the HeaderName is unknown in advance and one likes to cycle through all headers?

yes, map could be replaced the something more flexible

Line:24, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/builders/IBundleHeaderValidator.java -> What's the benefit of the IBundleHeaderValidatorFactory?
VirtualMarker can't be part of the API and neither should the extension manage its own markers to avoid performance issues.

> Maybe the markertype could just be an attribute of the extension point?

sure

this map is case-insensitive, and yes that needs to documented. I don't understand how a BiConsumer or Function helps here though. Why do we need to abstract a Map?

I just thought of that most of (if not all) methods of Map are of less use (e.g. one can't modify the Map for sure and so on), and the user would mostly call 'Map.get(NameOfheader)' and thus Function String->Header would support this with minimal internals exposure (e.g. if (for whatever reason) later on not a map but a different data-structure is used).

Line:24, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/builders/IBundleHeaderValidator.java -> Ok, I see. A map would be helpful if someone needs to validate dynamic header keys (like iterating over all headers with a given prefix).
Other than that I think exposing the manifest as a Map is the easiest option for consumers to understand while leaving PDE enough freedom.

Line:27, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/builders/IHeader.java -> this line number seems zero based and is incremented basically by every caller.

We should change that before publication.

Line:27, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/core/builders/IHeader.java -> If i remember right, Markers uses "one based" line numbers where as generic-editor/jface uses "zero based" line numbers.

If you are willing to change here something like org.eclipse.jface.text.IRegion or similar that combines offset+length more suitable?

maybe  int getLineNumber(); / int getLinesSpan(); could even be considers to be "non API" as I can't really think about any usecase where this would be relevant for the validation

That's probably the origin of this design. Anyway, since this interface is focused on validation it seems only correct to use marker oriented concepts (and a zero-based linen number is weird IMHO...).

I don't think providing the IRegion would help. You can't do much without the corresponding document right?

Line:63, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/builders/JarManifestErrorReporter.java -> This is the only usage of IHeader::getLinesSpan. Maybe we should expose it as IHeader.getLineNumber(ManifestElement)?
Christoph, for your usecase it doesn't seem relevant. Alexander, would you need something like this?

If not, we can always add it later. We're free to add new API to IHeader after all.
