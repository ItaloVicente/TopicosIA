I think you should. The update code will not compile with an earlier version.

That is a good problem to have. :-)

Julian, based on Jens feedback I think you can merge this one.

I've already found that better API.

Since I probably won't be the last guy applying that naive migration... Should that "untyped" API like WidgetProperties.selection() even exist?

That's a good point. Maybe not. Good thing that you though about it.

The typed version of WidgetProperties was created in a hurry as an exact copy of the existing class. I have not had time to think about if some changes could be make to it, given that it doesn't need to be backwards compatible.

I'll spend some time on it in the weekend.
