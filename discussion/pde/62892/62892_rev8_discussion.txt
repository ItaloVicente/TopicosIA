DESCRIPTION:

Bug 453392 - No debug options help

- added support for showing tracing options comments 
extracted from .options file in tracing tab of PDE launch config
- there is simple custom parser to do that. Properties object does
not support comments and there is no way to override it to get a hold of
comments. The other option would be to use apache code but it is
probably unwanted dependency
- comments simply added as "invalid" keys in properties object such as
#key with value of the comment, presentation layer gets them and show in
form of label on top of control (see bug for more UI options)

The changes look good. However I have these comments.

1) The license year of all changed file should be updated to 2016
2) Any specific reason for removing FileNotFoundException block in 
TracingOptionsManager::getOptions
3) In private class BooleanEditor, there is unnecessary commented code
// private Label commentLabel;


Also as per comment#30, we need to have another bug.

Btw why you not commenting on the code itself? Would have been easier to find.
1) Ok. Takes so long to review this stuff year changed!
2) Because FileNotFoundException is subclass of IOException and they have same handing block, no point duplication code
3) ok
