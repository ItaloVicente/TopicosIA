DESCRIPTION:

Pre Bug 570956 - minor refactoring & fix Exception if project is closed

Refactor ApiAnalysisApplication.importProject() to improve readability
and unncessary modification of a project's build-spec.

Also avoid an potential CoreException if project exists but is
closed. After the check for existence the project's location was checked
but the doc of IProject.getDescriptor() states that it throws a
"
CoreException - if this method fails. Reasons include:
- This project does not exist.
- This project is not open.
"
Now the location is checked after the project is (definitive) open.
