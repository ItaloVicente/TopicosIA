DESCRIPTION:

Bug 569905 - inject missing BREE based on project's JRE

When no Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment is specified, matching
system packages from all execution environments will satisfy the import.
When building against Java 11, e.g an Import-Package: javax.annotation
may be resolved with the JavaSE-8 execution environment instead of an
javax.annotation bundle, causing compile errors because that bundle
won't be added to the classpath.

This change injects an BREE based on the project's JRE into the manifest
provided to the OSGi state if the manifest doesn't declare one.
