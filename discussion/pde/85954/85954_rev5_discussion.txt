DESCRIPTION:

Bug 507947 - Provide generic editor extension for .target files

First iteration. It supports syntax highlighting on tags, attribute
names and attribute values. Since the target definition file structure
is not API I have supported all the ones I know of.

Auto completion is provided on tags and attribute names. For attribute
values it is provided on unit IDs and versions.

A demo of the features is available on the bug.

The parser was changed to stax. https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/85954/4..5 is the delta between patchset 5 and 4

Thanks. Of course I can have a lock at the delta, but I think it is nicer if the author gives a short feedback, like "all reported issues resolved", so that the reviewer knows all is done, without trying to guess this by looking at 20 file deltas.

I almost always do that. But this time waited for hudson to +1 and got distracted updating my fedora to f25 :)

Change look good to me. I suggest to merge it early M5 so that we have sufficient time to test it. Sopot if you want to have this in M4, please add Vikas as review. He is PDE component lead.

Thanks for the prompt review. I am of the opinion that early M5 is more appropriate.

One other thing that we might need to figure out is the second comment on this gerrit about a potential CQ needed. As far as I can tell from that comment it's something a "project committer" should investigate but if there is anything I can do to help or minimize the delay I am available to help.

Vikas, IMHO a CQ is not needed. Can you make the final decision?

In case it helps decide (hopefully for no CQ), I'm already a committer in various eclipse projects and have also previously contributed some other patches to PDE.
