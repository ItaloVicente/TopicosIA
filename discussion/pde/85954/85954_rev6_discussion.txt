DESCRIPTION:

Bug 507947 - Provide generic editor extension for .target files

First iteration. It supports syntax highlighting on tags, attribute
names and attribute values. Since the target definition file structure
is not API I have supported all the ones I know of.

Auto completion is provided on tags and attribute names. For attribute
values it is provided on unit IDs and versions.

A demo of the features is available on the bug.

The issues mentioned in my last comment are all fixed. I am currently looking at 85954/6. I will update later today if I find any issues.

85954/6 looks ok. 

1) I am not sure if this warrants a separate plugin. And if it does, shouldnt this be added in pde-feature?
2) I will also try to find out if CQ is needed or not

+1 for a new separate plug-in. I personally prefer focused plug-ins.

Any update here?

So if other pde editors has syntax highlighting and autocomplete in generic editor, will we have separate plugins for that too. 
Is that not an overkill?  We could probably have a separate source folder in pde.ui or if the intention is to improve generic editor extended support for other pde editors, we probably need to change the name of the plugin to remove "target".

Currently all pde editors reside in plugin pde.ui.

I will look at CQ issue once we are clear with the code review and structure.

+1 for removing "target". I think we should have one plug-in for generic editor extensions

So do we have an agreement to re-purpose this plug-in for generic editor extensions (by removing 'target' from the title of the plug-in)?

My opinion is that this is a reasonable compromise.
