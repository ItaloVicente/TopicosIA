I've modified your change a bit, to clear the url when the version is removed and also disable the checkbox. Please have a look.

Found two semi-related issues:
1) clearing the version loses viewer selection
2) the outline shows an empty Category Definition node when any feature has no url

Would be great if we can fix at least 1) in 4.12. I'll look into that.

 I'm starting to think that attempts to keep the current implementation style will overload UI even more than now. Looks like the "model" (ISiteFeature impl) should care about sync between ID, Version and URL. But let's postpone the bigger changes for the next cycle.

The problem is SiteFeatureAdapter equals&hashcode , reduced it to just delegate to wrapped feature and this helps.

 > 2) the outline shows an empty Category Definition node when any
 > feature has no url

This is because CategoryOutlinePage ignores "non-valid" ISiteModel 
caused by SiteFeature.isValid() requires url!=null

I'll try to upload the patch, need to understand how to do that for existing change
