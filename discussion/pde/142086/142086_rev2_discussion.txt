The version text itself should have that validation. Also content assist for available version would be nice...
But both can be added later!

My idea was to have a checkbox like "include URL" and if that's selected, auto generate it on version/id changes. The URL itself doesn't need a text box.

> I suggest to connect this flag to "url" attribute existence

Exactly.

It is hard to disagree, all of this will be very nice. I think the mentioned features should be a functionality of PDE Forms base classes, most probably databinding-based.

I suggest to have the URL field read-only, like site editor. From my point it helps to visualize the content

Absolutely!

How about readonly + "include URL" checkbox in same line?

The URL may be quite long. I would prefer to use separate line for checkbox.

OK, but please align it vertically with the text box then.
