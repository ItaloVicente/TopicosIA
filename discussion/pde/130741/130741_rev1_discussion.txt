DESCRIPTION:

Bug 539990 - make problem marker creation incremental

The current error reporting first deletes all markers and recreates
them. This modifies the workspace's element tree and thereby invalidates
the cached delta in BuildManager even if no markers actually change.

This change introduces IncrementalErrorReporter which collects marker
attributes for reported problems and tries to find an existing marker
with equal attributes. If it finds one, the marker is kept and no
changes to the element tree are necessary.

TODO:
1) the change causes the quickfix verification in BuildPropertiesValidationTest to fail for two tests
	- tests now fail, because previously existing markers are actually kept instead of deleting and recreating them
	- verifyQuickFixes() previously ran green even if IMarkerResolution#run was commented out
2) ExtensionPointSchemaBuilder is not yet incremental
3) exception declared by VirtualMarker#setAttribute can be removed
	- I made the signature to match IMarker so that the initial diff of call sites is smaller
4) code duplication between XMLErrorReporter and ErrorReporter can be removed with this change
	
I would like some feedback on the approach before continuing.

In theory this could work. I only wonder if we need some limit from where the compare markers part would take too long (> 10000 markers or files or whatever).

Current approach to "clean all & add" is fast, proposed new "iterate, compare with old, clean one by one and add" could be performance critical on big projects with lot of markers.

I'm not in the JDT business - how they run incremental builds? JDT has way more markers compared with PDE. Is this also "clean all & add" approach?
Line:14, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/builders/IncrementalErrorReporter.java -> This can be any resource, not only file.

JDT also does clean all & add, but they have a similar comparison between new problems and existing markers to count new/fixed errors (BuildNotifier#updateProblemCounts).

I don't think project size would affect performance because marker comparison only processes single resources, so only scales with markers per file. Skipping the delta calculation should by far outweigh the marker comparison on big projects.
