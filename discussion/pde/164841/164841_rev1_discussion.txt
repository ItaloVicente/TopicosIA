Line:105, releng/org.eclipse.pde.ui.setup/PDE.setup -> Do we need this second repository for RedDeer instead of Orbit?

Line:105, releng/org.eclipse.pde.ui.setup/PDE.setup -> Yes, reddeer doesn't come from orbit. Originally there was no orbit repo listed so I assume one isn't needed.

Line:105, releng/org.eclipse.pde.ui.setup/PDE.setup -> OK.
But do we need both "2.9.0" and "latest" RedDeer repos?

Line:105, releng/org.eclipse.pde.ui.setup/PDE.setup -> No, but I'm hoping that the test bundle actually moves the bounds to be able to use a 3.x version so that the 2.9.0 version repo can be removed.  As it currently is, if the bounds are changed, the targlet will still resolve.

I expected with my committer status that I could merge this, but that doesn't appear to be the case.

Could you please merge it?

Perhaps you could merge it and then I'll test the PDE setup in isolation to double check that there are no Orbit things it needs; I expect all the orbit requirement are likely satisfied by the IBuild repo...

I also expected that you already have rights to merge.

>>I expected with my committer status 

On June 10, it says "The Committer election for Ed Merks on project Eclipse Plugin Development
Environment (PDE) (eclipse.pde) has been approved by the PMC (akurtakov)." Based on that, I also expected things to be working for you by now.

We had issues with Andrews permissions in platform as new committer too, this was solved by the foundation via email. I suggest to contact webmaster or emo.
