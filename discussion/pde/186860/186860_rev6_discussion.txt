I have rebased this and the following changes on top of the current master and already addressed the easy to resolve comments.

Roughly speaking I would like to make the addition of requirements available in general via BundleLauncherHelper.getMergedBundleMap() so that the requirements are included if one specifies it (which will be possible with the follow up commit) no matter where this method is called.
On the other hand I would like to place the specification of the requirements into the corresponding LaunchConfigurationDelegates to have the 'specifications' at one place.

To achieve this either an abstract method like getRequirements(ILaunchConfiguration) that is annotated with @noreference could be added to AbstractPDELaunchConfiguration.
Or to not touch the API at all, a static Map<String, Function<ILaunchConfiguration, List<String>>> APPLICATION_REQUIREMENTS could be added where each LaunchConfigDelegeate class can register its requirements in a static block and RequirementHelper.getApplicationRequirements() would then only call the registered function.

Integrating the requirements into getMergedBundleMap sounds reasonable, the application requirements for feature launches are already handled there.

Keep in mind though, that not just the requirements differ between launch config types but also their handling (missing junit bundles are pulled added from the host if missing in workspace and target).

Adding that abstract method is not an option though since AbstractPDELaunchConfiguration may be extended by clients.
