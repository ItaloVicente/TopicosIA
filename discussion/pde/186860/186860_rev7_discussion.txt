> Patch Set 6:
> 
> Integrating the requirements into getMergedBundleMap sounds reasonable, the application requirements for feature launches are already handled there.

That was my main intention also to be able to use it in the sub-sequent change to add applications requirements when adding requirements automatically.

> 
> Keep in mind though, that not just the requirements differ between launch config types but also their handling (missing junit bundles are pulled added from the host if missing in workspace and target).
> 
Thanks for the hint. I already noticed that in the meantime and considered it in this patch set.

> Adding that abstract method is not an option though since AbstractPDELaunchConfiguration may be extended by clients.
Ack. I tried to do this internally now.

I also added some more remarks on the unresolved comments from the previous patch-sets, although some changes have moved to another location.

@Lars from the Milestone-reminder E-Mail I thought code freeze will be tomorrow (Monday) evening? Or is this again a false message?

@Julian, I could be available tomorrow (Monday) morning to work and this and its follow up changes. Actually I wanted them to part of M3, but I was surprised that the stabilization weeks already starts tomorrow. With the M3 at 25th of February I expected it to be one week later.
Or can this still make it into the release after M3?

M3 is this Friday, see the +0 events here https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=gchs7nm4nvpm837469ddj9tjlk@group.calendar.google.com&hl=en 

Because there's almost no time for stabilization after that (RC1 is on the 25th), I suggest to postpone these changes to the next release.

Thanks for the link.
I was looking at the SimRel Wiki page: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Category:SimRel-2022-03
which says:
2022-03 M3 	Friday, February 25, 2022 	02/18 to 02/25

Therefore I assumed that the code-freeze period would be from the 18th to the 25th.
It would be great if that plan would be more clear in that regard.

OK, then lets postpone it.

SimRel M3 is indeed published next week, but Platform needs to publish a week before (-> +0) so that dependending projects can build upon that (-> +1..3)

And therefore the milestone week of platform starts five days before M3+0, right? Now I understand it. Thanks for the explanation. With that I'm hopefully not surprised anymore in the future.
