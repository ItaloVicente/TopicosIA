1) When I put 1200 as Images per page and then click on Next Page, Images per page changes to 120.
Also we need to think what happens if total images is 1400 and image per page is 1200 and user clicks page 3. I think in such scenarios once the calculation is done, only Previous Page 1 2 Next Page should be shown. I think initially 
Previous Page 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page is ok but once next page is clicked and it is realized that 2nd page is last page, we can change it to Previous Page 1 2 Next Page.

This end condition should be corrected.


2) Also when Previous Page 4 5 6 7 8 Next Page is shown, 6 should be highlighted for symmetric reasons but this is not mandatory. Even the current implementation is good. If to maintain symmetric, we need to do 2 page calculation after the current page, that is not good. So I am OK with this change.

1) Current max page set for 999, nothing to do with patch, I think control just cuts off extra 0's because it over the limit
1.5) I cannot correct end condition without jeopardizing performance,
I already said - it is lazy. I show 5 pages by default. When it realized there is no more pages, it will show exact number, if we attempt to calculate this in advance we just waste lots of time requesting stuff just for cosmetics
2) Same thing, to make it symmetric I have to know that we have at least two pages in advance, but we don't. It is better to show pages we know about, which are previous pages, rather then guessing. The only guess is for first 5 pages, which is always shows 5 until it knows.

It is images per page and not page number. Infact it accepts 1200 as images per page and only when next is pressed, that number is trimmed to 120. That looks odd. I agree with rest of your comments regarding performance.

Yes images per page. If you open version without my fix it should be the same. Size of control is set to 999, spinner does that if user types value which is higher then max. Please open another bug about it
