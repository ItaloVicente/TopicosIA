The changes  works well. There are no memory issues. Code looks good.

However my suggestions

1) UI changes
However Max and Page doesn't look intuitive. So I propose.
1) Images Per Page  ( instead of Max)
Also a tooltip for that: Maximum number of images on a page.
2) Page No.  ( instead of Page)
Also a tooltip for that: Select the page number to view the images on that page.   

2) License year in ImageBrowserView should be changed to 2016
4) Few places in ImageBrowserView  has unnecessary line breaks.

The labels are too long, I changed it to Max because original was too long. These controls are on tool bar, implementing what you suggestion will make toolbar take at least two lines. I can fix tooltips and make tooltips as long and as explanatory as needed, but toolbar labels should be as short as possible. Come to think about it if we have pagination now there is no need to change number of images. I cannot imagine scenario where this is necessary. If I remove this then we can make Page label longer too.
