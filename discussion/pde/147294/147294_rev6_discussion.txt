DESCRIPTION:

WIP - Bug 549892 - Improve progress reporting during PDE launch

Calling isCanceled in
ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/EclipseApplicationLaunchConfiguration.java
feels like overdesign, as two lines later split() is called.
Removes frequent progress reporting in the clearWorkspace method which
is not visible the user.
Prefer usage of split rather than the combination of worked and
isCanceled

@Lars several isCancelled checks has been removed without replacement that changes the control flow
Line:146, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/util/CoreUtility.java -> The isCancelled check is removed without replacement from here

Line:104, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/LauncherUtils.java -> Control flow is changed here. CoreException with IStatus.CANCEL is needed to keep the control flow

Line:124, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/LauncherUtils.java -> Control flow is changed here. CoreException with IStatus.CANCEL is needed to keep the control flow

Line:139, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/LauncherUtils.java -> Control flow is changed here. There was a isCancelled check and CoreException with IStatus.CANCEL is needed to keep the control flow

Line:169, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/EclipseApplicationLaunchConfiguration.java -> Control flow is changed here. See the comments to LaunchUtil

Line:475, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/JUnitLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> Control flow is changed here. See the comments to LaunchUtils

Line:477, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/JUnitLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> Control flow is changed here. isCancelled check removed without replacement

Line:198, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/ui/launcher/EquinoxLaunchConfiguration.java -> Control flow is changed here. isCancelled check removed without replacement

I need to check your comments but the intention is to remove isCanceled in cases in which we shortly afterwards call split() as split also checks for cancellation to avoid cancellation check overhead.

Only commented on part of your comments as they repeat, please see and let me know that you think.
Line:146, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/util/CoreUtility.java -> One line later we call split so the call is redundant.

Line:139, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/LauncherUtils.java -> Se call split which does a cancel check.

Line:146, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/util/CoreUtility.java -> OK, in this case probably it is even better: instead of returning from sub-call we will throw OperationCancelledException
The caller should be ready for this.

Line:139, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/LauncherUtils.java -> Yes, the check will be done. And it will throw unchecked exception instead of returning from this method. It is OK if caller is ready for this.

Line:146, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/util/CoreUtility.java -> Yes, we did through an exception also before.

Line:104, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/LauncherUtils.java -> I don't think the old logic was correct. If the user cancels, I think we should through a OperationCanceledException

Line:139, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/launching/launcher/LauncherUtils.java -> I think it is.
