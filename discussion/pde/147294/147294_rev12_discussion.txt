DESCRIPTION:

Bug 549892 - Improve progress reporting during PDE launch

Calling isCanceled in
ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/EclipseApplicationLaunchConfiguration.java
feels like overdesign, as two lines later split() is called.
Removes frequent progress reporting in the clearWorkspace method which
is not visible the user.
Prefer usage of split rather than the combination of worked and
isCanceled
