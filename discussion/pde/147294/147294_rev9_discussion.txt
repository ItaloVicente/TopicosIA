DESCRIPTION:

Bug 549892 - Improve progress reporting during PDE launch

Calling isCanceled in
ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/EclipseApplicationLaunchConfiguration.java
feels like overdesign, as two lines later split() is called.
Removes frequent progress reporting in the clearWorkspace method which
is not visible the user.
Prefer usage of split rather than the combination of worked and
isCanceled

Line:139, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/util/CoreUtility.java -> I think the whol SubMonitor conversion and usage could be moved within the if block.

Line:145, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/util/CoreUtility.java -> I dislike the logic here, esp. I think it can be avoided to use setWorkRemaining.

When the file is a directory, the SubMonitor could be created here with the number of children (check that children.length > 0). Each recursive call of deleteContent() could then just consume 1 tick.

   SubMonitor subMon = SubMonitor.convert(monitor, children.length);
   deleteContent(element, subMon.split(1));

Line:154, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/util/CoreUtility.java -> I'd prefer done() here. This eats up all remaining work, too.

Originally, done() was called on the passed in monitor. This is not the case anymore. Is it guaranteed that done() is called somewhere up in the call stack on the monitor?

Line:162, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/EclipseApplicationLaunchConfiguration.java -> You could also just use '2' and split '1' each here. Matter of taste.

Line:482, ui/org.eclipse.pde.launching/src/org/eclipse/pde/launching/JUnitLaunchConfigurationDelegate.java -> how about 'else { worked(25); }' instead.
Or call done().

I don't like manipulating the remaining work.

Line:450, ui/org.eclipse.pde.ui/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/ui/search/dependencies/AddNewDependenciesOperation.java -> unrelated change

MISMATCHED INLINE COMMENT
Line:154, ui/org.eclipse.pde.core/src/org/eclipse/pde/internal/core/util/CoreUtility.java -> That is the contract, so done should be called. If not that is an error.
