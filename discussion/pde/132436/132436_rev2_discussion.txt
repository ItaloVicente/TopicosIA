Fixed both files as best as I could, both already had a few lines with different endings as the rest of the file...

I guess those are mistakes and core.autocrlf true is recommended?

Some files in PDE uses incorrect line endings, the projects are set to use Unix (which is correct) but some files use Windows line endings. I suggest converting these files in a separate commit. AFAIK, unfortunately, it is not possible to have this setting on the project and not use it if you modify a file.
