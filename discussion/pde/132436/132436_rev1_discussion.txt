Can you elaborate on both points?

It is a matter of taste what is "better":

list.size() > 0 or !list.isEmpty()

Sonar decided that the right side is better, nice for them, but for me both are just same, even more: negation is harder to read.

As said, it makes no sense because it is purely matter of taste.

To the second point: got to the platform UI repository (where we have all those refactorings behind us, unfortunately), and try to find out with git blame on one from such files who introduced this particular check on this particular line and why.

After this refactoring it will say - "the monster commit to make Sonar happy".

This is bad.

It will NOT say "this line was added by commit XYZ which fixed bug #ABC". So effectively you kill the git blame, which is, unfortunately, the only source in many places documenting WHY the code looks like it is.

Personally I disagree on the readability, but OK.

That effectively prevents any refactoring. When I run blame on our codebase, most times a line was last changed because someone indented it by wrapping an if around it. That you can't get to the original change with one blame seems natural to me in an old codebase.

I get that you're trying to prevent that for trivial changes like this, but is there some threshold were you consider a refactoring worth that?

Andrey, I (as a PMC member trying to grow the community) am really disappointed to see such comments coming from committers.
First of all, even if it's "personal preference" for most collections it is not for all of them. And while one can call it just "noise" I doubt that anyone will go and check whether size()>0 or isEmpty is used when converting from one collection to another. Thus moving to isEmpty improves the future-proof of the code.
Second, git history while valuable means nothing if there are not enough people to read it. That's why it is unacceptable to turn down contribution in that way. Every chance to grow the contributor base should be taken as this what makes a project live longer.
Third, this is abuse of Gerrit "-2" which is ment to be for "incorrect/buggy/broken" patches which I don't see any proof about in the comments other than one person preferences vs. another.
Summary: Please no longer turn down contributions in that way and even if it's not your personal preference don't ruin the effort done by others to find more people working on the project (unless you can easily take times more work!).

If the code change is functional, it is OK to refector. Here the code change is just "style", and also a huge one.

The code change hides entire line from git blame, not just the method name.

These are orthogonal, one is not related in any way to another. Same way you can also argue the code quality means nothing if there are not enough people to read it, so let us do whatever we want to attract more people.

If you would check gerrit, I'm the one most active reviewer on the platform, and I *enforce* good contributions. I don't "take down" people just because I can, and if I put -2 I have a reason to do that.

It is not abuse. You ignore the most important part - git blame, and this is not a matter of taste. I spend most of my time maintaining others people code & git blame is the fastest and best way to understand the history of the code. Seeing "converted to lambdas" or "replaced x through y because Sonar" all the time makes my work extremely hard, and this means the those few people working on the code need to spend even more time to fix *real* problems.

You can't say I "ruin" anyone's efforts just because I have good reasons to put a -2 on the patch. If the patch is not good, I have no reason to blindly accept it just to make the contributor happy.

I've reviewed and accepted *real* fixes from Julian, which needed some more thinking (not just cleanups):

https://git.eclipse.org/r/130625
https://git.eclipse.org/r/130741
https://git.eclipse.org/r/127783

... and I used git blame to understand the code.

If you compare how many patches Julian contributed and how many of them were reviewed, you will see that exact the half of them are reviewed by me:

https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/owner:julian.honnen%2540vector.com+status:merged

https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/q/owner:julian.honnen%2540vector.com+status:merged+reviewer:"Andrey+Loskutov+%253Closkutov%2540gmx.de%253E"

Summary: please accept that git blame is very important for code maintenance, and that my -2 on this patch is not a matter of taste.

In this case there is only one path forward: Please bring the issue to Eclipse PMC mailing list for discussion and decision there how/what the project should value more.
