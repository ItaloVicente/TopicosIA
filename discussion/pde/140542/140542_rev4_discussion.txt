Somehow that gerrit build got lost and the change is already up to date so I can't rebase... So we need to change something ;)

Can you add a minimum size to both areas? The top one should be at least as high as the buttons.

@Julian
Currently the top one has 
		gd.heightHint = 250;
Do you think we need to change this?
I can see that you created https://git.eclipse.org/r/#/c/140738/ . Do you plan to merge it before this one?

That hint doesn't seem to apply for a minimum height, I can resize it to 0 pixels.

IMO a minimum height is nice to have, not required for this change. If you don't find a simple solution (preferably without hardcoding a pixel height for those buttons), just skip it.

Yes. A separate bug for the workaround is better, I think.

Yes, now I see.

I found "[SashForm] SashForm doesn't respect minimum sizes when resizing"
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=195825

OK, let's repair tests first, it is more important for now. And then, I hope, this one can go forward.
