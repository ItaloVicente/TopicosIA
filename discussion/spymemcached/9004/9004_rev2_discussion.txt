Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I like where this is going, but I'm not sure about the exception handling here.  It looks clean for the consumer of the API, but I'm a bit confused looking here internally.
Line:107, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/couch/HttpOperationImpl.java -> something here doesn't seem right.  You're now throwing an org.apache.http.ParseException, as a result of bad JSON.   Though above, when you catch the same thing, you say it's bad http headers.  I know there's no direct link there, but just seeing all of this in the same patchset makes me wonder if the exception path is pretty clear.

What is ParseException really supposed to mean in this class?  We're returning it to other protected-level callers potentially.

Line:32, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/couch/ViewOperationImpl.java -> now we're back to java.text.ParseException

Line:107, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/couch/HttpOperationImpl.java -> This looks confusing because of the skipped lines. Take a look at the entire file and let me know if you still have questions.

Line:32, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/couch/ViewOperationImpl.java -> See my other comment. This is the right exception to throw here.
