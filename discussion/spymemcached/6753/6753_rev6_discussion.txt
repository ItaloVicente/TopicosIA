Patch Set 6: Verified

No more asyncTouch(), just touch(), but it's async.

Patch Set 6: Looks good to me, approved

The tests are blocked on another change.  I believe they exist, but this code looks pretty good so far.

I think there's something to be said for consistency in naming the method.  I don't mind having asyncTouch() and no touch().  Right now, people familiar with the API may assume think touch() is synchronous even when it isn't.  I suggest putting it back.

Well, set is async now.  That's the original sin of inconsistency I was thinking about.  Given both are inconsistent, my vote would be for the smaller one.  I don't have a huge amount of care, though.

That's more of a 3.0 thing -- where we actually break the API.

Line:72, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/AsciiOperationFactory.java -> This should have a message indicating why it's unsupported.  Simply saying touch is a binary protocol only operation would be sufficient.  Would save someone a lot of hassle.

I think keeping it like set makes sense.  I don't think application developers generally are going to really care about waiting for the touch to finish, but it'll be possible.

Having asyncSet and asyncTouch would make sense in building out a new API.  It's a mistake, but I do think this is consistent in spirit.

Blair, do you think it's OK to go with this, or do you feel strongly that it should be asyncTouch?

I see your argument for naming it touch() to be consistent with the async set().  I don't feel strongly about the naming, though.
