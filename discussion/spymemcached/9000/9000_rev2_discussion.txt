Line:1, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/HttpFuture.java -> if this will now be a class the user expects to get, does it belong in the "internal" package?  It's possible it does, I seem to recall other things being in there, but I don't know if that's a  mistake or intent.

Line:1, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/ViewFuture.java -> I guess this is internal too...

Line:1, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/HttpFuture.java -> internal is the correct package. GetFuture, OperationFuture, and ImmediateFuture are all in there as well.

Line:1, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/internal/ViewFuture.java -> My implementation is correct here. See my other comment on this patch set
