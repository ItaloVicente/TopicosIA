DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Only connect when not already connecting.

This changeset should solve the potential issue of connecting
to a server while its still trying to connect. This may be triggered
by lots of reconfigurations going on at the same time.

It uses a thread-safe set to manage the currently connecting nodes.

Patch Set 2:

Fixed the log message.

I'm not sure I completely follow with the synchronized.. I tried to orientate around the nodesToShutdown, which are also concurrent but aren't used down the file with syncronization. Lets sync  (;)) up on this soon.
