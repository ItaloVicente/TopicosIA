No tests?  Current binary tests can cover this with minor modifications.

A few minor things in here.
Line:46, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CASResponse.java -> why -1?  Is null perhaps better?

Line:48, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CASResponse.java -> It'd be good to guard against allowing this to be mutated.  Set it only if it's -1, and otherwise throw illegal arg.  Might save you from a hard to find bug someday.

Line:51, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CASResponse.java -> at a minimum, I'd expect some javadoc here.  the other question is what is the behavior in the case of ascii protocol.

Line:567, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> Wrong code style, instead of this=that should be this = that with spaces on either side of the =, right?
