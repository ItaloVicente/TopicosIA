Is it necessary to have the jars in the repository?  Isn't it possible to just have this as documented toolchain?

Also, we seem to have Ivy 2.0.0 rc2.  The current version on the site is 2.2.0!
Line:4, etc/checkstyle-noframes.xsl -> This appears to be just dropped in.  why are we applying our copyright to it?

Line:24, ivy.xml -> is this right?  Couchbase copyright header but organization org.apache with module couchsqoop?  This sounds like maven metadata.

Line:28, ivy/ivysettings.xml -> this repo is deprecated.  should be replaced with http://files.couchbase.com/maven2

property name looks wrongish too

Line:27, ivy/spymemcached.xml -> This line is inconsistent with itself!  :)

One of the jars you mentioned doesn't need to be there. The other jars though are used by the build file and I would hate to have people need to go and download jars and put them into the lib folder just to use the build file. In the future I will try to make this more automated, but for now I don't think we should worry about it too much.
Line:4, etc/checkstyle-noframes.xsl -> I just applied our copyright header to every file in the project. I can remove it if you want, but I think it's more consistent this way.

Line:24, ivy.xml -> I obviously copied a bunch of this stuff from my last project.

Line:28, ivy/ivysettings.xml -> Done

Line:27, ivy/spymemcached.xml -> Done
