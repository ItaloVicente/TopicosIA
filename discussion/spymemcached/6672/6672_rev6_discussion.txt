There are some minor formatting issues and use of final where it don't make any sense (at least to my knowledge).. I think we're better off getting the stuff in and fix the formatting and finalizing as separate commits later on (and perhaps some documentation....)

I'd still like to get some minor fixes in here.  At the very least, a compile fix.
Line:92, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/ConfigurationParserJSON.java -> This doesn't compile.  Should just be create()
