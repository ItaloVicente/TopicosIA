DESCRIPTION:

Encode with commons codec more correctly.

Apache Commons Codec had introduced a change in 1.4 that had it
inadvertantly adding extra CRLF to encode responses.  We had worked
around this issue when writing the initial HTTP authorization
code, but it turns out commons codec has reverted to the behavior
in 1.3 with the release of 1.5.

This change updates commons codec, adds a test to verify correct
behavior, and addresses potential error handling issues with the
character set.
