DESCRIPTION:

Make sure the selector wakes up when no operations is going
through the Connection.

This can lead to an issue when no traffic is going through the
system that a newly added node does not get properly included
in the cluster landscape on the client side.

This has no effect if there is already going traffic through
the system.
