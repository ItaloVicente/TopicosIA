DESCRIPTION:

SPY-111: Check if the node belongs to cluster before connect.

This changeset makes sure a node belongs to the cluster (by
verifying against the node locator), before trying to (re)-
connect. This helps in situations where a node is scheduled
for shutdown and therfore not part of the cluster, but is
still alive and may be connectable. In this case, it will
result in NPE or AssertionExceptions down the stack.

Line:380, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> Will we never end up back in here more than once?  I just worry that our IO thread will potentially have data unread, and the selecton key will still be "ready".  I don't know NIO that well though.  each belongsToCluster() invocation will be a walk of a hashmap though.

Line:60, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnectionTest.java -> what about testing the negative case?

Line:380, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> this will only run when it actually tries to connect. sk.isConnectable() returns false when connected and therefore it never reaches belongstocluster().

Line:60, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnectionTest.java -> jup, need to add it.
