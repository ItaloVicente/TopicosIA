DESCRIPTION:

SPY-111: Check if the node belongs to cluster before connect.

This changeset makes sure a node belongs to the cluster (by
verifying against the node locator), before trying to (re)-
connect. This helps in situations where a node is scheduled
for shutdown and therfore not part of the cluster, but is
still alive and may be connectable. In this case, it will
result in NPE or AssertionExceptions down the stack.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, approved

I'd feel better if that belongsToCluster() had a test, just to possibly catch issues if there were unexpected internal changes.

This doesn't seem to fix the issue we are trying to address.
Please have another look.
