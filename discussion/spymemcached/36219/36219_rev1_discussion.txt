DESCRIPTION:

Pending Verification: Widen Listener lock to avoid deadlock

Motivation
----------
Because of how the addListener and notifyListener works, it could be that
one deadlocks each other because they are waiting on the same locks from
different threads.

Modifications
-------------
The lock is widened to a method-wide synchronization to avoid potential
inner-method deadlocks.

Result
------
Since the lock is widened, there should be no inner deadlocks anymore.

I'm sure like you I'd feel better with a test that demonstrates the fix in the situation encountered, but I don't see any harm here.

definitely. I tried to reproduce it some time ago when it was reported on google code, but no luck. That's why I was "happy" that we saw it here again.
