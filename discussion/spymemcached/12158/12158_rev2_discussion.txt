DESCRIPTION:

Added a tap client back to Spymemcached

The tap client was removed from Spymemcached when we split the
project in two. Since Spymemcached supports some of tap I have
moved back only the code that makes sense. After this commit
Spymemcached will support only the tap dump command. Note I
have also left the tap custom function in case future versions
of memcached support more tap options and Spymemcached is unable
to keep up. This tapCustom function will also allow people who
write their own engines for memcached to take full advantage of
the tap protocol.
