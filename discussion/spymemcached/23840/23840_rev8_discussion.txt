DESCRIPTION:

Verify connections are sound before completing them entirely.

Without this change, the client considers the connection to be
good any time a connection has been established.  This is not the
case in some critical situations, such as a hung process or a very
busy remote server.

Solution is to ping the server with a version op, since that can happen
before auth, and use that as a way to verify the thing is actually
alive.

Note there is also a refactoring in here renaming the variable for
the node.

(4 inline comments)

Minor comments herein, and I want to check the node.connected() before the +2.

Great work!
Line:385, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> This refactoring can be undone now that you're doing it differently above.

Line:406, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> I was reluctant to do that, because the comments indicate it's from observation, but it may be safe.  I'll verify.

Line:412, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> Oh, duh.  I see what the previous problem was.

Line:416, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> System.nanoTime() is pretty expensive, but has advantages.  We may want to see if there's a better way.
