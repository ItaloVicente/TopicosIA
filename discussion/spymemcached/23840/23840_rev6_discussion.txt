DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Verify connections are sound before completing them entirely.

Without this change, the client considers the connection to be
good any time a connection has been established.  This is not the
case in some critical situations, such as a hung process or a very
busy remote server.

Solution is to ping the server with a version op, since that can happen
before auth, and use that as a way to verify the thing is actually
alive.

Note there is also a refactoring in here renaming the variable for
the node.
