DESCRIPTION:

WIP: Verify connections are sound before completing them entirely.

Without this change, the client considers the connection to be
good any time a connection has been established.  This is not the
case in some critical situations, such as a hung process or a very
busy remote server.

Solution is to ping the server with a noop, since that can happen
before auth, and use that as a way to verify the thing is actually
alive.

Patch Set 1: Do not submit

This doesn't work currently.

I *just* found out that noop may not work for this.  Either we filter out ascii, or we use the version command instead.
