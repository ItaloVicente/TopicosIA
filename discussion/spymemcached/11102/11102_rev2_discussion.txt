Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I don't understand this one.  Maybe a better commit message would help me understand it.

It seems the goal here is to install the -test artifacts to the local maven repo, but I don't know why I'd want to do that.

Patch Set 2:

CouchbaseClient relies on having the tests from Spymemcached. For example MembaseClient extends BinaryClientTest. As a result we need to create separate "test" jars since we don't want to incude tests in the normal distribution.
