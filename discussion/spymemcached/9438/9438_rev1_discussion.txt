DESCRIPTION:

Change getBytes() to getData() in CASOperation

The getBytes function was incorrectly named in the CASOperation
class for two reasons. First the function actually gets the
data field from a message so getData() is a better name. Second,
in the StoreOperation class and other classes the name of the
function is getData() so this improves consistency. This issue
was notice when I was looking at the StoreOperation and saw that
this class had two different functions that did exactly the same
thing.
