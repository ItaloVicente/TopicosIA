DESCRIPTION:

SPY-123: Fix Race Condition that kills IO Thread

This changeset makes sure that a potential race condition when
adding/removing nodes the same time does not kill the IO thread.
The Exception is caught and the code block is tried again.

Also, as a safety net, the IO thread at the topmost level catches
this error and proceeds, since this type of exception is considered
to be transient and does not persist.
