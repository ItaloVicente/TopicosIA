DESCRIPTION:

SPY-123: Fix Race Condition that kills IO Thread

This changeset makes sure that a potential race condition when
adding/removing nodes the same time does not kill the IO thread.
The Exception is caught and the code block is tried again.

Also, as a safety net, the IO thread at the topmost level catches
this error and proceeds, since this type of exception is considered
to be transient and does not persist.

I'll proactively +2 this, but please consider changing the log level.
Line:269, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> Shouldn't we log this at the "warning" level?  It's not an expected condition, but it's not an error condition.

Line:269, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> Also, I'd consider logging the thread ID.  Maybe that's logged by default?

Line:269, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> That depends on the logger that we use.. log4j, and such do it automatically, our default logger doesnt.. so lets keep this in style with the other messages and let the logger impl do it!

Line:269, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedConnection.java -> Hmm, I thought about it, but warning looks a little bit "harsh" to me? But maybe its okay, lets just do warnings it shouldnt come up very often and maybe it points to other issues some time later
