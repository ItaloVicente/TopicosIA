DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-070: Fix Authentication to non-default bucket

Authentication to newly connected nodes
was happening in the wrong order on the jcbc
side.

The KetamaNodeLocator was not updating the Node
list that was obtained by getAll().

There were other issues in the code that have
been corrected with some defensive
programming.

Manual test for the fix is included. Following
the directions in readme.txt and executing the
scripts (or something along those lines) would
recreate the issue/fix.
