Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I don't think this is correct.  The guard in here is for things that are below 0, which means the connection has been closed.  Then you would want to reconnect.

Is there a particular problem you're trying to fix here?  Perhaps there is a bug number or a test that should be part of this?

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

I realized later that tap dump expects the connection to be closed, so anything with a 0 should be okay.
