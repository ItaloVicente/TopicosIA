Patch Set 2:

it WAS broken indeed *phew*.

its fixed now, but there is still one thing left: how do we handle asyncMutate with default in ascii? no default supported there.

with sync its really sync done, here I'd need to go great length to async chain them together ...

OperationNotSupportedException is probably the best bet if we can't do it.  It's something that would be found very early-- at development time.
