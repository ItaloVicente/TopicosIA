DESCRIPTION:

Increase the maximum size allowed.  Issue 106.

Though memcached still has a 1MiB size by default (overridable
with a flag), other engines may have their own maximum.  Membase
for instance has a 20MiB maximum.

Note that the size enforced by the transcoder can be overridden
through it's ctor.  The reason for making this change is to
create a new, larger default.

At least for the remainder of the 2.6 series, rather than do
deep surgery on this issue, just bump up the maximum.

Line:16, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/CachedData.java -> the ctor allows a dynamic.  I was just 'fixing' the code.
