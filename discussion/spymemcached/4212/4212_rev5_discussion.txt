DESCRIPTION:

Add a TIMEDOUT state to ops and make callbacks correct.

There would be some situations where the latch would not expire
due to the callback not having been called.  Callbacks were
typically called on state transition for the operation, so I
thought it appropriate to add a TIMEDOUT state.
