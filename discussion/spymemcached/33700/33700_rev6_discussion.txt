DESCRIPTION:

SPY-154: Also RETRY on binary NMVB response with bulk gets.

This changeset makes sure that even when one of the individual get
operations in the bulk request fails with a "Not My VBucket", the
single get operation gets retried.

To make this work, the underlying bulk operation is changed slightly
to be notified that it has to wait for N more operations before
notifying the listeners and counting down the latch.

Change-Id: I6413233a3d0289ab728312f8f4edab5df96a0081

Line:1342, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> I hope there will never be one, I just thought its more failure-safe if we ever run into it, and we can notify then anyway.
