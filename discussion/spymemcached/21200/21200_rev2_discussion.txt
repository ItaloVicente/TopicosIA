we add the ability to get stats from the replica vbuckets
later.

Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

Approving given that the test is on the other side.
Line:54, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/KeyStatsOperationImpl.java -> More readable to use one of the Arrays methods these days, but this is fine.

Line:57, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/KeyStatsOperationImpl.java -> Are they guaranteed to be UTF-8?  I guess this is okay.  Would it be better to catch and log if we can't convert here though?

Line:57, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/KeyStatsOperationImpl.java -> This is the same code as the normal stats call so I am going to leave it that same for now. If we fix it it should be done in both places.
