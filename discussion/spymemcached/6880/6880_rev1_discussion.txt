Line:139, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> Looks like this can be final.

Line:1765, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> This pattern of breaking down keys into groups looks common, should be refactored into a new method.

Line:10, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/BinaryClientTest.java -> Looks like lots of other whitespace changes here.

Line:139, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> I've got an eclipse setting that just does that on save.  I still strongly believe that things are better when you need to justify making things mutable.

Line:139, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> +1.

Should we discuss on the group mailing list to get everyone on the same page?

Line:139, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> I think there are a few areas that could use some design correction and this is something I consider to be an important design principle.

We'll probably start some work there soon, but it might be just a bit too soon since we're finishing up some stuff here.  That is, I'd like to talk about it, but few of us have the time in the next week or two to really engage properly.

I'm going to be abandoning this change because I don't want it to be dependent on the tap code (since it isn't). All of your comments will be addressed in the new commit.
Line:139, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> Done

Line:1765, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> Good point, but I think this should go into another commit. I'll add it to my list.

Line:10, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/BinaryClientTest.java -> Don't know what happened here, both sides look the same to me. I'll have this fixed in the next commit.
