Patch Set 2: Do not submit

While binary keys may work, it's not clear if this is intended to work.  We're checking on that.  For now, marking this -2.

Just sent another email to a wide variety of folks on this.  It's not been forgotten, but we don't know the answer yet as to what the server should support.

Chris, that linked discussion wasn't quite all of the discussion.  I was still driving part of it.  Will update soon.

I'd like Michael N. to give this a +2 review.

We've resolved all of the outstanding issues for this to go in though.  Here's how it breaks down:
- We expect this to be fine with all key/value use cases in Couchbase Server 2.0
- We strongly recommend users select keys which are valid UTF-8 such that they can be used in views.  This is valid even with \0, \n, \r, " ", etc.
- Couchbase Server 2.0 does not have any known issues with the above, but some areas like Cross Datacenter Replication, backup and restore, statistics utilities have not been fully tested and could have unknown issues.  Any issues will be fixed with subsequent fixes in the 2.0.x release line.

I think we want to have this bundled with the 1.1 release!
