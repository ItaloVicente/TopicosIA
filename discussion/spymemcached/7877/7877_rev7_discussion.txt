DESCRIPTION:

Issue 96: ClassPathException fix

The issue here was that we were combinding multiple types of
get operations in the same class, but each operation would
have a different Callback type. When we would go to optimize
get operations it would optimize get, getl, gat, and gets
operations and since they have different callback types we
would throw an exception.

Each operation now has its own class.

Don't fret the misspelling.
Line:9, /COMMIT_MSG -> I think you mean combining.  Sorry I didn't catch this one the last time around.
