DESCRIPTION:

Fixes to testSyncGetTimeouts.

Previous to enforcing the timeouts at an operation level, this test
would pass.  In fact, Dustin said the test had never failed before.

However, it turns out that the really short default timeouts would
be too short and not waiting a bit after encountering a timeout would
still see timeouts.

Line:567, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/ProtocolBaseCase.java -> In other test classes getOperationTimeout returns 20. Is there  reason that it is 2 here?

Line:567, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/ProtocolBaseCase.java -> Yes, it's intentional here to force a timeout.  The comment is right there on line 560.

The goal of this test is to pound the client into timing out, then ensure it still behaves after a little bit of a wait.  This test was added in response to spymemcached issue #35.

Line:581, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/ProtocolBaseCase.java -> get() return a Future<Boolean>. Shouldn't this be get().booleanValue()?

Line:581, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/ProtocolBaseCase.java -> I'd expect that to autounbox.  Autounboxing *might* be less efficient, but it's more readable and won't matter much for a test.
