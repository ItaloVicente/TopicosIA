DESCRIPTION:

Made cmd variable a byte for binary operations.

This variable should have never been an int since it is defined in
the protocol as a byte. The reason for the change is that when we
have opcode that is greater have 127 the value of a byte and an int
are different (Ex. int = 128 byte = -127). This was causing an
assertion to fail, in this case for the getl command (0x94).

So close, but two inconsistencies.  One is my fault for not explicitly tagging it an issue earlier.
Line:34, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/GetlOperationImpl.java -> why the cast here?

Line:61, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/OptimizedSetImpl.java -> slightly inconsistent here, right?  I'd not mentioned this with the other call to the superclass ctor I'd mentioned earlier.
