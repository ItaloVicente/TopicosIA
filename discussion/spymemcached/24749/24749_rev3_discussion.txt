I'm +0 on this.  This is definitely good enough to pass along for evaluation, but I'm slightly concerned about the tests.
Line:32, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/MultiReplicaGetOperationCallback.java -> I'm not super happy with this variable name.  Might be less confusing someday in the future if there's more context in the variable name.

Line:162, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/BinaryOperationFactory.java -> I think all of this cruft and instanceof could be pushed down to a method behind a generic perhaps?  It'd be more readable.  

This works though.

Does the test really test this properly though?  You'd have to modify the test, right?

Line:64, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/ReplicaGetOperationImpl.java -> Is it always STATUS_OK?
