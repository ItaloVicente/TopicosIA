I'm not sure about the JSON parser right now.  It *is* part of the API so it does matter some.  Writing a JSON abstraction is undesirable to me today, though.  :)

I want to note that the changes around the addition of a vBucket map (This change and the next few) are not public api's. This code will never be touched by the user of Spy except for the creation of a MemcachedClient object, but in this case they are only passing in a list of URI's.

Mike, thanks.  If these classes don't infect user apps, I'm not worried about them.

And further to Mike's comment, these are places that bugs can crawl in and hide, but we've been working to mainline a bunch of code that has been effectively in a fork here.  I could have fixed a bunch of this on the fork and merged it, but instead have been trying to fix it by reordering and cleaning up commits.

I believe that at the end of the process, we'll still have things that are below our desired standards, but we can clean that up with future commits.
