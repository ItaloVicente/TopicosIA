Sorry for so many updates.  I can compile it now, though. :/

I'm glad were making progress on this. No worries about all of the commits. You left your eclipse files in here now.

Line:9, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/config/DefaultConfig.java -> Make this final, and remove initialization from here (it is set in the constructor with the rest of them..)

Mike:  The eclipse files were already in there, but they weren't updated with the new things this change brought.
