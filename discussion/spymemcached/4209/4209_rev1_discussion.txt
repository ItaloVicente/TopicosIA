stats cachedump may not work for future memcached versions..
Line:62, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/ProtocolBaseCase.java -> Beware that not all backends supports cachedump, so this may break in the future..

Line:62, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/ProtocolBaseCase.java -> We're already starting to develop issues with this test suite testing the memcached server itself.

That's really a problem I introduced with the test methodology that's been manageable so far, but I knew it was wrong when I did it.  I just didn't want to build the perfect test framework.  It'd be far faster and more reliable, but be a pain to build and I wanted to at least be testing *something*.
