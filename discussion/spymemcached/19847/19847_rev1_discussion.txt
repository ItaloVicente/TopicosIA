DESCRIPTION:

Add the node back to connected during reconnect.  Issue 225.

The connection was being added back a bit later than its
reconnect, causing operations to continue to timeout.  It's
not clear if this is platform specific or not, but this change
is reported to work.

See http://code.google.com/p/spymemcached/issues/detail?id=225

This isn't a self review, I was just having trouble with forgery of author for some reason.  See the google code part.
