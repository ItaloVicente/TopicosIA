DESCRIPTION:

SPY-58: Don't compress json objects

We don't actually parse the whole object. Instead we look
at the first character and if it looks like json then we
don't compress it.

Patch Set 7:

My confusion on the lack of failures was because I neglected to notice the three different transcoders.  This was partially because the flags check was using SerializedTranscoder in all three tests.

I've now verified failure when compression is disabled, starting with the flags check.  The flags check was incorrect before in two of the tests, and possibly really incorrect since it wasn't checking just the one bitfield.

Fixed some checkstyle issues too, and now this commit should be good to go.
