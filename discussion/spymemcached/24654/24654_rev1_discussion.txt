DESCRIPTION:

JCBC-210: Throw CancellationException when future is cancelled.

This changeset throws the semantically more correct
CancellationException when a operation future is cancelled. Old
code that catches RuntimeExceptions will still work, but it allows
for more flexible catching on the application level.

Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

-1 because we shouldn't have a JCBC on a SPY issue.  Please create an underlying issue.  It doesn't need to be long-- it just needs to point to the JCBC really.

This too is a bit smelly, but I don't have a better suggestion at the moment.  Luckily, this isn't the common path.
