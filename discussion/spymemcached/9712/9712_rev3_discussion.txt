DESCRIPTION:

Refactored tap message classes.

These needed to be more readable and were horribly coded (by me). I
started seeing issues with conversion from bytes on the wire to
variables in spy so I changed how this was done.

Patch Set 3: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

I think the decision was, when we discussed this Monday, you were going to review the fields to determine if they should all be accessible.

Does this represent that review?
