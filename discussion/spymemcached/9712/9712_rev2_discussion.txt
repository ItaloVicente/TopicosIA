DESCRIPTION:

Refactored tap message classes.

These needed to be more readable and were horribly coded (by me). I
started seeing issues with conversion from bytes on the wire to
variables in spy so I changed how this was done.

(2 inline comments)

-1 just because of the whitespace issue

These look like really good changes.  The concern I'd have here is that I don't know if our test coverage is good enough that we trust it with this set of changes.  Do you think it is?  How are we testing this?

One other comment, I don't know TAP as well as you do, but it seems odd that we have engine private stuff in here.  Maybe it's needed?  Why should a TapClient know about engines at all?  Abstraction leakage can lead to bigger problems later if something is presumed safe to change behind the abstraction.
Line:51, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/TapOperationImpl.java -> whitespace error here... there may be more.  double check things.

Line:8, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/tapmessage/BaseMessage.java -> These comments don't seem to go with this class.  Perhaps now is a good time to fix this?
