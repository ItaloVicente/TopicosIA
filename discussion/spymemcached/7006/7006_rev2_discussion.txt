DESCRIPTION:

Added all memcached error codes to spymemcached

Previously we only checked a subset of the error codes that
memcached can send back to a client. This created an issue because
if a user recieves an error code that it doesn't expect it resets
the connection. This commit adds all error codes

Patch Set 2: Verified

Added a test here that shoots errors codes through a get operation and checks to make sure that those errors are handled correctly. Note that the error codes are checked in the OperationImpl class so although I only test the get operation this will suffice for testing all operations.

I created the extra class because when I do the Exponential backoff fix that testing code will go into this class.
