DESCRIPTION:

SPY-118: Include more information in the timeout message.

Note: there isn't coherency in this commit, but that is somewhat
intentional to not take on the overhead. The message is on the user's
thread and the updates of last read are on the IO thread.

Patch Set 2:

I changed a few things:

- fix the implementations so all implement the new interface methods (wont compile otherwise)
- adding timeout messages to not only cas (all raised timeouts)
- modifying the test a little bit
- also adding the authenticated info to the message

Important:
- I changed the authenticated method to check from 1 to 0, because of my understanding when the latch is counted down we are authed! (or no auth is needed at all).

Line:203, src/test/java/net/spy/memcached/MockMemcachedNode.java -> Why always true or 0?

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Unfortunately, I think this isn't ready.

L172 of OperationFuture has:
    if (op != null && op.isTimedOut()) {
      throw new ExecutionException(new CheckedOperationTimeoutException(
          "Operation timed out.", op));
    }

I happened to see this during a test.  We'd want connection status there, but we won't have it since that just flows straight through.

I'll try to fix this in a bit.
