Line:79, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClientIF.java -> that one still changes the IF, can you change it back to OperationFuture?

Line:232, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClientIF.java -> I think if @Deprecated, we need to add a javadoc saying why and what people should use instead - can you add that too? thanks!

Patch Set 2:

The main purpose of this ChangeSet was to remove the incorrect use of OperationFuture<T> in the interface. It should have been Future<T> in the first place (If you look at every other method in MemcachedClient that returns an OperationFuture the MemcachedClientIF is Future<T>, I believe it was just a mistake that OperationFuture was exposed in the interface.

I guess there are two choices  
1 .@Deprecate the OperationFuture<T> method and add a Future<T> method.
2. wait for a major release and remove the OperationFuture<T>

As for the broadcastOperation methods.. as I said before I don't believe there is any external use case for them as they are basically internal helper functions for MecachedClient (not MemcachedIF).. So there is no alternative for people to use, they just should not have been exposed in the interface in the first place. If people really need to use them they can cast (or just use) MemcachedClient instead of MemcachedClientIF

Nm 1. doesn't work due to type erasure.. So I guess the only choice is a major version rev.
