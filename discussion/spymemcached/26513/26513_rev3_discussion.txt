DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Add touch to the ASCII protocol.

Touch is defined for the ASCII memcached protocol, but not implemented in
spymemcached. This commit adds the missing touch functionality.

The ant test suite as described in README.markdown does not pass out of the
box (without this commit). Here is a log of the test:

https://gist.github.com/mweiden/19980a35c48a69654ea1

Details of my local setup:

Mac OS X 10.8.3
Memcached 1.4.15
Spymemcached 2.8.12

Tests that fail as reported by ant:

[junit] Test net.spy.memcached.AsciiClientTest FAILED (timeout)
[junit] Test net.spy.memcached.AsciiIPV6ClientTest FAILED (timeout)
[junit] Test net.spy.memcached.BinaryClientTest FAILED (timeout)
[junit] Test net.spy.memcached.BinaryIPV6ClientTest FAILED (timeout)
[junit] Test net.spy.memcached.QueueOverflowTest FAILED
[junit] Test net.spy.memcached.TapTest FAILED

With the new commit added, the touch functionality does work when tested by
hand. These tests still fail.

Originally moved from https://github.com/dustin/java-memcached-client/pull/16

From before: Was there a specific reason that this functionality has not yet
been implemented?

Rebased following instructions from the couchbase "contributing changes".

Please confirm that I did this properly... I am rather new to the flow of Gerrit.

looks good! normally what I do is in the feature branch

git fetch gerrit
git rebase gerrit/master
git push gerrit <branchname>:refs/for/master

that should be enough to rebase against what currently is the latest version
