DESCRIPTION:

Add touch to the ASCII protocol.

Touch is defined for the ASCII memcached protocol, but not implemented in
spymemcached. This commit adds the missing touch functionality.

This changeset also modifies the binary touch to make it work even when
assertions are enabled.

Hi Michael,

Sorry for not getting back to you yesterday, I just returned from a trip...

Your changes look good to me! The touch tests seem to be passing just fine on my local machine, however some of the other tests still fail or have errors. Are these still being ironed out?

Jeah, there are some other flaky tests (how they are implemented), which don't affect this change. On my machine everything passes, I want to give Matt a final chance to eyeball and then its good to go!

Thanks again for your effort here

Question for Matt in the TouchOperation and TouchOperationImpl
Line:4, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/TouchOperation.java -> While there's no significant problem with the copyright and license, it's also slightly inconsistent with the rest of the files in the project and it violates our formatting rules.

Matt: do you or your employer require this?

I definitely want to give credit, but there's no reason for the license block to be here and we don't normally add copyright in the project on a per-file basis.

Responding to Matt's question regarding my inclusion of a copyright block.
Line:4, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ops/TouchOperation.java -> I do not think it's required by SoundCloud. Changing it should not be a problem.

Will you modify this since I do not know the correct convention?
