DESCRIPTION:

[WIP] Add touch to the ASCII protocol.

Touch is defined for the ASCII memcached protocol, but not implemented in
spymemcached. This commit adds the missing touch functionality.

The ant test suite as described in README.markdown does not pass out of the
box (without this commit). Here is a log of the test:

https://gist.github.com/mweiden/19980a35c48a69654ea1

Details of my local setup:

Mac OS X 10.8.3
Memcached 1.4.15
Spymemcached 2.8.12

Tests that fail as reported by ant:

[junit] Test net.spy.memcached.AsciiClientTest FAILED (timeout)
[junit] Test net.spy.memcached.AsciiIPV6ClientTest FAILED (timeout)
[junit] Test net.spy.memcached.BinaryClientTest FAILED (timeout)
[junit] Test net.spy.memcached.BinaryIPV6ClientTest FAILED (timeout)
[junit] Test net.spy.memcached.QueueOverflowTest FAILED
[junit] Test net.spy.memcached.TapTest FAILED

With the new commit added, the touch functionality does work when tested by
hand. These tests still fail.

Originally moved from https://github.com/dustin/java-memcached-client/pull/16

From before: Was there a specific reason that this functionality has not yet
been implemented?

So is this good to test from your side? I could give it a spin if you like

Yes, good to test! I am still not clear as to why these tests fail on my local machine. I do have memcached running locally as suggested int the README. Any ideas? My build log and system details are still in the commit message.

Jeah, some of those tests are suboptimally implemented. I need to give them a separate round of love to make them work reliably.

I'll run your changeset locally and verify that it works properly.. I'll let you know!

Have you considered Travis CI? A Travis status would be a good thing to have on the github page as well so that people who check out the code know whats going on if their tests fail.
