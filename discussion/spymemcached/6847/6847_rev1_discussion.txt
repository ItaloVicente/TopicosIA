DESCRIPTION:

Simplify constructors for creating REST-strapped client.

This removes the deprecated constructor which had only been in the
pre-release.  Pre-release users were made aware that it would go
away before final release.

It also adds a more default constructor.  It really shouldn't be the
default, but the server side never really grew a separation between
bucket name and username, so the client has sprouted a new easier,
more default way to do things.

Line:237, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> going to leave it for now, because it's only a problem in gerrit with the use of tabs.  spaces will fix it.
