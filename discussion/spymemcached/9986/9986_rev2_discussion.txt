DESCRIPTION:

Recognize a query is using a json object and don't quote it

This fixes an issue where sending json object as the value to the
key argument in a query was getting quotes put around it. We now
check to see if something is a json object before we decide to
put quotes around it.

I don't know that this is sufficient, but it seems to be good for now.  We may need to look at this further.
