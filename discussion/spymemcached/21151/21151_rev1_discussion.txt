Don't increment volatile variables

Incrementing a volitile int is not thread safe since it follows
the read/modify/update pattern.

Yep, that's a bug.  I'm only -1 because we don't clean up the comment.  I can fix that up if you haven't time for it though.

Luckily it should have minor to no impact, but we should move to doing things correctly.

And actually, the increment always occurs on the IO thread, so it's still minor.  The reset is always a zero assignment.  There probably is some overhead to the change on the fix, but still good to do things correctly.  :)
