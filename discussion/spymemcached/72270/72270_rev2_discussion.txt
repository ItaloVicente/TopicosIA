DESCRIPTION:

SPY-192: Ensure connection key is valid before checking if writable.

Motivation
----------
It has been discovered in the wild that sometimes CancelledKeyException are
received even if the key has been checked for validity before. It turns out
that the validity can change between the check and the next function call.

Modifications
-------------
The changeset makes sure to check if it is valid on both reading and
subsequent writing, reducing the chance of race conditions and interleaved
state changes.

Result
------
More stable behavior at runtime and less chance of CancelledKeyException.
