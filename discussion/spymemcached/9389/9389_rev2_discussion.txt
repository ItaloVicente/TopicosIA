At the very least, this should have more interesting tests.  I read the discussion on the issue, and I'm not sure I agree with Dustin.  I agree there are way too many methods, but I don't feel so good changing the method signature.

I know where Dustin is coming from, but this would mean a library upgrade would start spewing exceptions.  We've not flagged anyone about this.
Line:1461, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> Hm, not sure we should be changing method signatures here.  At the very least, we need to consider keeping the old method signatures, but that makes the interface rather annoying to implement.

Patch Set 2:

Since this is going in 2.8 I think it is ok since this is just a minor change to the API. I also want to note that we have created MembaseClient in 2.8 so we are already slightly breaking compatibility for people. I think this change is okay in this release. Let's discuss over Skype if you still disagree.
