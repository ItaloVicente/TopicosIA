I believe the concurrency in mutation of NodeLocator instances will lead to bugs.  Like most concurrency bugs, I think they'll lead to strange results and be hard to reproduce, but I think there's an unsafe mix here.
Line:18, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> These variables are used by multiple threads concurrently, but are mutable and cached.

I know I'm being a pain about this whole "final" thing, but I don't see how this can possibly be done correctly.

For example...

Line:38, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/vbucket/VBucketNodeLocator.java -> This method invokes three different methods on the config object (which can very well be three different config objects) before using the result to invoke a method on a map that could've also changed at any point during the invocation of this.

I think it's easy to understand what this will do with a final config and map, but impossible otherwise.
