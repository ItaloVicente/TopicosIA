Line:508, build.xml -> just be aware that optional has no meaning any more in maven.  They recommend separating into multiple jars when you need optional dependencies.   In other words, everyone would need to pick up this Jar.  :(

Line:168, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/ConnectionFactory.java -> interface change means new dot-minor.

Line:374, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/DefaultConnectionFactory.java -> nice, I think this is the right behavior, to allow it to be forced off via a property.

Line:3, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedNode.java -> just a copyright change?

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/metrics/AbstractMetricCollector.java -> no dustin needed here.

Line:29, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/metrics/AbstractMetricCollector.java -> Huh.  I guess this is useful.  Pretty bare though!

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/metrics/DefaultMetricCollector.java -> again, no dustin needed here

Line:2, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/metrics/MetricCollector.java -> ixnay on the ustinday

http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ixnay

Line:53, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/metrics/MetricType.java -> this means DEBUG includes PERFORMANCE?  this may be a bit ambiguious.  That seems to be what you mean though?
