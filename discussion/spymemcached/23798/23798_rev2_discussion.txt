DESCRIPTION:

SPY-107: Ensure state of timedout is known across IO and user threads.

After seeing this in a log, I re-thought through the series of events here.

This flag on the op is known by user threads and the IO thread.  Thus it
is modified in these two different ways:

* operation is created and enqueued
* OperationFuture is returned
* .get() is called on OF
 **timed out**

* operation is removed from input queue
* elapsed time is checked
  **timed out**

Looks good to me, but I'd feel better if we have a test case to cover this
