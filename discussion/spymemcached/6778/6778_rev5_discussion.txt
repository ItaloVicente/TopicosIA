There's nothing majorly wrong in here, but I do have a question that I'm slightly concerned about.  What would the behavior be if someone else holds the lock?  Using this kind of pessimistic lock is pretty indicative that you'll run into that situation somewhat regularly.  Should that be handled with an exception path?  I don't think so... 

Thinking about it API wise, one might want to write something like this...

if (getl("thingA", 30)) {
  if (getl("thingB", 10) && getl("thingC", 10)) { 
    set("thingA", something, cas);
    set("thingB", somethingalso, casalso);
    set("thingB", somethingmore, casmore);
  }
}

(yeah, not getting the cas to re-set it later, but you get the point)

What do you think?  I'm open to arguments to the contrary.
Line:990, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/MemcachedClient.java -> Missing space after the period, and there's a whitespace issue here at the end of the line.  There are a few more in the file too.

Line:74, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/OperationFactory.java -> would be nice to add "in seconds" here too, but it's really minor.

Line:112, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/ascii/BaseGetOpImpl.java -> Hm.  I didn't read this very well the first time.  Might it not be better to use instanceof here?  Not a big deal since I said it was okay earlier, but exception handling is more expensive, I believe.

Line:68, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/binary/GetOperationImpl.java -> Another case where instanceof would be okay I think.

Better would possibly be a more polymorphic approach where the slightly-different-operation impl strips off the key for you, so the caller can just get the data in the format expected.

Thinking more about the last comment, maybe a method to return a boolean on whether or not the lock was obtained would be a step in the right direction.  What do you think?

Sorry to pepper you with questions here, but doesn't the unlock have to have the CAS?  Shouldn't this be more modeled off of a gets()?
