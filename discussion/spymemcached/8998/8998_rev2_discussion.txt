DESCRIPTION:

Added interface for view rows called ViewRow

Each row type that can be sent back from a view now has
getter functions for every possible field. If a field doesn't
exist for that view row and UnsupportedOperationException is
thrown. This new interface is now the only user facing object
that will be seen when dealing with view rows and as a result
makes the code simpler to use.

Patch Set 2: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

(4 inline comments)

Generally makes sense, but feel like I'd need to use the API a bit to feel comfortable with it.  I think you've probably done that.

The downside to this is that we're losing compile time checking of some things.  It seems like a win overall though.

I nearly gave a +1, but that one set of nulling can probably be better and I expect you're planning a new patchset anyway.
Line:11, /COMMIT_MSG -> minor typo.  "an" instead of and.

Line:24, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/couch/RowReduced.java -> nitpick: probably shouldn't have an apostrophe.  you seem fond of them.  :)

Line:11, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/couch/RowWithDocs.java -> Shouldn't this just live in a method then?  Why have the same code here three times.  A nullifier method with varargs seems appropriate and more readable.

Line:5, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/protocol/couch/ViewRow.java -> whitespace!
