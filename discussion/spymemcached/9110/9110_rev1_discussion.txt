DESCRIPTION:

Fixed issue with the CouchDB connection not closing.

MemcachedConnection was returning false when the shutdown
function was called even when the connection was closed correctly.
As a result the CouchConnection wasn't shutting down properly. The
issue had to do with having false be the default return value when
it should have been true.

Especially since it's so simple, and had been a bug for quite a while, it'd be good to add a unit test for this.  Build a connection, then call shutdown, verify that it's coming back correctly.
