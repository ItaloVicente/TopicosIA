||at the beginning of the line is part of the format we use. I did go through and fix lines that start with a period where fixable.

Patch Set 8:

to be clear, I expect the || at the start of some lines.  there were places where for readability, it was all || at the start of the line previously, but they were all scrunched together in one or two lines after refromatting.
