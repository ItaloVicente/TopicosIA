Are there other changes that require this coming?  If so, it should probably be part of the same commit.

I thought this was already tried, but had to be pulled out because the  BeanFactory isn't generic until Spring 3.0, so was therefore blowing up on Spring 2.5.

Has the underlying Spring 'dependency' been upped to 3.0?

@Nelz I'm seeing our version of spring as 3.0.3.RELEASE so if that was the case then we should be ok now.

Patch Set 1: Looks good to me, but someone else must approve

Ok. Looks good.

My only other 'druther is for someone to specify in the docs (maybe at http://code.google.com/p/spymemcached/wiki/SpringIntegration ?) that the required version of Spring is 3.0+ as of whatever release this gets into.

I didn't even think about the compatibility issue here that others may have. (I have little knowledge of spring too). I think I'm going to leave this as is then and not submit since we don't really have any particular reason to making people upgrade their spring jar.

This will require users to upgrade from spring 2.6 to 3.0. I really made this change because my IDE was giving me a warning and this isn't a good enough reason to make people upgrade their spring jars.
