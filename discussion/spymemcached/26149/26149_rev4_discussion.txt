DESCRIPTION:

SPY-120: Adding support for SLF4J logging.

This changeset adds support for SLF4J logging. The Logger API
has been modified to contain only very small backwards breaking
changes, it only adds TRACE support to the interface. People
not implementing the Interface directly but just implementing
the AbstractLogger only need to add the new isTraceEnabled()
method and inside the log() method also check for the TRACE
level.

As SLF4J implies, this changeset does not ship with an
actual SLF4J implementation but lets you choose it at runtime
with just adding the impl to the classpath.

While I definitely agree with Jonas, I just know that if we ship something that changes the defaults, we'll hear about it from users at the most inopportune time.

I'd also like to go the other way with this so we could *use* slf4j in this and the couchbase client.

Still, this is a great incremental improvement and we can switch over entirely in 3.0.

Tested to work as expected.
Line:475, build.xml -> The only problem here is that optional is not really well handled in Maven.  In fact, I think it was deprecated.

Line:31, ivy/libraries.properties -> better to depend on an older version? or that plus?  this is one of those common dependencies, so I'm not sure that we depend strictly on the 1.7.5.
