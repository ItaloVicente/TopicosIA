DESCRIPTION:

Adding support for SLF4J logging.

This changeset adds support for SLF4J logging. The Logger API
has been modified to contain only very small backwards breaking
changes, it only adds TRACE support to the interface. People
not implementing the Interface directly but just implementing
the AbstractLogger only need to add the new isTraceEnabled()
method and inside the log() method also check for the TRACE
level.

As SLF4J implies, this changeset does not ship with an
actual SLF4J implementation but lets you choose it at runtime
with just adding the impl to the classpath.

I need to take it for a spin with a real app, but generally I think this is the right direction.

-1 is for a couple of reasons.  First, typos.  :)  Second, we really should update the javadoc and README with a description of how to enable options and make a recommendation.  This can probably be about the same text.
Line:26, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/compat/log/SLF4JLogger.java -> whoops, missing an h there.

Line:35, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/compat/log/SLF4JLogger.java -> you mean FATAL not FATAl ?

Line:52, src/main/java/net/spy/memcached/compat/log/SLF4JLogger.java -> These could be clarified, as logging can still be enabled for Trace, but the logger can be configured to not log trace to anywhere.  This always trips up people with the Sun logging since it filters on many levels.

Guys,

I think we are going in the wrong direction. The simpler solution is better. The proposed patches bring back a internal log system that the application doesn't need.

As verified by Michael concerns about the users not setting up their logs are handled gracefully by slf4j.

Matt, I agree with semver. But in this case we should update the release and remove the internal log instead of adapting the current solution to add slf4j support.

If you guys want I can rebase my patch. :)
